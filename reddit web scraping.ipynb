      "content of comments: (0 children)I don't think the hardware will be different, but I think there is a better way if you are sure you want to have Windows on the machine in the future:The reason why this might be better is because the Windows license will be digital and stored in your BIOS' NVRAM (CMOS settings). With that license, you can completely wipe off Windows, run the machine with just Linux, and later put back Windows and the license will still be valid and be used to automatically activate Windows. When you re-install Windows, you can get drivers from the Dell Support website:https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/xps-13-9315-laptop/driversIf you buy the Linux-only version, you'll later need to buy a Windows license which is usually more expensive. However, if you're uncertain about later using Windows, this might be the better option for you because you don't pay for something - a Windows license - that you might not use.HTH.\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)The XPS' starting with 7 are using an older naming scheme. They're just older.The current naming scheme is, that the first digit states that it's XPS, the second states its screen size (5 for 15.6\", XPS 15), the third the generation (2 being second generation using the current naming scheme) and the last digit is reserved for speciel versions, like 5 for the current XPS 13, to differentiate it from the 13 Plus.Other product lines use the same naming scheme, but differently. For example the Precision 5570 which is a slightly changed XPS 9520. There has also been overlaps, so different product lines have had the same number, so it's important to also consider the product line, for example XPS, Precision, Inspiron etc.I have the current XPS 15 9520, but the new one is coming out in about half a year, if you can wait for it.[–]reckless-saving -1 points0 points1 point 12 days ago(1 child)First digit denotes whether a i5, i7 or i9 chip is used, the speed differences at the top say i7 to say bottom i9 maybe immaterial unless you have a specific user case that benefits from the faster speed.

      "content of comments: (0 children)Sleep mode in modern PCs is function garbage ​Instead of S3 sleep, the one you're probably familar with, XPS's from 9500 onwards use 'modern' sleep, that functions about as well as sand does as a lubricant To the point where it is physically not possible to reinable. If I had to guess, the sheer amount of ram that needs to be backed up and wired back in is causing latency.​But yeah, I did a 64gb upgrade on my 9510 and I just reboot every time, figured the speed of reboot is fine and better practice maintenance wise to be able to shut down when I need toBut yeah if you're willing to look into it, I'd recommend looking at what sleep mode you use. I had issues with Jumping cursors, the article below, although for an old Dell, lists the touch pad as a source of issues  https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/h0r56s/getting\\_back\\_s3\\_sleep\\_and\\_disabling\\_modern/[–]Just-Helicopter-6352[S] 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago(1 child)Thanks for the help guys.I reversed back to 32gb and the lag is gone. If I think about it, it's more like an latency for the most part. But you feel it pretty clearly. It feels like an performance decline.What would be my next step ? ​Is it possible the new 64ggb RAM kit is not working as it should or do I have to change settings in my BIOS ?[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago(0 children)The only thing I can think of which might explain this is that the Crucial memory is operating at the wrong speed. You can see what it is doing by opening Task Manager (ctrl-shift-esc) > Performance tab > Memory panel > look at the \"Speed:\" line. It should be 4800MHz.Programs like HWInfo can also show you what speed each memory stick is operating at.I have one Crucial 32GB stick in my 9520 along with 1 of the original 8GB sticks and it's fine: no performance issues and even though it operates in single channel mode, I don't notice any \"lags\" or such.You could try swapping one stick at a time (so use it with 1 x 8GB and 1 x 32GB) and see if it operates at 4800MHz - it should because that's what my machine does.In case you're not aware, the BIOS will perform a full system check whenever you change the hardware configuration, so after changing your RAM, the machine will start up and appear to do nothing at the Dell logo for several minutes. This is normal. Just wait for the system check to finish.HTH.[–]Bamm83 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago(1 child)I have the exact same model of Dell with 64gb of crucial in it and haven't dealt with any lag or issues with win11 pro.

I was wondering how I could fix this[–]RyRy79261 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago(1 child)u/shlooby123 so the click sensation from the touch pad relies on 2 things  The top fixture where the touch pad fits in (the side near to the pcb) and the point in the middle, at the bottom, near the edge of the laptop. In later models like the 9510, there is a small round plastic circle, thats functionally like a piece of tape, that sits below a clicking mechanism I'm fairly certain the part I'm refering to is the haptic click actuator, but when I was swapping out a palm rest assembly, I noticed the 9500 vs the 9510 has this circular tap thing thereThe fitting of this is critical to the haptic click in my experience. It would be difficult for me to advise what to do without images of your assembly but thats what I had to focus on to get the click back Another thing that can mute the haptic feed back is the actual frame, if you were to say, pick up the laptop by the left or right part of the assembly, the part closest to you when open, this can mute the click while that torsion is presentWhat I mean by this, is you might have slightly bent the assembly during the dismantling process, before doing anything drastic, I am literally guessing at this point.   But yeah its a some what delicate installation for that haptic clicker to work at the correct pressure​One issue I found when I was servicing a 9570, is that the clicker doesnt occur if the touchpad is fitted too snuggle in the palm assembly, essentially not having enough give for the click to occur in the usual way​But yeah I'm not a registered technician, I've just been servicing my own xps's for the last 4 years and thats all the notes I have on this issue[–]shlooby123[S] 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago(0 children)This is very helpful. thank you so much I'll take a look at it again.

      "content: ​ so i emailed dell about several issues i was having with my laptop including a hinge problem when my laptop was under warranty. they responded but recommended only software solutions. they then emailed to confirm solution but i couldn't get back to them as i was abroad and thus they close the request. the warranty then ended and my laptop's hinge was coming loose. i took it to an it repair centre to fix it but they didn't finish the job and made it worse. when i opened the laptop, it wouldn't close as the hinges were fully out and bending against the screen. a few moments later the screen broke and there were lines all across it. my question is would there be any chance dell would repair this for free if i emailed them. or could i buy warranty for it and request them to fix it - i would feel bad about doing this if it was my fault it broke but it wasn't. thanks tldr: could i buy warranty and ask dell to fix my laptop?\n",

I’m only familiar with the 9510 and mine heats up quite a bit while running basic programs like excel so I would assume that it throttles. If I am not mistake, the 9520 is basically the same under the hood with a newer processor.[–]rwrife[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)I just re-pasted the heat pipe with some Kyronaut and I’m able to get Geekbench multi-core scores in the 11,500 range, but I really expect the HK CPU to easily outperform the H CPU in a more confined chassis…from this I think I’m comfortable saying the 5470 is probably the best Dell laptop I’ve used in a long time (also have a XPS 13 and XPS Plus).[–]nothingspecialva 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago(3 children)Interesting comparison. of course, if you only repasted one of them, it is a bit unfair. more importantly, the Geekbench is very very short test. if you really want to test the thermals, run say CPU-Z stress test for 20 minutes and comeback and check at what speed is running the CPU. or if you have it, do a FireStrike Benchmark and Stress Test.lastely, it might be powerful, but who want to work for long hours in a claustrophobic 14\" screen?[–]rwrife[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(2 children)I was too lazy to install 3D Mark, but I did install Cinebench R23 and I'm getting around 12,000 on the multi-core test on both systems on the balanced power profile....I guess it's safe to say that it comes down to if you want a bigger screen and comically large trackpad, then go XPS, if you want portability and a lighter wallet, then go Precision.[–]nothingspecialva 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)many thanks for the reply. well said.

      "content of comments: (0 children)Every single XPS or Alienware PC I've come across has had cooling issues. They often perform ok when brand new but it doesn't take them long to develop issues. In my opinion the cooling supplied with those machines are borderline sufficient so it doesn't take long to out grow the stock unit.Particularly relevant if you're overclocking  or intend to in the future.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(10 children)First, there shouldn't be a cooling problem to begin with. It doesn't make sense for Dell to sell PCs with cooling problems.​Youtube has quite a few videos about how to upgrade your cooling systemit might make sense to upgrade the cooling system but usually it's done when there is a good reason to do so, not because of some perceived problem with the cooling system.Remember the adage: \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\". I doubt the PC will come with a broken cooling system.​should I order a i9-12900kif you have a reason to get this CPU, then get it. For most people, it's not worth the extra cost (Intel makes most of its profits when it sells its priciest CPUs).If you're only doing general productivity work or general web browsing, there's no benefit because most of the time, your CPU will be idle. Even many games cannot use the full capability of the highest CPU, which makes sense because game makers want their games to work well on less powerful system (such as systems from 3-4 years ago).So ask yourself: what is the benefit to me in getting the i9 over the i7? If you cannot come up with a compelling reason, don't get it.The same logic applies for the the i7-12700K over the i7-12700. The K is \"unlocked\" so it's overclockable. The non-K isn't so unless you intend to overclock, there's no benefit to getting the K version.HTH.[–]rkarl7777[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(9 children)i7-12700KI haven't seen a Dell XPS desktop with a i7-12700K processor.  Have you?  The i9-12900K offers an \"Advanced Cooling System\".  That's the only reason I was considering it.  While I'm not intending to overclock, I am intending to put a heavy load on the system and am concerned about overheating and throttling.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*(8 children)I haven't seen a Dell XPS desktop with a i7-12700K processor.

I am intending to put a heavy load on the system and am concerned about overheating and throttling.I don't have direct experience with this PC so I cannot tell you whether it's worth getting the Advanced Cooling System. You probably should search for reviews about it in r/DellXPS, r/XPS and r/Dell.The only articles I could find on advanced cooling are:https://www.reddit.com/r/DellXPS/comments/tchxrn/xps_9850_cpu_cooling_experiences_recommendations/https://www.dell.com/community/XPS-Desktops/XPS-8950-Advanced-Air-Cooling-i5-12600K-thermals-and-noise/td-p/8216629Because you know you're going to push the system harder than most users, it's probably better to spring for a better cooling system. It might be better in future to include your intentions in your initial posting so it will \"cut to the chase\" when discussing your decision making.HTH.[–]rkarl7777[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(7 children)Thanks for the cooling links.  I will check them out.[–]dull_lightbulb 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(6 children)Hi! I'm also looking at getting an XPS 8950. The spec I'm looking at is the i7-12700 (non-K) with an RTX 3090. Like you, I am curious about the Dell cooler situation, as I've heard the Dell \"pancake\" cooler is terrible.  Also like you, I've watched a few ~1-year-old videos about upgrading from that \"pancake\" cooler to the beefier air cooler.Here is a Dell forums thread with images of the 2023 air cooling options; it seems that the \"Standard\" cooler is the infamous pancake one and the \"Advanced\" cooler is the one that people were upgrading to.For me, it is free to upgrade from Standard to Advanced on Dell's website. Is it also free for you? If so, I would certainly recommend it. My plan is to see how well it works and then get a better, 3rd party cooling solution (e.g., Noctua NH-U9S) if needed. A YouTube video which I believe may help us down that road is here.At first, I was tempted to spend the $50 on the Dell AIO liquid cooler, but reviews seem mixed. I don't know much about cooling or liquid cooling at all, but I've heard that mid- to high-tier air coolers can match/beat low-tier liquid AIOs, and the Dell AIO seems like it's pretty low-tier to me. Hope this info helps![–]rkarl7777[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*(5 children)Sounds like we are in similar situations.  I finally found a i7-12700k system on the U.S. Dell site.  As for AIO liquid cooling systems, I saw a Linus Tech video in which an air cooler beat a liquid cooler.  Also, somewhere I read  that they are not silent.  I would rather get a quiet air cooler.[–]dull_lightbulb 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(4 children)I'm also shopping in the US, so that's odd. One thing I did forget to mention is that I am customizing my system - rather than shopping among the pre-built ones that Dell keeps in-stock.For example, here is the base config that I'm using, but I'm adding the white case with the 750 W PSU. This base config has an i7-12700 (non-K), 32 GB RAM, and an RTX 3090. For what it's worth, it also has Advanced CPU air cooling - so perhaps it's another one to add your list?What specific specs are you looking at getting, and what's your budget, if I may ask? I think the RTX 3090 spec for $2,350 is a pretty good deal in terms of performance-per-dollar, but it's still relatively expensive. It's worth considering only if it's within/near your budget and you could take advantage of having a 3090.[–]rkarl7777[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(3 children)You system looks very nice, but the GPU is overkill for me.  I've found a similar system with a smaller GPU that's almost perfect for my needs.  I just wish I could add a 2nd SSD.[–]dull_lightbulb 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*(2 children)Do you mean from Dell? Because if you're comfortable with doing it yourself, it's usually much cheaper to buy an SSD online and pop it in yourself rather than get additional storage from the factory.This page has some detailed information on the storage configurations possible with the XPS 8950. Here's a YouTube video of someone installing an M.2 drive in the second slot, in case you'd like to see the process. Hopefully this helps!Edit: If you're looking for fast storage you can get an M.2 NVMe SSD like this one that is capable of 5,000 MB/s read and 4,400 MB/s write. There are even faster ones available, but the XPS 8950 is capable of PCIe Gen 4, so look for that at a minimum. From what I'm seeing, it's about $80-$100/TB. Otherwise, if you just need SSD storage but the regular 500 MB/s SATA speeds are fine, then traditional 2.5\" SSDs are even cheaper at around $50-$70/TB. If you already know all this, then I apologize, but I just wanted to put it out there in case it helps![–]rkarl7777[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)I didn't know there was an open slot for a 2nd SSD.  That solves my only remaining issue.  Thank you so much for your great advice and helpful links.  Hopefully, we will both be enjoying our shiny new XPS 8950s soon!\n",

Since the software you intend to use doesn't require a beefy GPU, you can probably go ahead and get it with just the integrated graphics.If you later use software that requires more than the integrated graphics, you would just use your super high end desktop to run it.I have a XPS 9520 with a dGPU. Aside from Adobe Photoshop, I've never needed the dGPU for any software I use (I don't play games on it). Everything else has been using the iGPU.Note that some XPS configurations which ship with just the iGPU will also come with the smaller 56Wh battery (whereas dGPU configurations will come with the 86Wh battery). If you get a used machine with the smaller battery, you might want to consider getting the larger battery (especially if the used machine's battery is worn out).

Fingerprint works (a big help with my long password) and I'm going to bring up the IPU6 camera driver this weekend if I get time and see how that goes.I wish I could adjust the touchpad's sensitivity (there's gotta be a way, but I'm using the \"HID Multitouch\" driver for the touchscreen and touchpad (and presumably the pen) so not sure where to look) but RN I'm satisfied.[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(13 children)Thank you for the update, I hope 6.1 makes its way to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS soon[–]hereforthepix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(12 children)Thanks for the Golds, and do you have any software-building experience?The only thing I really did different from the Ubuntu stock Git kernel tree was take the time to develop a defconfig specifically for the XPS-9320 (I don't like that \"module soup\" that a general-purpose distro kernel gives, plus I built with clang tuned for alderlake).[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(2 children)Yes, I have software building experience, with C many years ago, recently developing apps for iOS. I am technology professional as well.[–]hereforthepix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Oh then let me write up the steps and make a new post so you can try a new kernel. Do you have the Plus with touch?The only \"tricky\" part was I'd needed newer binary blobs from the linux-firmware git, but still some from Ubuntu so I merged them into a separate git tree (not strictly necessary, you could just copy)BTW, I saw your note about running Xanmod- it's not secure-boot-enabled, right? Ubuntu is enabling lockdown by default in SB mode with NO way to disable it (😡) and that disables Hibernate (and 3rd party modules like VMWare).[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Yes, 13 Plus with Touch, but I have Touch disabled in the BIOS, I don't use it.I have Secure Boot also disabled it in the BIOS, and Ubuntu 22.04 installed without any problem.With the original Ubuntu 22.04 kernel 5.15 I was able to setup Hibernation without any problem (Secure Boot disabled in BIOS), but when I installed XanMod, hibernation stopped working.Thank you for putting the instructions, I really appreciate it.[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(8 children)I installed the XanMod kernel 6.1.3, everything seems to be working ok, only Hibernation stopped working, I don't understand why, it was working fine with 5.15 (the default Ubuntu 22.04 kernel).I will test the Suspend/Sleep battery drainage tonight.[–]hereforthepix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(7 children)Make sure you re-enable VMD/RAID in the BIOS, there's a fix for post-VMD PCIe bus L1/L0 ASPM states now (which was why Linux had higher s0ix battery drain).[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(2 children)Thank you for this tip, I have re-enabled VMD/RAID in the BIOS, booted into 6.1.3 without any problem, I will restart the overnight Suspend/Sleep test.With the standard 5.15 kernel I was draining around 7-8% in a 12 hours period, while in suspend mode.[–]hereforthepix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Unfortunately, without any tweaks (I need to ensure I'm not waking up for any reason) that still sounds about right re: the battery drain. I remember my old HP would go weeks in S3, today's S3 hardware maybe a week at best now 😐and this \"Modern\" Suspend even worse[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)I agree, at most a week.[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(3 children)I have a USB-C power meter connected between the AC adapter and the laptop, with VMD/RAID, the idle power consumption measured by the meter is around 0.180 Watts, with AHCI enabled that idle power goes down to 0.005-0.010 Watts, weird.[–]hereforthepix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Interesting- which kernel, and what do you mean by \"idle\"? S0ix sleep, or just idle?[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Yes, S0ix sleep.Last night with XanMod 6.1.3, it used in Sleep S0ix, around 5-6%, instead of 7-8%, small difference, but not big enough to sacrifice Hibernation, I might go back to the default Ubuntu 5.15 kernel, and try enabling VMD/RAID and see the results there.[–]hereforthepix 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)I was looking at the kernel trees, and you're right- the commits to enable PCIe ASPM states behind VMD bridges is in Ubuntu's kernel, but not Linus' (so presumably neither Xanmod).\n",

If, for whatever reason you managed to bypass the onboard graphics and run all of the desktop from the Nvidia graphics card, your next post is going to be, \"I'm scrolling through the Start Menu and keep getting a BSOD.\"I've been working with Nvidia cards since the Riva TNT back in the Windows 98 days. They have never been good for everyday desktop use. This arrangement where an onboard Intel or Radeon GPU takes care of most of the rendering and Nvidia GPUs are only used for 3D rendering, modeling and gaming, is probably the best thing that could've happened to Nvidia. They get to shine where they are really good and avoid the faceplant where they are not.[–]RyRy79261 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago(0 children)I've spent a good deal of time trying to extract a lot of power from this recent line of xps's ​If you want to force dedicated, I believe thats a setting in the bios. Alternatively, you can specify which programs use which graphics via Nvidia and I think theres a screen in windows some where too​u/RobertoC_73 covered it but you really dont want your Nvidia card handling everything, the system isn't designed for that amount of through put permanently.

The computer isn’t doing anything.[–]Hikaru755 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(3 children)Ah, so the original charger is also plugged in? Well as far as I know, laptops can't charge from two potential charging sources at once, so it might be that even though the official charger is connected, the monitor was connected first and gets priority because of that, and if it's underpowered for the demands of the laptop, that can mean it will still discharge.I'm assuming if you unplug the monitor, it should switch over to the original charger and charge up properly. It you then plug in the monitor again later, does it still show the same behavior?[–]Simone1998[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(2 children)Yes, I tried exactly as you suggested and the issue is still there.[–]Hikaru755 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Hm, I guess at that point it's probably a good idea to get in contact with Dell directly and ask if that's expected behavior, and how to fix it. Can't imagine that it's intended for the laptop to just not be properly usable while a USB-PD display is connected directly.[–]Simone1998[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)I called Dell, they told me it is an issue but it's not covered since I bought the laptop 18 months. They also replaced the motherboard 4 months ago but still refuse to replace it.  I will never buy a Dell again.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)my laptop discharges while using an external display with USB-DP while being under charge concurrentlythis is probably what is supposed to happen. The 9710 normally uses a 130W charger. The \"normal\" USB-Power Delivery (USB-PD) spec. allows USB-C connectors to supply up to 90W.So how come the 9710 uses a 130W charger with USB-C? Because Dell uses a proprietary charging protocol. This is a protocol that only the in-box charger and the Dell Thunderbolt docks support. Third party chargers (including monitors which support USB-PD) must follow the public USB-PD specification which means 90W maximum.Some monitors only supply 60W-65W via USB-PD and that's about half of what the 9710 requires for charging. You'll need to check the specs. for your monitor to see what it's supplying.The only solution is to use the in-box charger or a Dell Thunderbolt dock since the 9710 needs 130W to charge effectively (otherwise it can discharge as you have found). Since the 9710 has multiple USB-C ports, you can plug in the charger and the monitor at the same time (it will charge using the charger and no power will be supplied from the monitor).​the external monitor is recognized with the right resolution 3440*1440 only when using the USB-DP, and is recognized as a 2560*1080 with HDMIyou'll need to check the monitor's specs. Some monitors support certain resolutions and refresh rates on certain ports and different resolutions/rates on other ports.HTH.[–]Simone1998[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)It is under charge with its original 130 W charger.[–]PhoenixProtocol 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)I have had the same issue, XPS 9710 using a Dell Ultra Sharp display. Got it connected just through one usb-c cable to the screen but nonetheless the display only provides 90W. It only discharges if I do anything ‘intens’ such as playing newer games on max everything, if not if will just sit and charge at 90W albeit slower. In case I do need the full power there’s 2 things that solved it for me that both work. As mentioned earlier, making sure your 130W charger is plugged in first seems to be a common solution, but somehow on my 9710 it only works if I have it plugged in when the pc starts, and then plug in the screen when windows is booted up (only have to do this once until I unplug/move my laptop altogether).Other simple option is to just turn charging off on you DP, maybe depends on the screen but in my own case I just have the option in the screen settings.\n",

I just returned my xps 9320 due to a range of issues that it had on Linux as well as Windows.Gnome would double type the first keystroke in a search, redshift and night mode conflicted, leaving only night mode usable which is not as flexible. Software driven click feel. This means even though you d have a form press to select text, it would \"click\" three or four times which would fubar your selection. Two finger scrolling would also randomly select text which stops scrolling and selects your page which gets annoying while trying to surf. The deal breaker for me was the tocuhbar will randomly stop responding depending on the heat of the unit. Since the ESC could not reliably be available, sometimes I couldn't save my work in vim.Decided to try windows 11 and WSLv2. Ha. Permissions all messed up with 777 being a requirement so windows can access it, which really hoses up your ssh keys needing a 400 so you need to use symlinks outside the reach of linux. Copying output into xclip from subsystem Linux that would store it in my clipboard in windows, would crash any program I paste it into.Yeah no thanks to both of those things. Sleek looking and great feel, but, awful awful hardware quality.[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)It seems you had mostly Touch Bar and Touchpad issues?Regarding the laptop being hot, was that on Linux? I have run Ubuntu on the 9310 (last year model) and it always run super cool.What other hardware problems did you find?Thanks[–]w00tburger 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Its an Intel 12th gen. It ran hot on windows and linux when it was under use of heavy multitasking or running a game. Trackpad issues, touchbar issues sums it up. Touchbar controling an exit key and the brightness is a fairly big deal.[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Agree, not good quality for a premium laptop\n",

      "content of comments: (8 children)Yes, the XPS 15[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(7 children)Thanks. I’m looking to buy one but I have listened very negative comments from people. Some have complained about the battery, mouse pad and some have complained regarding the overheating issue.[–]alv80 5 points6 points7 points 2 months ago(0 children)The thing is you’re most often only going to read online about people who have issues. I’m a long-time XPS power user of half a dozen XPS models but you won’t find many complaints written by me because all of my units over the years since 2015, gave me very few issues so  didn’t get online to report anything. I know of at least 2 friends who also have an XPS with no serious issues otherwise they would have talked to me about them first.[–]Otherwise-Payment-90 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(5 children)I would stay away from the 13\" line because that's where I had all those problems you named, and it is not upgradable. I recently returned my XPS 13 plus for an XPS 15, and it is a much better machine, although it is bigger (15.6\" laptop, but is the size of a 14\" one). ​Your battery will vary especially if you get the OLED or UHD+ version. I find my heat and battery life has been fine. I also still have my XPS 13 9360, and I've only had to replace the battery after a few years.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(4 children)Thanks for the info. Regarding the screen I’m thinking to get basic screen as I always connect laptop to external monitors. I rarely use laptop screen.[–]Otherwise-Payment-90 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(3 children)Then your battery life should be just fine especially if you do some tweaks found on this very subreddit. A lot of the issues with the battery are directly the fault of Windows 11 and how inefficient it can be on laptops. ​I honestly did not even have to do a fresh install of Windows, just a few software tweaks in the settings like when to use the dGPU, and even with an OLED screen, my battery life is pretty good. Also, use hibernation and not Sleep if you decide to buy the XPS 15.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)Thanks for suggestions. I’m really looking forward to XPS now. One more question, can you easily connect 3 external monitors to it? Without any limitations?[–]Otherwise-Payment-90 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(1 child)Unfortunately, I can't answer that for you as I only use one, but so far, everything has been smooth. I did see some Youtubers say it ran great with multiple monitors w/ a dock, but I can't speak on it personally.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)No problem. I appreciate all the help. I’m really looking forward to XPS now. :)[–]getoutdoors99 5 points6 points7 points 2 months ago(3 children)Absolutely. Have an XPS 15 WITH OLED and the on the basis of the screen and form factor alone, it's an easy device to recommend.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)I’m also looking at XPS 15 with 64GB Ram. I wanted to know the experience from users before I buy. I’m also a windows user and I have tried switching to mac but just couldn’t do it. I love the Windows experience.[–]getoutdoors99 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago(1 child)I went xps15 with the i7/32gb/1tb. After uninstalling a few utilities and bloaty apps, and after reaquainting myself with a few Dell-ism, it's just an incredible machine. Coming from a surface laptop 10th gen Intel. The OLED screen on the XPS literally turns heads at airports and such (actually - \"what laptop is that?\")[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(0 children)That’s positive to know. :)[–]throwMeAwayTa 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago(3 children)It depends what their needs are.I've had bad experiences overall, but the line is still the most suited to my needs.Also had worse experiences with MBPs.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)What kind of bad experiences you had with MBPs?[–]throwMeAwayTa 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(1 child)MacOS generally.Screens need replacing, hinges going.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)I agree with MacOS part[–]carey_medsci 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(0 children)I got a xps 13 plus.

And how far back does the lid go?[–]alv80 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(3 children)I’ve had the top spec of almost every generation of the 15 and 17 since the 9550 in late 2015. I always upgrade the RAM and SSD. I’ve had very few issues with any of them. I’ve recommended the XPS to a lot of people over the years. I’ll still recommend them to people who are willing to buy in that price range and want arguably the best Windows laptops. I currently have an XPS 17 but I find myself using my MSI Prestige 15 4K more often because I travel a lot and it’s so much lighter and it’s something I already had (instead of buying an XPS 15 or 13). After a lot of consideration and a lifetime of using and liking Windows (most of the time), I finally decided to switch to the next MacBook Pro 16 when it becomes available with the M2 Max or whatever CPU is launching next. I’m not a fan of macOS and the XPS offers a better display and with thinner bezels that look much better. But the Apple M chips, much longer real-world battery life, and the integration with my iPhone, iPad, watch, and Apple TV, with my feet dragging, finally made me decide to switch.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago(2 children)I appreciate your detailed information. I currently have Dell G7 17. I just can’t decide between XPS or Mac. I tend towards windows more and more.[–]alv80 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(1 child)As you’ve probably heard a million times, if you’re heavy into gaming then stick with Windows. Otherwise if you don’t mind the Apple tax, it would come down to which do you prefer. The XPS line is as close as you’re going to find in terms of a Windows laptop being close to the MBP build quality. I used an M1 MBP 16 for a few days and I hated to admit it but the thing is really good at a lot of things. It never got too hot underneath and I finally felt like I could use a laptop for a day without the power brick coming with me.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 2 points3 points4 points 2 months ago(0 children)This is similar what happened with me. I bought MBP M1 and returned it. The battery was great and processing speed was amazing. However, I was unable to run Bluestacks, couldn’t use 3 monitors and some other little things made me return it. But it was one solid build.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago*(3 children)The only answer I can offer is \"it depends\". That's because it depends on what you intend to use the machine for.As a gaming machine, it's not great (thermally limited).As an all-day battery life machine, it's doable but you have to make sure that a lot of battery sapping things aren't happening.As a code development machine, it's been good for me (I build C++ programs with it).As a virtual machine host, it's good (once you upgrade the RAM to 32GB or more).As a media consumption machine, I like it (I have the XPS 15 with UHD+ screen).As an audio production machine, it's probably no. There was a recent post about it and it was horrible for the poster:https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/zo54j4/dell_xps_9520_the_worst_laptop_i_have_ever_owned/See? It depends.HTH.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)Thanks for the detailed information. I don’t play games at all. I mainly use for photoshop, online business which mostly uses google chrome and I run Bluestacks all the time as I use it for my security camera monitoring.Occasionally I run MS Visual Studio for some internal business development[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(1 child)The XPS 15 is a \"prosumer\" PC so it will fit your needs fine. With RAM and SSD upgradability (it has 2 M.2 slots so you can later install a second SSD) it will probably serve you well for many years. You might also consider the XPS 17 if you prefer a \"desktop replacement\" kind of laptop.[–]AmbassadorCapital195[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Thanks for the information. I rarely use the laptop screen. It’s always connected to the external monitors.[–]Crafty_Ad4641 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)I have an xps13 2in1 for 4 years and it's been perfect. Battery life isn't great anymore at 2hrs[–]Joyrenee22 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)I have been loving my 9520 for the last few months, battery life could be better - but I'm usually able to get all the use I want out of it. Power is great, able to game on it to a moderate level (can pretty consistently get 60 fps on high settings, which is good enough for me) and the screen, speakers, build quality, is all great. Haven't had any issues, and highly recommend the 9520.\n",

I had the XPS 13 plus about 10 days ago and I returned it because of what you mentioned. Out of the box it lagged and I had much less bloatware because I opted for Windows 11 Pro. The fan seemed to be always running, it was hot, and the seamless touchpad just was kind of meh.If you don't mind a bigger laptop (14\"inch) and are still in the return window,  I would opted for the XPS15 9520. I've have a better experience with the 15 and I haven't had any problems. It's smaller than a traditional 15.6 inch laptop as it fits in a 14inch carrying case and I still have space.You also get a dedicated GPU and upgradability.If not, I hope Dell sorts everything out for you as the laptop isn't cheap and should not be functioning as so.No problem, glad to help.[–]AmadeusVulture[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago(1 child)Thanks for the tip, I'll keep it in mind but I just pulled the trigger on the Acer Swift X 14 (2022), as suggested by a couple of other commenters. They were open about their affiliated links and so I did a reasonable amount of reading around before agreeing. I also happened upon a refurb option that was £500 off RRP, plus I got a working voucher, so ended up with the Ryzen 7, 1TB version for £699. That's definitely worth a gamble!\n",

It seems like the programs are greyed out though, so IDK what that's supposed to mean.  I haven't been able to reboot the machine after making these changes, but I'm not entirely sure that they were the magic bullet I was hoping for.This morning, I unplugged at a full charge and saw nearly a 10% drop in battery in less than 30 mins.Computer needs to be used for work during the day so IDK when I'll be able to dig deeper.[–]not2rad[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Posting another update here.  I've been focusing on the personal account vs the work/school account that was created on the machine.Was able to do a rundown test with the changes mentioned in the original post (same 4k streaming/settings as before) and wound up with around 6.5 hours of battery life.  Certainly an improvement, especially because the 4k rendering is using consistently 20-25% of the Intel GPU.  I think this works out to avg power draw of about 15W.It seems like the absolute lowest idle power draw I can see in HWInfo is 7-8W.  I don't think it can realistically be any lower while the machine is awake and the screen on.   Can someone else confirm this???In HWInfo, I do have it set not to wake the dGPU, but probably once every minute, I see the power usage jump from 10-30W and info about the nVidia GPU populate in the \"sensors\" screen.  I can't really tell whether this is happening because HWInfo is open, or if the machine would be doing this on its own when sitting idle.... of course this waking of the dGPU raises the average power consumption at idle up to 14-16W.I did also let windows do an energy analysis with powerconfig /energy command.  It didn't really find anything.  The only \"error\" was some generic message about the power management of the GPU being disabled because of a known incompatibility that the internet says is sort of meaningless/inconsequential.One last thing that I've changed while chasing this is the Killer Wifi software.  I was just staring at Resource Monitor with the machine idle and saw really frequent usage of the hard drive.  The Killer Wifi control panel (even though I'd uninstalled it) was constantly writing to a log file.  I fixed this by manually downloading the Intel drivers for the AX211 card and then Uninstalling the Wifi and Bluetooth devices in Device Manager and installing the Intel drivers instead.  I can't say that I saw a big power draw drop after doing this, but the HDD activity is nice and quiet at idle now.Doing some basic math, if the system sits idle consuming 8W and has a 97Whr battery.... the Theoretical maximum battery life is 12 hours.  Realistically the usable capacity of the battery is closer to 90Whr bringing this down to 11hr 15min.  I have no idea how much power having the screen on consumes, but I feel like I've found most of the 'big fish' for this machine for now.... unless someone comes along to show that their machine consumes like 4W at idle.[–]Justagamrhere -1 points0 points1 point 2 months ago(2 children)The first problem is ya bought a Dell laptop.

      "content: hi all, i wanted to share this after figuring it out. i was having very poor battery life while the machine (12700h, 3060, 16gb ram, 512gb nvme, fhd display) was basically just sitting idle or doing extremely light tasks like browsing reddit. did a battery rundown test last night and from 100% charge, screen all they way dim, keyboard backlight on dim, streaming 4k youtube, bt enabled and after 4hr 45mins i stopped the test and had just 21% remaining with an estimated 1hr 10mins left. this machine was bought specifically (with lower res screen) for the best possible battery life, so i was really unhappy with this result. i'd already removed all of the dell bloatware and a lot of the bundled microsoft stuff too, so it's a fairly 'clean' os, but not a fresh install. downloaded hwinfo and discovered that even at idle, thing was drawing 30w, which i know from reading here is about triple what it's supposed to be. realized that there's an nvidia tool that runs in the taskbar that showed 2 applications that were using the gpu... logonui.exe and searchhost.exe. apparently searchhost is related to cortana. i did find a powershell script that was posted that supposedly removes it. the other suggestion that helped was to go into 3d settings in the nvidia control panel and manually \"prefer\" the intel gpu by default and then manually set any games to specifically use the nvidia gpu. this brought the idle wattage in hwinfo down to 8-10w and the battery life estimates shot way up to where they should be, though they have fluctuated around a lot (i think windows is really confused about how to predict that right now). i will try to repeat the rundown test and/or keep an eye on it to see if this change is permanent or if anything else happens.\n",

      "content of comments: (6 children)Wondering if the XPS 15 still overheats as it used to be?I'm not sure what you're referring to (\"used to be\") but I think of it like this:HTH (and g'day).[–]okjeff[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(5 children)Appreciate the detailed insights and information!So to summarise:In short, it might be worth the price (with the black Friday sale - $1470 off) to get the i7 & 16GB, but don't try to go too hard on it, and it's expected that it heats up when it's trying to process.[–]parasymchills 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(4 children)It's somewhat normal to be hot and could overheat when it's trying to perform\"normal\" in the sense that 12th Gen Intel CPUs are designed to safely operate at high temperature but because they do throttle, you cannot achieve the best possible performance compared to if they had the best possible cooling; they won't overheat - throttling prevents that from happening.​The overheating issue could be temporarily fixed by repasting the CPUnot really. It's more the case that with a better paste, the CPU will shed heat better and so allow it to perform at optimal performance for longer (more sustained performance) compared to the factory paste; however, it will still eventually throttle because the cooling system is inadequate for prolonged use.​i9 is generally not suggested unless the need or price makes sensecorrect. For those lucky enough to have deep pockets or a large budget and who just want the highest performing CPU, they'll get the i9; for most people on a budget, it usually makes more sense to get the i7 (you'll get performance close to the i9 but obviously not quite as good). And again, the throttling will tend to even out the performance of both CPUs and so negate some of the i9's performance advantage.​Go 16GB of RAM the 32GB price is unreasonableyep. My 9520 was bought as the i7/16GB/512GB/RTX-3050Ti/UHD+ config and then I swapped one 8GB RAM DIMM with a 32GB DIMM for a total of 40GB. I use a virtual machine so I needed the extra memory. The 32GB DIMM cost about AU$270 at the time whereas Dell was asking for about AU$700.For best performance, it's better to upgrade both DIMMs at the same time. The 16GB config comes with 2 x 8GB DIMMs and you would normally upgrade to 2 x 16GB DIMMs. Most users buy Crucial RAM (it's known to be compatible). Other brands sometimes don't work in the XPS (from what I've read, the cause is not known). Dell uses SK Hynix RAM so that brand would also work but I've never seen any in the local market.I didn't mind the slight performance loss with the uneven memory config I have (which results in single channel mode), but in general I'd recommend most users upgrade with 2 identical DIMMs to get the best memory performance (dual channel mode).Best of luck with your decision.[–]okjeff[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(3 children)Awesome thank you for the speedy reply.I'm actually thinking about the combo of  i7/16GB/512GB/RTX-3050Ti/3.5k screen @ $2728, and yes upgrading to 2x 16GB RAM later on (approx $300 I think).Do you recommend going with the UHD+ screen?And so to recap, in your experience, it hasn't throttled/overheated to a point it shuts down? And in your opinion, the overheating issue isn't really a factory fault as it has been throttling to prevent that to happen?[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)Do you recommend going with the UHD+ screen?I went with the UHD+ screen for a few reasons:If you put a premium on battery life, you would choose the FHD+ screen as it's known to consume less power than the OLED or UHD+ but of course the text is not as sharp with exactly 1/4 as many pixels as the UHD+ screen.​in your experience, it hasn't throttled/overheated to a point it shuts down?no but I normally run the machine in the Power Efficiency power setting and not the High Performance setting. As a result, it's really hard for me to get the machine to throttle from overheating because it's already throttling its power use. If I need more performance, I switch to the middle-ground Balance power setting.I don't like the noise from the fans spinning at high speed so I avoid the High Performance setting. I have used it just to see what it does and it does what it says: the CPU clocks much higher and the fans get pretty loud because they have to work a lot harder to vent the heat out of the chassis.The machine should never get to the point where it shuts down (it would only occur for example if the vents were blocked so the hot air could not escape). It's in Intel's interest to not have their CPUs self-destruct on their customers :)​the overheating issue isn't really a factory fault as it has been throttling to prevent that to happen?I guess that's one way of looking at it. The CPU will throttle to prevent it from getting damaged from excessive heat. It can safely go up to 100 degrees C for a short time but then the throttling kicks in and this forces the internal CPU temperature to drop. When the temperature drops sufficiently, the throttling is eased up and the CPU is allowed to perform at a higher performance again, which of course heats it up again, and so the cycle repeats. This is how it's supposed to work. As you wrote, it's not a fault.[–]okjeff[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(1 child)Thank you for the last-minute information. I did decide to get the UHD+ version for $100 extra to the final price, which would be the exact same config as your XPS15.

I love my XPS to death but when it dies I'm not gonna hesitate to replace it with a MacBook. The switch to ARM couldn't possibly have gone any better. I never would have bet on that but that's how it turned out. I haven't looked in several months but last I checked an M1 Mac in particular is not only the best value on the market but it's literally hundreds of dollars cheaper than comparable XPS. M2s are a bit overpriced and the whole staged chassis transition is far from ideal (XPS shares that problem now too tho tbf), but honestly if you don't need an Nvidia GPU then there's no reason to pick XPS over Mac, other than windows vs macos.Totally different picture than it was ~3 years ago when I bought my XPS and it was a steal compared to what was available, either windows or macs which were still intel-based.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago(3 children)and the whole staged chassis transition is far from ideal (XPS shares that problem now too tho tbf)What do you mean by this?[–]Orion_Scattered 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(2 children)Different sizes being on different chassis, eg the 13\" mbp still the old chassis while the 14\" and 16\" are on the new one.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(1 child)I think the 14\" replaces the 13\", and the 13\" is just kept as a budget option.

They're doing the same thing across most of their product lines.[–]Orion_Scattered 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(0 children)And it sucks.

      "content of comments: (0 children)Theoretically, any generic stylus should work. I tried a couple of active ones (one had a passive tip attachment) for my 9700. All of them were mediocre at best and all were noticeably missaligned by a few mm. I.e. I'd move the pen and the line would appear a few mm to the left or right depending on the pen. Also, it was generally quite annoying to try and use on an upright screen.[–]FrancescaGomes 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(0 children)Hello. I am also interested in this aspect. I bought a pen with a clear silicone tip, because other pens with a simple tip, like the one on my Surface Pro, are not perceived by the screen. It works quite well, for example for drawing, and in some programs it works better than in others. However, it does not have that reactivity that allows me to write perfectly. I can write, but the writing is not as fast as on the Surface: to write with excellent handwriting, I have to take longer. Basically, when I write in cursive and remove the tip from the screen to leave space between the words, the screen does not immediately recognize when I put the pen back. It is fractions of a second, so I can write, but less fluently than on screens that have full compatibility with pens. So, I think the pen is useful, even for corrections on Word, for example; but I think it probably would have been more expensive for the battery to have a screen fully compatible with the pen; on such a large screen (I have the Xps 17) it's really great to write. If you can find more information about it let me know. What Xps do you have?Ps.As for the corner of the screen, I keep it still by inserting something behind it, for example a dictionary, but there are certainly other solutions..\n",

Have you contacted support about this?Hoping this gets resolved soon![–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(0 children)If you are worried about your battery, open a command prompt (Windows-R, type \"cmd\" then press the enter key) and type into it:powercfg /BATTERYREPORTand then press the enter key. This which will create a file that you can open in a web browser. Take a look at what it says and see if the battery's capacity is diminished or if there are problems with it charging, etc. If there are then it's likely that the swelling is a sign of the battery starting to fail.HTH.[–]wecaz1 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago(0 children)I do have issues such as erratic touchpad as pointer cannot be controlled.

      "content of comments: (1 child)What you are seeing is Modern Standby (probably). Modern Standby means that the machine stays network connected and as a result, uses power when the lid is closed.There is no setting to disable Modern Standby. Apparently, this is a deliberate decision by Microsoft to not be able to disable it. (There is a so-called registry hack but it is unreliable).The most common work-around is to change the \"close lid\" setting to make the machine hibernate instead of entering Modern Standby. If this is unsuitable for you, then ignore the rest of this reply.To change the setting, press the Windows key, type \"control panel\" and press enter to open the Control Panel app. Navigate to Hardware and Sound and then to Power Options. In the side panel, click \"Choose what closing the lid does\". In the \"When I close the lid:\" setting, change Sleep to Hibernate. Click Save Changes.More details are in this thread.HTH.[–]MrMoo52 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago(0 children)This is the answer.  My 9710 and 9570 both did the same thing.

If that's the case then you can try hibernating or shutting down. There's no other way to get around the retarded modern standby which is broken on pretty much all Dells.\n",

Is colour-accuracy critical to your work? Do you need sharp text?Personally, I use an LG 38WN95C because it's a great jack of all trades (fast refresh rate, great colours, decent resolution). I shared some thoughts about it here: https://old.reddit.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace/comments/sw6o4e/upgraded_from_crg9_to_38wn95cw_the_extra_vertical/hxkuav6/If you don't care about the refresh rate, have a look at the LG 40WP95C — which trades the gaming chops for a 5k2k resolution. Or check the Lenovo ThinkVision P40W and Dell U4021QW, which use the same panel but add work-oriented niceties like KVMs and RJ45 ports.If your XPS is like mine, it comes with a 130W brick but can charge as long as it's getting at least 65W. So the TB ports on these monitors should be more than enough, since they deliver 90 to 100W.And as for the movable stand, I'd suggest not giving that point too much importance. You'll be better off getting a monitor arm that can be clamped to your desk and will give you way better control.[–]chapulinskies[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago(1 child)Thanks for the suggestion. I should’ve added a budget because that LG is above my limit, considering that I’ve never used a curved monitor before. I ended up going with the dell u3421we. My work is scientific programming and I don’t really game, so I think the specs should be sufficient. Also the price at $620 USD is just right. Thanks for the note on the TB charging. My 9520 also uses a 130W brick and I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to use the monitor charging or if it would limit performance. Do you remember where you found the note that it will charge and won’t limit performance as long as power source is > 65W?[–]TrackballsUberAlles 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago(0 children)Good stuff — Dell's monitors tend be really well-made, too (better than their laptops, that's for sure!). You might find the resolution a bit low for coding (i.e. text won't be super crisp), but at that price point it's hard to nitpick.I can't remember where I found that 65W thing, however.

It just works. Make sure that your NVidia drivers are up to date, and you may also want to update your iGPU drivers using the Intel drivers rather than Dell's.[–]McIsaac 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago(3 children)With the 12th Gen changes to the Thunderbolt implementation the iGPU is being forced as output to monitors. But it should be enough. There have been issues with previous Intel drivers limiting the iGPU to 100mhz which causes stuttering on higher resolutions. \n",

Microsoft is known for its staggered update releases, so they slowly get more and more people on the new update, and can handle any potential complications without affecting too many devices/people. Safeguard hold is just a fancy name to refer to that. See here.I don't know if you can force the update.

      "content: i am using fedora with xps as my primary device for work for few months now and it is a pleasant experience so far. so, thought of sharing my experience on setting it up, so that someone having the same setup find it useful. my laptop is an intel i7 11800h with nvidia rtx 3060 laptop in optimus setup with 4k touch screen. system setting - about almost every device worked out of the box, wifi bluetooth speakers mic fingerprint sensor trackpad gestures (in wayland only) for xorg, i need to install few extensions and companion app in the system. https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4245/gesture-improvements/ only for the nvidia card, i had to enable \"rpm fusion\" repository and install the proprietary drivers. instructions available here https://rpmfusion.org/howto/nvidia but with nvidia proprietary drivers installed, all devices working great, even on wayland. though every device is working, i still had few problems. the important one is the battery backup. it was terrible. the battery drains in 2.5 hrs without doing anything intensive. i installed the gnome extension: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4862/bat_consumption_wattmeter/ to monitor my laptop power draw. it consumed 21w on idle. after reading a lot online, it was clear that the nvidia is not powering down completely when not used. by referring the nvidia driver documentation (https://download.nvidia.com/xfree86/linux-x86_64/515.65.01/readme/optimus.html), i made the below changes to the configuration. ​ added the below udev configuration file to set the device power to auto. file: /etc/udev/rules.d/80-nvidia-pm.rules # enable runtime pm for nvidia vga/3d controller devices on driver bind action==\"bind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030000\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"auto\" action==\"bind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030200\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"auto\" # disable runtime pm for nvidia vga/3d controller devices on driver unbind action==\"unbind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030000\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"on\" action==\"unbind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030200\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"on\" added the below modprobe configuration file to enable dynamic power management. nividia driver documentation says for newer graphics cards, dynamic power management option '0x02' is the default. but for some reason, it wasn't the case for my setup. i had to enable it explicitly. file: /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-pm.conf options nvidia \"nvreg_dynamicpowermanagement=0x02\" disabled nvidia-powerd and enabled nvidia-persistenced service $ systemctl disable nvidia-powerd.service $ systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced.service restarting after the above configuration changes, my nvidia card properly powering down completely when not used and auto turns on when used by any application. now my system idle in 8w. the other issue i faced is not with fedora, but with the zoom client. i use zoom for work and the latest version of zoom support screen sharing in wayland as well. but it is failing to do so when nvidia graphics card is enabled. if i disable the nvidia card completely using udev rules, the zoom works just fine. but if i enabled it (in hybrid mode), the screensharing is not working. the problem could be in pipewire or zoom, not sure. currently it made to switch to x11. in x11 all working great. steam games works good as well.\n",

Or I mean, maybe it works for laptops that are not as power hungry as a Dell XPS 15... I just disabled modern sleep mode, allowed me to set more power control settings as well and just use hibernation.How do I do that? Do I have to disable it from Windows or the BIOS?[–]McIsaac 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)You can use this walkthrough:\n",
      "https://winaero.com/how-to-disable-modern-standby-in-windows-11-and-windows-10/Just make sure you make a backup of your register first within regedit (it's called exporting). And in case you search further, do not use the CSenabled dword version that is also going around. It's screwing up coming back out of hibernation.Within Windows you should also go to your advanced power settings (the one you have through your configuration menu or right click the battery icon in your tray). And there you have the actions for your lid and power buttons. Here you disable sleep and fastboot and enable hibernation (you probably already did so).Reboot and you're doing. You should have more settings now as well in your power management like setting the performance of your wifi in both battery as power connected mode.\n",

      "content: i have a problem with my new xps 9520. it seem that the suspension, even if set to do so in the windows (both the old \"control panel\" and the new setting page) doesn't suspend the laptop when closing the lid, but only turns off the screen. this obviously results in serious laptop overheating, especially when put into a bag it's boiling hot, that concerns me because it can damage it. for now i've solved by changing the behavior to hibernate the computer and not suspend, that solves the risk of frying my new computer, but obviously that is not ideal since it will take more time to wake up and it's annoying. has anyone the same issue? if so how it is solved? i didn't change the installation of windows 11 and this is the stock one (and maybe that is the problem since i should have do that to remove all the bloatware preinstalled...)\n",

Two examples below:https://youtu.be/Kqqd1IMu2e8https://youtu.be/bZpwCpubr_0[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago(1 child)Hey, thank you for your reply. As for the issues, the most prominent one I still have is that the trackpad will randomly click on its own (you can feel and hear the vibrating motors click) and it won't let go until it wants to. It's kind of annoying when doing quick tasks, and I have not found a solution yet, but it isn't killing me. The audio popping I fixed by removing all audio software from my laptop, and the 0.4ghz throttling happened only a single time. Besides that, I have not experienced any other notable issues. The fans don't make a beep unless if I'm doing heavy tasks, it gets warm but I wouldn't say it's anything out of the ordinary for a laptop housing a 12 core processor (I have the 1260P), and battery life is okay for me. I've never owned a laptop with more than 8 hours of battery life, and this is pretty regular to what I am used to. My specs are: intel i7 1260p, 1080p 500nits display non-touch, 32gb of ram, 512gb of storage, silver model. If you have any other questions, I'm more than happy to answer them.[–]nothingspecialva 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago(0 children)Many thanks for the reply. I will keep an eye for these issues. I am confident that with some troubleshooting and dell warranty I will be covered.

You can load the Wi-Fi driver during the out of box experience using the command prompt so you do not need to buy a usbc to Ethernet adapter. I might do a write up a little later.[–]iamkilo 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(15 children)Mine comes this week. I'm slightly concerned, but my assessment was the same as both of yours, in almost all situations, it seemed like software was to blame, not hardware. I also don't mind dealing with support and getting the unit fixed/replaced if it has issues. I shouldn't have to do that, but the promise of an ultraportable with a god-send keyboard (typing experience is *very* important to me), that actually has some real horsepower with the 12th gen Intel, was worth risking a little. I was okay with the poor I/O (which I think is normal given the size compromise you make) and the terrible battery life, but I didn't want to sacrifice performance for it, as that was the whole point.Very interested in your long term experience. Which CPU model did you go with? Curious your thoughts.[–]theamusingname[S] 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago*(14 children)My SKU is 9320 (OLED, i7-1260p, 32GB, 1TB, Graphite). I haven’t had any hardware issues whatsoever and my laptop runs cool and quiet. What I have had is a whole host of software issues. Sometimes the trackpad stops working or the Windows Hello camera stays on after unlocking all requiring a reboot. Luckily this thing reboots fast, and I mean really fast, so I’m usually only down for 15 seconds. The keyboard is absolutely fantastic and I do not mind the capacitive function row at all (it’s a little funky at first). I-O isn’t a problem for me because most of what I do is over the network anyway so the only thing I ever plug into the computer is it’s charger. Performance has been incredible. I can quite comfortably work in a Solidworks assembly of over 300 parts, something I did not expect from integrated graphics. The battery life is abysmal, like 4 hours (at least on my OLED model), but a clean reinstall of Windows appeared to improve it dramatically (7hrs?) - I haven’t had a chance to take it to class after the clean install and properly test the battery life. When you get yours I would absolutely recommend using it for a bit as is before you clean install windows. I will write up a guide here in a little bit because it is a bit funky. I really love my XPS 13 plus, quirks and all. It perfectly fits my use case.[–]iamkilo 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)I have same except 1280p. Thanks for the detailed response. I’ll do as you suggested. I am a developer so running Docker containers, sometimes a Hyper-V VM. Good to hear about Solidworks. That’s a heavy app. I’ll stay in touch and follow your posts. Cheers.[–]DiamondForce2 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(2 children)Glad to hear your experience with solid works. I bought this laptop for uni for engineering, except with the 1260p with 16gb of ram. I was a little worried about CAD not being good with the iGPU, but having thunderbolt 4 I was not concerned knowing I could get an eGPU if I need to in the future.[–]theamusingname[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(1 child)I have exactly the same use case as you. I doubt you will be using it in the industry to work on massive assemblies but it should be fine as is for university work. It runs Pro/E (CREO) and NX well too if you are interested in using either of those programs. Edit: the 16gb of ram might be a little rough but again probably fine for university work.[–]DiamondForce2 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)I was originally considering the 32gb model, but after hearing from people in the industry the general consensus was that 16gb would be adequate for university level assemblies. I’m not too concerned, as if I need to in the future I’ll build a more powerful desktop since my current desktop is getting outdated anyways.[–]osmoen 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(3 children)Interesting information regarding the restart time. My 1280P, 32GB, 2TB, FHD+ takes a comfortable 60+ seconds from I hit the restart button until I'm signed back in using Hello. Maybe a concern I need to bring to support.[–]theamusingname[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(2 children)It might be a good idea. I also have absolutely 0 startup apps (aside from power toys and 1Password) and do not run a lot of applications all at once - when I restart windows usually only needs to shut down 2 applications. I could time my restart speed if you would like, in actuality it could be significantly longer, it just never felt so long that I ever noticed.[–]upk27 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(1 child)how long does your battery last?[–]theamusingname[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)Not very… 6hrs on a good day. It was much improved after a reinstall of Windows 11, but has gotten worse since I downgraded to Windows 10. It’s a trade off, the raw CPU power is worth it for me, but I might have gone FHD IPS if I could do it again. Then again, the OLED is beautiful…[–]iamkilo 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(5 children)Update. Mine arrived today. I was able to go through the initial setup sequence, but pretty much shortly after I made it to the desktop, it started to overheat (to the levels where I would say you could probably sue and have a case) and became unusable. I was never even able to launch Dell's app to update BIOS or drivers. Now when I start it up, I get to the desktop and as soon as I start to click anything, instant overheat and hard lock. Never recovers.So it looks like I'll be clean-installing unless I want to deal with support hell. They also sent me the white, not graphite, I don't really care that much, but ticked me off nonetheless.I've got a lot of stuff going on this week and not sure I'll get around to it, but will report back my experience once I do.[–]theamusingname[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(4 children)I’ll put it on my todo list for tomorrow to detail how I did my clean install. I’ll make sure to send you a link personally. That sounds like a truly terrible first impression…[–]iamkilo 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(3 children)I think I've gathered enough online to make an attempt. Basically do the Windows media creation tool, then download the Intel Rapid Storage drivers and put those on the same thumb drive (extracted). If I've missed something critical, no worries, not like it can be any more jacked than it currently is, ha :)It looks amazing though. That display looks beautiful for all 9 seconds I get to use it ;)[–]theamusingname[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(2 children)Download the Wi-Fi drivers and name the exe something you will remember. Throw it on the root of your install flash drive. After you install windows and enter the out of box experience windows will not let you proceed until you connect to Wi-Fi, but you will not have Wi-Fi drivers. Open the command prompt (Shift+F10) and run the exe you stored on the drive. Also, when you reformat I would only reformat the OS partition (the largest one) leaving all the recovery stuff.[–]iamkilo 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(1 child)Success! I am logged into my notebook successfully. Fully patched up. The only thing I did differently was killed all the other partitions, I like to live dangerously #yolo.Thanks for the help kind stranger. I'll reach out if I experience anything crazy I think you should watch out for.[–]crypto_knight1 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago(1 child)What an embarrassment. I just got this laptop 2 months ago and the power brick already died. I also started noticing problems with playback on videos and overall performance. Now I come to find out they have been recalled by Dell. This is pathetic, I should not have to lift a finger to fix a laptop that can be close to $2k, it should just fuc@#$ work out of the box. There are no excuses here from Dell.[–]theamusingname[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)I agree with you, the last laptop I had was a MacBook I had used for 8 years. That thing had been through the wringer and just keep on working. I needed to change over to a windows machine now though for university because Apple removed Bootcamp. My experience so far has been largely pretty positive but it seems like a trend that after a couple months people start noticing serious issues (I’ve only had mine for a week). A clean windows reinstall isn’t very difficult but it is absolutely effort that should not have to be put in. I would also like to add that there has been NO OFFICIAL MENTION of a recall of any sort. It seems like a hastily thrown together cover-up to me.[–]AusGeno 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(2 children)I can deal with bad battery life and weird intermittent system freezes but I cant get over how shit this keyboard is.

      "content: main review: i wanted to love the 9315 but unfortunately i am sending it back. i really do love the design and speakers etc. the speakers are really an upgrade from the 9310. the chassis is incredibly solid for how thin the unit is. the keyboard is also ok, however, it hass much worse travel than my samsung ativbook 12.2 which i will make comparisons to throughout this review as it is a similar subnotebook, and both are about the same thickness. the hinge felt extremely solid. i like how the power button has a different tactile feel from the other buttons. it is also recessed which should prevent accidental key presses when folks are reaching for delete. dell did a nice job with modern standby power draw on this machine. ​ i thought that with the ultra low wattage cpu, the fan would be hardly ever on and i would get great battery life. when i first saw this online, it reminded me of my old ativbook 12.2 from sansung which was an awesome device for its time. it stopped reminding me of the ativbook as soon as i started using it. out of the box, the fan in mine made a rattling noise which got louder when the unit is moved or tilted. i could have gotten my fan replaced but had other concerns. the fan curve is totally mysterious to me. it runs at a low speed even when the cpu is at 80 degrees f. when i ran a compile job on all cores, it ran at a max cpu temp of about 122 to 130 degrees f with the fan running loud. an always or almost always running fan won't be good for battery life. maybe they run the fan so much to keep skin temps under control, but i prefer silent running and longer battery. if we are going to have a fan, why not better performance that comes with fans; notebookcheck says this runs half the speed of the i5 p chip in the plus. i would be much more accepting of this speed reduction if this unit was fanless. the ativbook was fanless, and performed well for a machine without a fan for its time. i was hoping the xps fan would only run when i really pushed it and also spread its wings a little bit with the headroom of the fan to give me good performance. instead, we got the disadvantages of both the fanless and fan machines in this design. my old 9310 kept its fan off until a much higher temp was reached and ran passively almost all the time which was one reason i loved it. if you want to run linux, the webcam requires a proprietary kernel driver and software that isn't in most linux distros so unless you run dell's modified ubuntu image, getting the camera working is a nightmare if you dual boot or run linux exclusively. i don't know much about windows, however, from what i read, it seems like folks are having stability issues with the drivers on that operating system as well. when pushing on the display of the 9315 lightly next to the camera (i do this to open the lid), the unit makes a creaking/cracking noise. the old 9310 had metal reinforcement in front of the display which held it firmly in place. i wish i had kept my 9310 as it was rock solid. based on what i am hearing about the 9320 and my experience with the 9315, it really seems like dell wrecked a good thing with these new units. there is so much out there with similar specs for less money that will perform better, which i saw from benchmarks that had come out after i ordered my unit. i went for the xps because i was hoping for the build, reliability, and linux support that xps is known for, even though i knew there were other machines in this class with more performance. the main theme i have noticed this year for better performance seems to be ryzen. the asus s13 is in this same class and gets great ratings although i have never seen one. i had a friend with a hp devone and that really impressed me; that might be a possibility if you want rock solid linux support as it runs with the mainline kernel just fine according to my friend (i will likely go this route). the devone is slightly thicker, however, you get the nifty trackpoint, great travel keyboard, and all sorts of ports, as well as great cooling. things that i originally looked over due to my experience of reliability, and good linux mainline support with xps in the past: dell claims they removed the headphone jack from the 9315 to meet design goals. the ativbook 12.2 was thinner then the 9315 and had two usb a, mini hdmi, power, and headphone. i know dell wants a certain look with these machines that probably doesn't include usb a ports, however, one more usb c and micro sd reader would have been great additions to the 9315. if you are using headphones and charging, you are out of ports. asus included the headphone jack and an extra usb c on their s13 for a total of three and it is a similar thickness. the asus and ativbook don't have soldered sds and the 9315 does. i knew about these disadvantages when i bought the xps, however, i was willing to look past them due to my positive experiences with linux support, build quality, and reliability of previous xps units; now they just add to the other disadvantages. improvements i'd like to see next year: i get that this isn't supposed to be the ultra fast machine for developers. if we are going to keep this chassis next year with minimal ports and the soldered ssd, lets get rid of that fan and add a 60 or 70wh battery so its an all day extremely portable machine. this would make the soldered ssd, and few ports worthwhile. i could see myself owning the machine i just described, as well as a slightly thicker machine for my heavy compiling jobs. dell innovated on the outside of the xps 13+ with the touchbar and new keyboard, which although i think is pretty neat, i won't buy because i am a developer and like to be able to strike the fn keys by touch when using my editor. maybe next year, they can focus the innovation effort on the inside and determine a way to cool the successor to the 9315 ultra thin model without a fan. i'd also like to see dell moving back to a place where there machines are supported by the mainline linux kernel, as opposed to needing proprietary linux images. there has been great work with xps fingerprint readers now being supported, however, the lack of support for the web camera in these latest models is a backslide. hp releasing the devone provides serious linux competition from another main manufacture of laptops, and dell will need to step up their game to compete.\n",

      "content of comments: (4 children)The biggest differences I see are size and processor. Do you want a bigger/heavier laptop, or is small and ultra portable better for you? That’s strictly personal preference, so any feedback that you get from anyone else saying you should go one way or the other is them simply telling you their personal preference. When I had an XPS I went 13” because I wanted it to double as a tablet, and it was still too big/heavy for that task. I’m back on a 16” MBP and an iPad. But, that’s simply my personal preference.The processor on the 15” is a generation older, so personally I’d prefer the newer chip.In my experience, from when I has my XPS, go with a lower resolution display. The higher resolution EATS battery, and the visual difference on that small of a display is negligible.[–]KingJoey___[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(3 children)This was insightful, Are you not concerned about the integrated ram? If anything goes wrong the laptop is done.The 15 has an older gen processor but its ranked higher than the 13's.\n",
      "I could always get and external hard drive or is the hit on battery life too extreme?The 13 also has ddr5 which is amazing but im not sure how big of difference that would be for laptop use since i still have a primary desktop and just need my laptop for work/school.Sorry at this point im just thinking out loud, you gave me a lot of good information, the 15 is discounted $700 right now and thats the market price for the 13.\n",
      "I am in nursing school and im not sure how often I can plug in my laptop throughout the day yet.[–]PeterDTown 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(2 children)To be perfectly honest, I would GUESS that you won’t notice the performance difference between the two. Form factor (size) and battery life are probably the most important considerations.[–]KingJoey___[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(1 child)Do you happen to know how big of a difference the battery life is between the two? The size doesn't bother me too much since it will only be in my backpack or on a desk.[–]PeterDTown 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(0 children)I do not. Here’s another way to look at it though, I only enjoyed 13” because I was either plugged into an external monitor or I was lying in bed with it in tablet mode. Personally, I’d find 13” annoying to work on, even for taking notes, as I like a big screen. But my external monitors are a 34” ultrawide at home and a 40” ultrawide at the office, so I enjoy as much screen real estate as possible. Working on a 13” screen sounds like a nightmare to me.[–]poopshipdestroyer4 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(4 children)I just got an xps 15 a I7 12th gen with an oled. So far it's been pretty great. Definitely much heavier than my last laptops.[–]erhue 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(3 children)Why are they so heavy?[–]poopshipdestroyer4 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(2 children)They are made of metal.[–]erhue 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(1 child)I read around a little bit. Maybe also has to do with the (relatively) large batteries and heatsinks/cooling chambers that are a necessity with the thin design?Laptops like the LG gram are also made out of metal, but instead lighter even than plastic ones.[–]poopshipdestroyer4 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)Yes, the components in the xps are superior.  I was actually looking at a gram 2-1 and xps 15. The gram is amazingly light but feels a little bit on the cheap side with the manganese construction. It has a ton of flex, I was scarred it wasn't going to hold up with the amount of travel I do. I ended up with the xps 15, it's a great laptop but it on way heavier than anything I have owned before. I actually got the lg gram view+ protable screen to pair with the xps because of how portable it is. The manganese backing on the view+ was instantly scratched when placed in my bag with the xps after my first trip.[–]nyjohn14 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago(0 children)So I have a XPS 17 and a 13in galaxy book 2 360, I use both differently, my galaxy book I take with me to the kitchen and to the living room and to my bed. The XPS however is grounded into my desk (since its too large and heavy to carry around) for whenever I need work done since it has a dedicated gpu, I would go with the 15in since it has the gpu, bigger and better display and is cheaper, but thats just me.\n",

In my experience, the 6gb and more CUDA cores of the 3060 do matter for GPU effects in Premiere and Resolve. In all, I favor Dell as they have more onsite warranty options (at least in US; I noticed you quote euro prices). Dont worry too much about buying from dell or razer RAM or storage, those are easy to source yourself used or new (here in reddit for instance). I would say priority are a) screen that you like to use for 8-10 hours a day for the next 3 years; 2) reputable warranty service in case something breaks down the road; 3) decent CPU or GPU (not the latest, just decent). between 12th gen CPU and 3050Ti and 11th gen CPU and 3060 or better, I take the 11th with the 3060.\n",

      "content of comments: (2 children)Personally, I always pull for raw power over battery life. I have the 9710 i9 with rtx 3060 and I get about 5ish hrs screen on time, if I'm doing light work. Any creative work, and that'll drain very fast. Also, I'd recommend at least 32 Gb, if not 64. I know that sounds crazy, but I've already maxed out the ram using davinci resolve when manipulating title text files (they must've been really messed up, given I can edit 4k footage without issue). Adobe is likely better optimized overall than the free version of davinci 😅I always have a \"light\" charger with me though. I can charge the 9710 with just an Anker 45 watt charger, and it's more than sufficient during light work (web browsing, word, PowerPoint, light programs, etc). Allows me to still pack light, and use the charging brick when doing video work. It's still possible to do creative work without the big power brick, but I like using it so that I'm not throttled by performance, as I'm convinced the computer doesn't run on max settings on battery or slow charging.Also, yes, get the 17 inch. You won't regret the extra real estate, especially if you (or your friend) is used to standard 15 inch laptops.[–]dgpap[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(1 child)Thanks for the reply!

If you were trying to purely \"help people\", there was no need to say \"content designed purely so the video can be monetized\". That is rude, hurtful, and untrue.When you are doing a labor of love, like I am. Spending hours creating these videos,  you want as many people to watch them. Plus, if you have watched my channel for a while, you will notice that I often give people the conclusions to the video at the front, because I value their time.

I mean its good, but wonder if it was just an anomaly with his unit. Like he said in the video there might be something else going on[–]Sharkfacedsnake 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(2 children)Its ok. Like its enough. My brother has a MBP M1 pro 14 inch. It has much better battery life. But it is not really necessary. I got my laptop recently so i have been downloading and testing it with games and blender renders which would not usually be my normal usage at all. But i think i am getting 7 hrs until 0%. But how often am i away from a charger for more than 7 hours? Almost never. A 7 or 10 hour battery life might not really make a difference in many peoples workflows/usage. I have been running it a lot of the time at 100% brightness with lots of applications open, with just a browser open you might get further.[–]LeoWitt 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(1 child)Oh that's pretty good. I agree unless I'm traveling 7 hours is plenty. Which screen option did you get?[–]Sharkfacedsnake 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)1920x1200 FHD touchscreen. It is very sharp and bright. Even compared to the MBP M1 14 inch. I was worried mine would look bad or blurry but at 13 inches it is great. But the mac does get brighter and is 120 fps.\n",

But also a laptop that was pleasent to use even when I wasn't working or gaming, with decent battery life, solid support, and good build quality. I still don't have the eGPU but, let me tell you, the build quality is excellent, the 3.5k OLED screen is excellent, and it's not very loud under a large load. Also, the speakers are probably better than any gaming laptop on the market.I'm gonna get a beefy cooling pad and use the 4 PCIe lanes that the thunderbolt ports have for an eGPU in a few months.

      "Older or eSports titles will be more likely to work at 4k. Newer titles will almost definitely need you to turn the resolution down to 1080p, or at very least turn graphics options down a fair bit (prob medium/low)If it were me, I'd probably keep games at 1080p and have higher fancier graphics settings, rather than lower graphics settings but more pixels.Heat wise, CPU is the only real issue but again should be fine. As long as it maxes out around 90°C you shouldn't have issues.If you notice it's a bit hotter than 90, you can buy little cooling stands for laptops with in-built fans, the XPS' metal casing should help make those cooling fans a bit more effective too.[–]kelvin_bot 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago(2 children)I'm a bot that converts temperature between two units humans can understand, then convert it to Kelvin for bots and physicists to understand[–]Lakophen 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago(1 child)Good bot[–]B0tRank 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)Thank you, Lakophen, for voting on kelvin_bot.This bot wants to find the best and worst bots on Reddit.

      "content of comments: (2 children)Hi best of luck with your decision. I have the xps15 and my wife has xps17 and they are great machines. If you aren’t pushing them with games you should have any issue with thermals or noise since you aren’t killing the CPU.I’d say pick the one or ones you are interested in and order them and ensure you have a return policy that allows you to return for free (if you are in the fence). For my xps15 I bought a “b stock” where it had a little ding on the back and got a couple hundred knocked off, just a little tip to save a couple bucks. Again, best of luck. I had an xps13 around 8 yrs ago and loved it and it worked great until I sold it for the xps15 simply because for my eyes I wanted a 15. In my experience if you enjoy the machine when you get it, it will run for a long time. It’s very high quality.[–]GenocidalGenie 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(1 child)Any tips on how to get a \"b stock\" laptop?

In buying an ultrabook system, my recommendation is don't overbuy.  If you can live with 16GB of RAM, don't buy 32GB.  If you don't do gaming, go with the Intel GPU.  In most cases the i5 CPU will be plenty fast enough.  The lower end you can live with, the less heat you will generate and the longer the battery and the system will live.  I am using an i5, 8GB of RAM,  Intel GPU running Windows 10, and I can still run WSL and run one or two Linux VMs with VMware.  If I was doing this for a living or for college, I would go with 16GB of RAM, but as I do it for fun, and I travel a lot, price and weight were my major factors going with the 9305.\n",

      "content of comments: (1 child)So for anybody wondering, and for future people experiencing this issue, I have not been able to resolve this problem. Instead, I put a different VBIOS on it which is 50-55w, up from the 45w of the original. After flashing to this new vBIOS, I have experienced no issues, so I can confidently recommend doing so. The only \"issue\" I have experienced, which I believe is standard when switching vbios, is that no programs will read the gpu wattage draw. But, that doesn't matter. I know it is working because my clocks have gone from 1150Mhz to 1600Mhz. My temps have only increased by about 5c on GPU core, and I am making the assumption that the VRM can handle this appropriately, as its not like I jumped to a 70w vbios. As a result of the ~40% increase in clock speeds, my framerates have increased by at least 35%, which has made some previously sub-60fps games perform at well over 60fps. The performance gain was big enough that it felt as if I did a GPU upgrade. It is possible that I caused this entire problem myself, as I literally never even booted into the OS when receiving this laptop, and instead installed Win10 Enterprise right away, as this is what I need for work. It is very likely that I would have not experienced this issue if I had left it in its original configuration. However, I should have been able to fix the issue when I used all the official dell drivers and utilities as a troubleshooting step. This laptop only ships with Win11, not Win10, so it is possible that the hardware was never intended to officially work with Win10.​This is the vBIOS I used -https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/241619/241619[–]noenic33 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago*(0 children)Hi , I have a 9510 I can reach 45w from time to time, but after about 5 minutes of play, there is a power limit that blocks the card at 20w. So I go from 70fps on BeamNG to 20 and it drives me crazy. A new BIOS will be more efficient? I don't know if removing the wattage reading won't break something else or disturb the battery life. Any other issue with this bios mod ?​EDIT: You should stay on Windows 11, 12th gen Intel uses P cores and E cores that are only managed with windows 11,I think[–]Reaper31292 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(1 child)This is a silly question, but are you sure you had the computer on Dell's performance power plan? That's the only one that will give you 45w on the GPU. Cool and Quiet will both cap you around about 30W.  Even so, I'm still interested in flashing the bios to the one you mentioned in a comment, because those are significant gains. Is that easy to do?[–]imlose444[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)Yes, it takes 5 mins. Download nvflash and look at a guide, you'll be done in 5 mins too. I'm actually gettkng like 1700mhz with it.\n",

      "content: i have the new 9520, i7 12700h, 3050ti. it works great for the most part, but its kind of killing me that i can't get above like 1150mhz on a 3050ti, a gpu which can run close to double that. this limitation is caused by the fact that my gpu will not draw more than 35w. i have tried everything, but cannot figure this out. according to the specs on dell's website, it should be able to hit 45w, which would dramatically increase my core clock, and therefor framerates. does anyone have any ideas?\n",

My XPS laptop came with a overheating and audio issue. When I contacted 'Premium Support' as well, an engineer came down to fix my issue, where they replaced the motherboard. However, the engineer was inexperienced and cracked (I don't even know how dude) the back cover of my laptop at the part which one of the screw lies as he faced troubles unscrewing the screws. Contacted Dell again and they send the same engineer down to replace the back cover, even though they promised to send another experienced engineer. After the service, the engineer told me that the screw was stuck which he had to 'forcefully' removed it to replace the back cover, which damaged the internals and the screw cannot be screwed in now (even though he is the one who screwed it in during the previous onsite service). However, the engineer promised me that its a 'minor part' according to him and that the back cover is closed securely, which only to cause an issue when I turn the laptop on. The back cover popped open and buzzle noise when be heard coming from the laptop. Diagnostic test was ran by the laptop automatically and it detected failure in system fan. Moreover, the touchpad became loose and unreactive. After reporting to Dell, they refuse to exchange my laptop.

What annoys me the most is that a friend of mine bought the exact same configuration at the same time as me has literally none of these problems.​First, there is a strong green tint on the OLED screen when the colors are dark like rgb(3,3,3), it should be almost black but you can see very well that the screen is green. I know that green tint is common on oled screen, my Iphone has it. except that to see it on my Iphone you have to look for it, I never notice it. On the xps it's just impossible not to notice it, I feel like it's gotten worse over time. look at these two pictures, rgb(3,3,3) and basic content on netflix.​Then, the sound of this computer is great but it's only due to the software improvement of the Maxxaudio wave, which creates a huge latency in the sound and a lot of weird bugs with the content, like 2 seconds of latency between the moment you press the play button and the content starts. This does not happen when I disable the enable audio enhancement option.Then, in only 1 year the battery has lost 25% of its maximum capacity with only 200 cycles.When I told a technician on whatsapp about these problems, he told me that everything was normal but I think he didn't want to help me at all. How can I get access to this premium support option, I can never talk to a competent person.I'm not sure how to get access to this premium support option, I never get to talk to the right people. it was a few months ago, now that I finally have the time to deal with it. the waranty ends in august, I'm hoping to get a battery and screen replacement and that the technician will fix this audio problem.Do you think I have a chance of getting it done?​EDIT: I had and have sometimes trackpad issues but nothing realy serious only temporary.[–]Wheels35[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(6 children)The only way I got in touch with the premium support people is through the chat on dells website. It only takes a day or so to hear back on their website, and once the service order is started, it can go past the warranty date because you started a claim before it ended.[–]noenic33 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(5 children)Thanks, Hope they will understand, because they only use dell’s hardware scan to find issues, and on my laptop it comes out with no issues, but i can tell there is an issue[–]Wheels35[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(4 children)Are you US based? I know on the site, if I go to support, then click on the Service Tag ( or enter it if it doesn't auto pull up ) and on that new page I click \"Contact Us\" on the right hand side foyout and then \"Contact Technical Support\" I go through the channels there.Obviously my issue wouldnt be discovered with a hardware diagnostic either so I told them that, they had me send pictures the first time, and I was clear with the pictures they can't see what was going wrong easily, and they finally just said \"okay\"[–]noenic33 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(3 children)I just got out of a reporting session with a remote technician. So with remote screen sharing.I showed him the images of the screen defects, then my sound problems and lastly the degradation of the battery too pronounced for a 10 month old computer.He took everything into account, he took note of the fact that the screen had a default and told me that he will organize an intervention of a technician, he explained that the lithium ion batteries degrade and that it was normal but that he made me a commercial gesture and went to include it in the repair.I have not yet received a confirmation of intervention by email, but for the moment I trust the technician and I hope to receive it later.I guess ima send updates on this thread about the repair for an other opinion about this, note that I wont have a full laptop replacement, but still there is a chance parts will be late to arrive.​EDIT : Am in france in the middle of the  countryside.EDIT 2: If you want to contact the customer service and you already know the problem ask directly to speak to a technician about a replacement part, it will save you a lot of time in agent transfer[–]Wheels35[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(2 children)I wonder how different it is here vs over in Europe. We have very different laws when it comes to warranties, and I wonder if thats why I kept getting thrown around all over the place.Hopefully yours gets all taken care of. Today they offered me a brand new 9520, so hopefully a new one has no faults.[–]noenic33 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)Oh. That’s nice, if it doesn’t have any issues you made a deal ! sort of.\n",

      "So, the technician has just left, he has replaced the screen and the battery.He came with his ifixit kit and changed both parts without any problem. He did all the tests and after rechecking the defect visible on the previous screen I see that they are no longer visible on the new one. at least from what I see, but I still see green tint on the upper part of the screen but much less pronounced than the old one, anyway all OLED screens will have this kind of default. at least I will see it less in my content.The battery for the moment I know nothing about it we will see if it holds.But it went a little too well, I pointed out to the technician that he forgot a protective film on the underside of the screen, he told me he would remove it later. In the end he left without removing it, No worries, I'll remove it myself.oh well, great, I had to disassemble everything to disconnect the screen cables because it went over the film.It's not a big deal, I also had my ifixit kit but for someone who doesn't have the ability to do it, it would have been very annoying.For my audio problems he told me to reinstall the latest sound drivers (as if I hadn't already tried). Of course it didn't change anything.Does every dell XPS 95*0 owner have sound latency problems? With the default drivers and audioMaxx Waves?\n",

      "content: if this isn't appropriate, please let me know and i will delete, but this details an ongoing issue/saga i'm currently having with dell premium support. i know some of it might be self-inflicted and i am aware. extremely tl;dr multiple 'misinformation', even attempted deceit and still no replacement or repaired product over 45 days so, after a long deliberation of what laptop to buy, i settled on the arctic white xps 9510 3050ti - touch 16gb/1tb from best by, knowing there could be some issues with a trackpad, but i was willing to deal with the laptop lottery if it meant that i can get most, if not all of the other features i wanted. fastforward about a month after i purchased the laptop and the top left corner of the trackpad was raising so much so, that it was sitting above the palm rest and actually jabbing into my palm. i submitted the issue and very quickly got a response and was asked to provide pictures, which i gladly did and they created a work order, and said everything would be good for in-home repair the next week. ten minutes later i received an email about the part being backordered an no availability at this time, this is where the beginning of the saga began. i emailed immediately and they replied with 'no its just because the shipping department is closed for the night, its not back ordered and you will be fine tomorrow'. come the next day, and i received an email from a different technician say the part was backorder, no eta, and to just 'wait it out'. i immediately replied stating what the previous tech said, and that the laptop is practically unusable because of the sharp corner of the trackpad. they then stated that the technician miscommunicated, and there was nothing he could do. i followed up with a different technician every day for a week, with no eta early than 45 days out from the date i had submitted the issue. i kept pressing for an update or at least a replacement of any kind, and they said come the following monday if there is no eta still, they would escalate to the exchange team. come that monday, i received an email that the part i had order was shipped for delivery and should arrive at the technician the following day. (of course it was suddenly available) technician arrives, he was a wonderful person, and sat down and disassembled the laptop in about 20 minutes, until he got to the motherboard where he found out a handful of the screws were stripped and he was worried that if he got them out he would make them worse. so he escalated to a send in repair. after about a week of waiting i get the box and send it into the service center. about 3 days later i received the laptop, and the palmrest was seemingly replaced as it had a plastic cover on it. i flip the laptop over, install my upgraded ram, and when installing it, i now notice, not only the previous stripped screws were still installed, but all of the screws holding the battery in are also now stripped. no big deal in the end to me. i flipped the laptop back over, removed the plastic cover, and to no surprise, the track pad was almost exactly as i had sent it in, raised above the palm rest. it seems like they potentially tried to push the trackpad down, or whatever replacement part was also defective. so i immediately hopped back on support and reported it again. this time they escalated it to the exchange team almost immediately. the exchange team reached back out to me with a decently specc'd system, for all intents and purposes, it was an upgrade. 32gb vs the 16 and a 2tb vs the 1tb in my original spec, but i had already upgraded those myself on my previous system, so it wasn't a value to me, but the issue was it wasn't in white. sure, this is a bit of a first world problem, but i specifically sought out and bought a white one because that is the one i wanted, so i replied stating 'i have a white one and this was a black one' and 24hours later i got an email stating 'the replacement we have is silver exterior with blank interior' do you accept? i replied with my obvious frustration, especially since all of this has built up for so long at this point, and stating those two upgrades are unnecessary for me, i would even take a downgrade to a 512gb white one if they could just get me that model. no response for the rest of the day, and then a response on monday stating that the white one i saw was no longer available, that the one they were offering me already has upgraded memory and ram so i wouldn't need to use mine that i bought separately. i replied saying, if i were to take this model, i would like to talk about having a new warranty instead of the month i've lost dealing with this already, and get it overnighted to me since that is what the support rep said they could do. no response for two days, until i push for some sort of update. finally get a response saying that the white one is still unavailable(didnt ask but okay at least they are 'trying'), and that if i wanted to do warranty transfers i would have to open a separate support ticket????, and that my case is now marked as priority response, but that the previous rep 'miscommunicated on the ability to overnight' i said fine i'll take the offered one and deal with the warranty stuff myself, but this is now at least the second 'miscommunication' during this whole process. come three hours later i get a response saying that the 'originally offered model was no longer available to be processed' and i was offered two different models. turns out, the day there was no response, the unit wasn't held for my replacement and was sold. so, the two new models i was being offered was an arctic white unit or a black interior, 3050(not ti) 1200p non touch model as my two options. i then realized that the arctic white one they were offering me was the 'scratch and dent' model i had seen on their refurb site earlier in the day, since it was no longer listed. obviously, neither of these two models are valid replacements at this point, especially since it was a significant downgrade (over $500 cheaper) for the black unit, and the white one was scratch and dent. i pushed back a bit and asked if i can escalate it. i was told that it will take up to 48 to confirm 'escalation availability' and then if i could escalate it to their manager then i would need to schedule out time to have the meeting. she also asked that i wait another 3-5 business days to see if they can 'find' a replacement one that fits all the requirements, either a white one or a black one with the upgraded specs, since she said that's what her manager would suggest anyways.. this is currently where i'm sitting at with them and will update with more information as i get it. again, if this is no appropriate for this sub, please let me know and i will pull it down ​ update: 6/20 - they have offered me the same white one they offered before, that was potentially from their scratch and dent. i pushed back to see if they can provide me any more information about the device, like why it was a refurb, what happens if i receive it and it still has issues, and all that. since this is a spec for spec ( except for the fact it has win 10??? which i didnt even think these had an option to come with it ), replacement, they won't approve a refund or a 'new' model until they attempt to send this one out. ​ update: 6/23 - received the white replacement. its actually in worse trackpad shape then before. the whole left side of the trackpad is above the palmrest instead of just the top left corner. so lets see what happens now ​ update: 6/24 - hopefully the last update in the saga. received a call from the corporate escalations team in regards to this. he noted all of my chat logs and all of my email interactions and has offered to give me a 9520 instead. interestingly enough, he noted the white ones currently are no longer being produced (delay or otherwise he wouldnt tell me) unfortunately he said it will take a couple weeks to get. this isnt what i was even asking for, i just wanted a working 9510 but i am grateful. i'm still wishy washy about buying future models from dell, but in the end they did make this one right in the long run. hopefully this new model comes in and has no issues. ill update as needed going forward.\n",

I've had good results with this app finding, and fixing, issues.[–]realeggnoodle[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Will give it a try! thanks[–]mijcar 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(3 children)This happened to me last Friday:Xfinity came over to my house and to work on a junction box in my backyard.  I immediately turned off my wife's computer because she had a Zoom class to teach in the next few days and I didn't want her computer to be vulnerable.  After two hours, the workman came to my door and said that a cable had gone back downstream from my house.  My house was okay, however.When I turned on my wife's computer, she had no internet at all - neither ethernet nor wireless.  On my ethernet computer, I had not issues.I immediately started searching for solutions based on the idea that the problem had to be internal to her system:  New drivers, system check, MS repair bot -- nothing worked.  CCleaner (which is occasionally useful) find items that should be repaired, but nothing fixed the issue.  I tried going back a week.  That didn't work, so now my attention was external to the system.I turned on two laptops:  no wireless!  I checked my iphones.  They had a wireless connection to the same network.  WTF!!Finally, I called DELL.  House desktops are Dell 8940's.  Laptops are old Dell's.  Could this somehow be a Dell issue?  The technician spend two hours on the phone with me as we tried different fixes, including the BIOS.  Nothing worked.  I used the iphone to create a hotspot, and that allowed his to get onto the computer, and seemed to shoot down the notion that the wireless didn't work.That suggester either the modem or the router.  I reset the modem and router.  The problem persisted.The technician finally concluded (and I agree) that the problem had to be in my wife's computer.  We set up an appointment for the following week to replace the board and the wireless card.---The next day, I revisited the problem.  What if the problem was mechanical, but not in the XPS?  What if it were in either the modem or the router?  But wait: how could other peripheral equipment have no problem either with the ethernet or the router?Still, the ways of technology are mysterious indeed.So, I reset the router way to Day 1.  Same identity, same password,  If that didn't work, I'd try it again with a new identity, new password.And everything worked!  Starting with my wife's computer.  That Saturday, I checked the laptops and my iPhones and found that I had to reconnect to the network, but they worked perfectly ever since.Conclusion:  Something in the router.  Because of the timing, I assumed it was an electrical shock to the router caused by the work on the junction box in my yard.  I have no real proof, but that is my gut take on this.Hope all this proves helpful.[–]realeggnoodle[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(2 children)Thanks for the info! From what I’ve read you had issues with the router, unfortunately my issue is the computer because the wi-fi card does not detect any available connections. Windows says “Wi-fi is turned off”. I’ve read online that the AX500 has a lot of issues. I am out of warranty and when contacting Dell they force me to pay $100 before they will do any real talking with me which sucks.[–]mijcar 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago*(1 child)I should have made my post longer  :-)I had issues.  My computer couldn't connect with the ethernet, either, and MS kept reporting that is couldn't correct the settings.  Everything pointed to the computer, enough to convince the Dell agent that the problem was the hardware (and they hate that because the machine was under full warranty and they'd have to pay for onsite repairs).My temporary solution (and the one I recommend) is go buy a 20 dollar WLAN adaptor dongle from Office Depot.  It can always be useful even after your AX500 is fixed; and their range and speed is much better than whatever you have in your computer.  I did this ages ago for a laptop that had a wi-fi adaptor that was not repairable.My exploratory suggestion is reset modem and router to factory settings.  It should be easy, maybe even one-click mechanically if you can't access it from the browser (which you should try first).  See if you can find the latest app online for communicating with your router.However, if your machine is a laptop, then, yes, it will be much more of a pain.  Accessing the wlan on some Dell laptops is a genuine pain and occasionally impossible.  Dell does offer a 90 day out-of-warranty machine coverage that provides full on-site warranty for non-accidental repairs.  Two years ago, it cost just under $100.  If you could get your computer to work and sign in to Dell, then you can get the warranty in case the fix doesn't persist.  The warranty kicked in 30 days after purchase.I wish I could be of more help.[–]realeggnoodle[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Yeah, I do have a usb wi-fi dongle that I am using right now, just a little inconvenient that I have to use that. Thanks for the information though, I’ll look into that 90 day warranty. Appreciate the reply![–]JustaTexaninBoston 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(1 child)Is it possible for you to get a new Wi-Fi card? If it won’t load in the BIOS, there’s something physically wrong with your current one. It may just be a loose connection as well.I swapped mine out for an Intel card to improve reliability and soon will upgrade it to a Wi-Fi 6 card. I have the 9560, so I’m not sure you can do that on a 13” XPS.[–]realeggnoodle[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)unfortunately not this one is soldered onto the board\n",

I really dont now what the heck is going on there but i called dell support and a new battery will be 80€ so i guess i will change it in the next couple of days.[–]Orion_Scattered 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago*(1 child)Fingers crossed for you my friend that that fixes it! The battery's health has actually been an aspect I've been very happy with. Typically by year 3 with a device it's become unusable or even battery swell kills it (RIP to my SP4 to that death (had a broken hinge too tho purely from age)). But with my XPS with only 21% wear I've barely noticed any diminishment. Though with that said the battery life from the beginning has always been trash--though with that said I know that my own use style is very much partly to blame for that, I chose the 4k OLED screen and I use max or high brightness always and use balanced power mode instead of battery saver whenever I can.For that reason among a ton more I realized awhile ago that I should have gone with the 17\" model for how I specced it--i7 9750H 6 core/12 thread and gtx 1650. For that performance tier I reallyyyyyy should have gone 17\" for the bigger battery (and I imagine better cooling, if just because of the bigger chassis for the head to spread better). Or saved a ton and gotten something way more portable with the 13\" with an i5. The 15\" is such an awkward middle child I think, but I only realized that after getting it. I came from using a Surface Pro 4 as my main device for a couple years so I was extremely hesitant to go 17\" but the 15\" is almost as thick and heavy anyway haha, with a smaller battery and screen for no meaningful exchange.Do you agree with my take on the 15\" vs the 17\" and 13\" or do you have a different perspective? It's sneaky rare to see other 15\" users in this sub or out in the wild. I've only ever seen the 13\" in real life and this sub is mostly 17\".So anyway it seems you may have gotten a faulty unit especially with that drop to 5% thing (reminds me a lot of my Nexus 6P's infamously buggy battery) so I do think replacing the battery will make it good as new for you. And luckily the battery is ssssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuperrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr easy to replace for XPS devices. But please do check tho just to be sure that you're running the latest BIOS and firmware. I don't know about your specific XPS model but over the last 3 years mine has had a couple BIOS and firmware releases with buggy power management issues that were fixed with an update. Pretty infuriating especially since those aren't always automatic updates and you have to go out and manually check to be 100% sure that you're up to date. But for your particular issue how you describe it this is probably unlikely, especially if started by coming on gradually and not all randomly all of a sudden.I've been procrastinating buying a new charger myself after my original barrel plug charger started to go bad a few months ago. It's been getting worse and worse--it started out that once every week or 2 I'd have to unplug and replug a couple times to get it to work, but now every single time I have to unplug, twist the cable around a bit, and replug, 10-30 times til it works. Sooner or later the wire's connection is going to fully break and I'll have to get a new one. What frustrates me tho is that you can't buy only the barrel plug cable, you have to buy an entire new charger. Like cmon that level of customer hostility and e-waste are absurd and should literally be illegal. The brick converter is fine and will be fine for the rest of time. Everyone knows it's the wire connection at the very end within inches of the barrel plug that is what goes bad. UGH! And then Dell made their USB-C charging proprietary!!! So if you want to charge with USB-C at the full 130W then you must buy their OEM charger. Which is what I am going to do and thankfully it's only like $70 compared to the barrel plug at like $120, but their proprietary 130W charger is not PowerDelivery compliant. So it can't even be my all-my-devices charger, that still has to be a separate charger thus more e-waste.Anyway sorry for the ranting, this comment has a grand total of like 2 whole sentences which might be helpful for you lol but every now and then it's good to just scream into the void to vent some frustration haha so I hope you don't mind. 😅 I went ahead and upvoted your post and comments for your time. 😊[–]RandomStuffWithPCs[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Concerning the battery size, I dont now how it is for the latest models but my XPS15s battery once had 97wh which is pretty close to the legal limit for batteries in  planes. Therefore i doubt that the XPS 17 has a considerably larger battery. Also i prefer the 15 inch formfactor as 13\" is just too small imo and 17\" can get bulky in backpacks.Luckily my charger is still running fine after 4 years but i was also very careful to not kink the cable too much. When it comes to e waste yes the charger is not optimal but atleast the ram, storage and battery is still uprgadable / exangable (looking at u apple).Bios updates might be a point i should check out. I can remember it once did a random bios update a couple month back but next to that the last one was like 3 years ago.\n",

I just checked, and I was plugging it into the one normal usb-c port. It actually works as expected when plugging into the thunderbolt port. But now I'm even more confused, because this worked on my surface book 2 which was not thunderbolt.  If still useful, these are the monitors I have: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N2L5CXO[–]compfixer87 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(3 children)Not sure, might be that your Surface Book had either Thunderbolt or a faster USB 3.2 at 20Gbps (often branded \"SuperSpeed\").  The XPS's non-Thunderbolt port only supports up to 10Gbps even though it is also USB 3.2.  The USBIF really, really screwed things up with their current naming \"convention\" and it pisses me off to no end.  Anyway.A single QHD signal at a 144Hz refresh rate can take up to 15.93 Gbps of bandwidth.  That basically exceeds what the standard (non-Thunderbolt) USB-C port on the XPS can do right there.  My guess is that if you plug back into the standard USB-C port you'll find that your monitor is operating below 144Hz and/or at a lower resolution.  Unplugging and then plugging back in the second monitor likely cause it to default to a lower resolution and/or refresh rate as well, which is why it worked.  Edit: typo.[–]TwistPickle[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(2 children)Super interesting! Thanks for the feedback. Well, it works with thunderbolt, so I'm actually good to go.[–]compfixer87 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(1 child)Hey, glad it worked out!

Also, if you think proficiency with Windows grants tech bona fides, I excitedly invite you to 'take it up a notch' and run Linux!  I kid, of course (every OS has its own legitimate uses), but feel free to reach out if you're ever interested.  Linux on my XPS 15 has been amazing!I don't disagree that many devices, and certainly almost every 'legacy' device still in use a this point, would use some version of USB-A, but the number of newer devices forcing you to stick with that standard is diminishing quickly.  We are definitely witnessing a transition, and transitions are always painful, but I really think it's for the better.  USB-C is a superior connector for an overwhelming number of reasons, and I'm super excited to see it continue to evolve.For me, personally, while I'm at my desk my devices use a combination of Bluetooth (headset and mouse) and connecting to a Thunderbolt dock.  In my personal experience and opinion, the Thunderbolt dock is awesome!  It can take a single USB-C connector on my XPS 15 to charge my laptop as well as provide connectivity to any HDMI, DisplayPort, networking, and USB devices.  I love it!When I'm \"out and about\", I tend to not need/use peripherals but I carry my mini USB-C to \"prety-much-everything\" adapter or use Bluetooth.  I personally have this in my bag so I have a wide variety of ports in a very small form factor while on the go; it even supports VGA.I'm not sure how viable the way I've updated my workflow over the past handful of years would work for you, but hopefully you can find something that will satisfy your needs.Edit: 'connection' to 'connector' and 'hub' to 'dock'[–]Revv23[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(5 children)Haha that is true I'm being unfair to apple users. I'm bitter from all the fanboys telling me that carrying around a dongle for my headphones is actually better than a 3.5mm jack. I have mad respect for the apple user that says his magic bar is better than the Fkey row and that there is no way that apple simply could have put the bar above the Fkey row. I actually have to give credit to apple for the return of the HDMI port AND the SD porT AND mag safe AND the Fkey row, though it's too bad they didn't keep the touch bar and do both. Ive ran Linux a few times and really enjoyed it. Its been years however. With the machines primary purpose being work travel, I'd probably have to dual boot to ensure compatibility with our business software. I guess I just have to get with the times and start living the dongle life, I'm just sick of companies removing features and telling me the product is better. Maybe I'm just the old man yelling at the cloud - but I'd guess I'm not the only person to hesitate/pass on this product  for this reason.[–]compfixer87 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(3 children)Hey, that was an awesome reply, and I can definitely sympathize where you're coming from.  You've definitely earned my respect on this topic with your reply, for what that's worth to you.  I can totally see why a person would view manufacturers consolidating all connectors into USB-C as a step backward, especially if they're staring down the reality of having to buy (potentially pricey) docks and dongles, not to mention having to make sure that those docks/dongles are always around when you need them or just plain not be able to use their stuff.  Buying new gear to replace stuff with a USB-A connector that otherwise works perfectly well also must feel like a waste of money and adding more trash to landfills for no reason.  I was there (to a lesser extent), and it can be frustrating.  However, I personally see this move by manufactures differently, especially after having lived with a current generation Dell XPS 15 for over half a year now.  When the serial and parallel ports were phased out in favor of the new \"Universal Serial Bus\" port, I'm sure that there were a lot of people stuck with peripherals they couldn't easily use with new machines.  That doesn't change the fact that USB was poised to completely alter the way we interfaced with our machines and it was the right move to make for computing, in general.  I don't think USB-C is set to change the world the way USB1.1 did, but it's a hell of a refinement and opens up tons of new possibilities that just aren't available to USB-A-based products.  I did measure, and the thickest part of the bottom half of my current-gen XPS 15 is around 7.5mm or so tall while the internal height of a USB-A port appears to be around 6mm.  That means that Dell would have had to make the laptop at least slightly thicker to accommodate a USB-A port.  Would doing so have been a reasonable tradeoff?  The market seems to think not as USB-C-only machines seem to be selling well, but that doesn't mean everyone will be happy with the decision.  Again, I personally look forward to a time when basically all devices just come with a USB-C cable or can communicate well via wireless (likely over Bluetooth).  On a different note, Coffee Lake is still a solid chip (you mentioned having a XPS from 2018, so I assume it has an Intel CPU of the Coffee Lake generation), so if you haven't started moving your devices over to Bluetooth and USB-C or if you aren't interested at all in using dongles/docks for the remaining USB-A stuff you can't live without, maybe hold off on getting a new machine (if you can) until you acquire more USB-C/Bluetooth devices naturally over time?  Or, as others have said, there are laptops out there that still provide the ports you're looking for (though that likely will mean a downgrade in screen quality).  It's definitely not an easy decision depending on your requirements.  Also, because I just can't help myself, I have to say that Linux has come a long way!  My first forays into Linux date back to SuSE in 2004 or so, and man it's a completely different beast now.  I jumped back in with both feet a few months ago after dabbling and running various distros in VMs for the past several years.  I started by dual-booting with Windows as well, but found I just didn't have reasons to go back and I eventually nuked that second drive to provide more storage for the computing I was doing in Linux.  Honestly, if you're ever interested in playing around with Linux and run into issues or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.  It's not perfect, and it's not for everyone, but it comes with a ton of benefits and I think most people can get by after relearning a thing or two (same goes for switching to MacOS, iPadOS, Android, and iOS for that matter).  Good luck with your decision![–]Revv23[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(2 children)Thank you for the kind reply! I see what you mean about the edges of the laptop, but that isn't actually the thickness of the laptop. They could have a less rounded edge or a small bumpout near the port without increasing the overall thickness of the laptop.My xps 15 is great, the main draw is that 17\" 16:10 screen giving you so much more real estate in pretty much the size of my current laptop. The 17 is actually a little thicker than than my 2018 model, but the edge is not nearly as rounded( on the 2018 model). I actually have a 2015 xps 13 as well and it runs great too.  I dont usually retire old hardware I repurpose how I use it. I have lots of mice laying around and when this laptop becomes my old laptop in a few years, it'll be really annoying to make sure it lives with the dongle at all times... (Maybe mounting tape it to the monitor? LOL. And in fact I do have one dongle in my life, it's the DIN to PS2 connector I use with my IBM model M! That keyboard is older than me and still seeing use. Thankfully they haven't killed PS2 yet. I still have a Logitech MX 518 I bought in 2005ish that is in use today as well. I ran Ubuntu with KDE back iin the day, and I loved it. But it didn't really solve any problems for me, and felt like work when I didn't know how to do something. Not to mention I'm a gamer and support up until recently for games has been less than great. Maybe Linux would be fun to try on my XPS13. I dont think I have time for another hobby right now though! Plus if I get a new notebook I have a new job lined up for the 13 already.

Any tech you want USB-A for, you can get it with USB-C now. Any monitor you want HDMI for, you can get it with USB-C. HDMI is horrible for the size of it vs its bandwidth. USB-C is about to reach 80gbps speeds with the upcoming thunderbolt 5 even though it is a tiny port.Today, no dongles are needed for anything USB-C as everything has its usb-c version already.[–]KindElfThrowaway 5 points6 points7 points 8 months ago(28 children)Embrace the Dock life[–]Revv23[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(27 children)Haha all this progress to return to 1990s.We made the laptop smaller so you can fit all the extra accessories you'll need into your bag.[–]KindElfThrowaway 5 points6 points7 points 8 months ago(22 children)Not really.

It won't of course lol, but maybe closer to universal.I remember like 5-6 years ago I had to buy either a dell or apple power brick to get 45w usb-c charging on my xps-13. I think it was like 80 bucks or something crazy for the dell model. Now 45 bricks are pretty common. Since I started this post ive been looking around I know dell is running a 130w brick but they only can charge @ 100w still so the xps17 actually will eventually die under 100% load after a while. I'm not sure if this has been fixed in the 2022 model or not. So theoretically if you got a good 100w aftermarket brick that can push it all to 1 port you should be able to charge a current xps. On my 15 this doesn't work but it may not have supported 100w PD. The main thing that scares me about 240w PD is people burning their homes down with cheap cables LOL.[–]fuzzyp44 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(5 children)The problem is that there aren't USB C wireless mice.It's adapters for USB a all the way down.Having a wireless mouse adapter that stays plugged is a major use case that seems to be missing.They need to make a wide one that doesn't stick out so you need to remove it.

But I only roll 1.44mb high density 3.5inch. :-). I'm just annoyed as this these are senseless omissions on a flagship device. Hell even apple just added back HDMI to their macbook pro. In this class of device you shouldn't have less features than the budget options.[–]geeered 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(4 children)Yea, that'd annoy me having to use a USB-A to parallel adaptor ;) This is a flagship device that's based on being compact - you can get a Precision with all the ports in the world and a form factor to match[–]Revv23[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(3 children)Thats the same excuse phone manufacturers use when they remove options. They can fit those two ports on this chassis without making it thicker.​I know because both ports are on my thinner 2018 XPS 15.​Edit - I'm not trying to be combative - it just always boggles my mind when companies shrinkflate their products, and then the consumers get online to explain why it's great having less features than the outgoing model.[–]geeered 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(2 children)I was kinda with you before living with a USB-C only XPS.I'd prefer to have more USB-C ports.Especially because it's incredibly easy and barely takes any size to change USB-C to A.  I bought a 3 pack for £5 or so I think, but find I barely use it - because I'm using the dock all the times I want to use a mouse etc.[–]Revv23[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(1 child)I mean, if you are using a dock, what use do you have for 4 USB-C? Especially on 17in model where power consumption is too high to charge thru USB. Obviously docked at home is no big deal. I use a desktop at home this is for work on the road. On the road you lose dongles and adapters and batteries and stuff breaks and have to borrow stuff from other people etc etc ...[–]KindElfThrowaway 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(2 children)The new xps laptops have a little adapter in the box which has hdmi and USB 3.1.

It's conveniently never around when you need it. The razer line is legit - but you have to give up that screen that makes xps best in class.. Which just makes it feel shameful that in the 3k price range every product is a sacrifice. It's wild - what the heck would you ever need 4 thunderbolt ports for? Flip out two of them and give us a USB-A and HDMI.[–]WherMyEth 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)This is all a really short-sighted take on USB-C. The benefit of USB-C isn't for you to connect your legacy peripherals to one of the most expensive laptops on the market. But because you're in this class it's fair to assume you can afford to buy USB-C peripherals and SSDs, use external monitors with USB-C, etc. What's the benefit? Less cables and connectors in the future. I can already charge my phone and laptop from the same brick, attach any of the three laptops I have to the same monitors in my house at work, and use the same external SSD without worrying much about speed. When you're spending $3K on a new laptop it should be fair to assume you can afford switching your peripherals to a USB-C or wireless equivalent. It's the future. Adoption will start in the high-end segment and then trickle it's way down to mainstream consumers. I personally do not miss any of the old ports at all. With HDMI you never knew which version was supported, on laptops mini DisplayPort was common, and I've long switched to Bluetooth earbuds.[–]JustaTexaninBoston 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(0 children)The future is now, old man.

First they are universal, so they work with any laptop or device. The 90's styles were all proprietary to the brand/model. Next, they are a single cable rather than some type of cradle. Replacing 7+ cables with a single USB C was a huge improvement. It's so much easier to grab my laptop and go. I can also cable manage properly making my desk much cleaner.USB A was released in 1996.USB C was released in 2014.8 years after a better version was created and 28 years after its introduction companies are dropping USB A (on their ultra-books). It was just a matter of time. There are still models that have all the ports, but they tend to be desktop replacements and are less likely to be on the go. As such, they benefit less from a dock.Amazon sells USB A to C adapters that can fit on the end of cables or devices to quickly upgrade them so they don't need to be fully replaced.I highly recommend a thunderbolt dock if you tend to disconnect your laptop often. If your laptop tends to sit on your desk and never move, I'd point you to a different model as opposed to the ultra-portable XPS line.Good luck![–]FormerHPB 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(1 child)Just get a Bluetooth mouse.[–]Revv23[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)I'll just not buy this laptop.[–]TRGsGobi 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago(3 children)Just got my xps 17 and went ahead and bought a bluetooth wireless mouse.

I agree with you that 8th gen is still perfectly suited for use today, and I'd say it will be for much longer than another 2 years, I have a devils canyon rig at one workstation that is still a pretty darn fast machine. The last machine I retired was a core2duo the power supply blew up on and I figured the machine wasn't worth a power supply anymore.

I was thiiiiis close to getting a 13\" M1 macbook pro this winter. I have absolutely zero need for one but gosh darnit it was getting me so excited lol.What actually got me to pull the trigger a couple years ago on the 7590 was when the new 16x10 design was announced. I wanted the 16x9. Silly me, I had never had an OLED laptop before so I didn't realize it was a dumb decision point lol. But I got it on discount! An Alder Lake XPS on steep enough discount after 13th gen debuts might be worth an upgrade, but you may be better off waiting for more maturity since ports are a big thing for you. Only having 1 thunderbolt 3 port on my 7590 is annoying. If the 14th gen has like 4 ports all TB4 or something... whewy.Devil's Canyon is one I haven't heard in a hot minute lol. My first gaming rig I built myself was Ivy Bridge, the trusty i5 3570k. Though I also cobbled together either a Bulldozer or Piledriver AMD FX build out of scrap parts at work when I was at a systems integrator a few years ago. It felt ridiculous using like a 200W cpu to do spreadsheets, but man those early AMD 4 core 8 thread CPUS handled multitasking ssssoooooo much better than pentium chips 6 or 7 years newer.Only PC I've had to retire or see bite the dust was my Surface Pro 4. It was a perfect note-taking/on the go device for a couple years (gotten on discount anyway) but the i5 U was starting to struggle and then the hinge went out. Used it for another couple months til finally the battery swelled and killed it. :( Tried a few mid-tier devices which I returned til I finally settled on the XPS and now I never want to leave this brand, it's like they're made for me lol. Though I have learned to go with either a 13 or 17. The 15 doesn't make much sense to me. Anyway that SP4 had a 6th gen i5 U which only stayed snappy a couple years, but my desktop's i5 6500 is still more than usable now 6 years later. Skylake and Kaby Lake man, these devices are gonna last forever in certain use cases.[–]Revv23[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Althon X2 was a good time. Bulldozer was awesome.

      "content of comments: (8 children)I can only speak to my experience, so this may not be 100% certain, but from my experience, doing a fresh or clean install of Windows on a laptop that had native Dolby Vision can break the dolby vision. My experience was on a Lenovo machine, and here's a post from that time:https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/jj2qzb/restoring\\_dolby\\_vision\\_after\\_a\\_clean\\_install/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3The only way I was able to get native Dolby Vision support back was to request an image of the factory settings of the machine from Lenovo and install that (which of course entirely defeated the purpose of the clean install).

But perhaps you just meant higher graphical requirements, in which case the integrated Iris Xe Graphics could fit.[–]S117s 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(1 child)I have a Dell XPS 13 9360 (16Gb RAM and 512GB storage) and am an engineering student who has used it to the better part of 4 years. I use very similar software to you but more focused on MATLAB, python and VHDL coding to FPGAs. In terms of the new XPS 13 running MATLAB and any coding language. It will handle it with ease. MATLABs compiler as well as any other compiler or interpreter will optimise tasks based on what hardware you have. If it detects a GPU it will optimise the compiler to include the GPU if need be. I find that the Dell XPS 13 when compiling code or using MATLAB to be absolutely fine. Not as fast as my desktop PC but fast enough when I'm away from my PC. So the new XPS will be much faster and better with these kind of tasks. But if you run any 3D CAD or FEA software. It will do it albeit the those programs drain the battery significantly. My XPS 13 can handle basic tasks like make sketches excursion and making basic 3d models. Though if you are thinking of doing FEA work alot looking at the XPS15 with a dedicated GPU. Overall the new XPS13 will be able to handle MATLAB coding and all other types of coding and light 3D CAD work and very light FEA analysis. If my XPS 13 9360 can handle this work then the new one will fly through it thanks to the 12th core processor. My advice as student is this though. If you have a main PC with a GPU at home or in a dorm. Then get new XPS 13 for portability and light tasks. If you are wanting your laptop as your main work computer that does everything then get the XPS15 with dedicated graphics.Hope that helps 😃[–]AbbreviationsFew1525[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)hey man! thank you for your advise. really appreciate it! i have already went ahead and ordered the XPS13+. hahaha. hopefully i dont regret it. but really thanks for the detailed insight on this. 👍🏼🤙🏼\n",

You have 15 bright white lights shinning at you during the day, and then at night if you are watching a movie, it's even more distracting.

Most of my games can't even play well because of thermal throttling.It also has a lot of firmware issues. I'm currently battling with a bug that crashes my system every time I hibernate it.Also, I've had to change the battery within just three months of ownership because of swelling.[–]filteredwater12[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(10 children)Hey.

Thanks.[–]WintersShadow12 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(9 children)No problem. To be clear, these issues are on an XPS15, I dont know if they carry over to the 13 series.But have you considered a Mac?[–]filteredwater12[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(8 children)I actually have tried a 14inch MacBook Pro. I couldn’t stand the OS. I’m too ingrained into the Microsoft ecosystem. I was looking at the dell xps 13 and the Samsung book pro 2, but so far I haven’t heard good things of either.[–]WintersShadow12 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(0 children)Have you looked at maybe a Surface studio since you're looking for an ultrabook.[–]Hickfd 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(4 children)I am also between these two. What have you heard about the Book2 pro? I only know what online reviews say, but I don't know anyone who own one.[–]othersteve 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(3 children)As both a computer tech consultant/repair professional and a reviewer who has published over 100 reviews of different laptops, I absolutely would not recommend getting a Surface device—you're probably far better off with an XPS 13 as at least a) they're repairable and b) Dell has pretty great support overall compared to others.[–]Hickfd 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(2 children)I meant the Samsung Galaxy Book 2 Pro... Not Surface.[–]othersteve 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(1 child)Oh gotcha; my bad, misread your comment! I've less experience with that one so can't say one way or another. Build quality on Samsungs is excellent, every bit as good as XPS if not better. Also can't beat their nand flash/SSDs, which they use in their own systems. Finally, the screens are absolutely gorgeous. Again though, support doesn't seem anywhere nearly as robust... Probably a factor of low market share. You won't get on-site support with it as you would with Dell either. As long as you're cool with that it's probably worth considering.[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(0 children)The resolution on the Samsung is 1920 x 1080.  This does not deliver a full ‘retina’ effect.  I was surprised & disappointed.[–]Ohmygosh0 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Don't buy the Samsung 13\".

Oh, and be able to play games.[–]WherMyEth 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(5 children)You know, sometimes people will leave some performance on the tablet for build quality, maximum portability and battery life. Not to mention the G14 doesn't have Thunderbolt or USB-C charging (for full capacity) both of which wre dealbreakers to me and many others. I see gaming laptops recommended too often on Reddit. It's not always what people are looking for.[–]Cats_Cameras 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(4 children)But even if you take away gaming, the New XPS 13 is in a bad place (and I say this as an older XPS 13 owner who loved that laptop): No headphone jack, fake F and Esc keys, borderless annoying trackpad, no USB A, etc.  I'd pick the 9310 or G14 over the New XPS for an XPS 13 class notebook, let alone compared to competitors like the Carbon.  It's overpriced and under-featured.https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-plus(Also, the G14 can charge 100% over USB C.)[–]WherMyEth 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago*(3 children)I don't see how a couple of design decisions make it under-featured? The trackpad remains functional, as do the F and ESC keys. It's simply a different design to achieve the same goal. The XPS 13 Plus punches back with a 28W CPU and extremely thin chassis, something not even the previous gen XPS 13 can compete with because it just didn't have the thermal headroom to cram in 16 cores. As I said, people can have their preferences. But for me this is the first XPS I even considered because it finally brings the performance I want to the table. Why they never considered AMD is beyond me, but now with 12th gen Intel I get the same thing. The G14 is a gaming laptop. It's heavier, thicker, and definitely not built as well. 100W USB-C charging is available on it, true. Though I'm not sure that would let the CPU and GPU boost to their highest TDP.Edit: The review you shared is a great example of biased journalism, as the following excerpts show. And because it’s more expensive than a standard XPS 13, you’re essentially paying for less – even if the CPU is going to be marginally faster. You do get a higher-power P-series Intel processor with a power budget of 28W, but that likely won’t make a big enough difference in day-to-day performance to be worth it for most people.While it's okay to want a headphone jack (just get a laptop with one) the CPU isn't \"marginally faster\" - as the actual review by LinusTechTips and Dave2D show this is how Dell makes the XPS 13 Plus competitive with the M1 series of Apple MacBooks. No 11th gen Intel had that kind of performance or efficiency. Dell was able to create something that doesn't just do web browsing or light Photoshop well, but I was able to get it because that number of cores and the 32GB RAM option allows me to do real coding on it, running virtual machines and container applications like Kubernetes. Same goes for their comments on the touchpad. They haven't tested it, so how can they know? According to other reports that got review models it's easy to get used to because it's a large touchpad in the center of the bottom surface. For simple tasks the classic XPS is still there. But the Plus is hands down the most powerful 13-inch device on the market and will have lots of people considering it as a portable workstation.[–]Cats_Cameras 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago*(2 children)A powerful laptop that is miserable to use with dongles and cut basic keys is a bad laptop.It's kind of telling that you're crowing about performance versus a 2020 Macbook M1 with a much lower power draw, as well.[–]WherMyEth 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(1 child)If you rely on peripherals with USB-A and AUX on a daily basis, then sure. Don't buy it. Find something a little bigger or wait for the regular XPS 13 to be updated with U-series chips. I never mentioned a MacBook model year. But Windows ARM support isn't there yet - I'd argue neither is MacOS, and as a developer I have no interest in the compatibility woes and just want the most performance I can get out of the machine. The Dell XPS 13 Plus fits that better than anything else out there right now. My workflow doesn't involve peripherals usually, if anything it's connected to an external monitor with a built-in USB hub, and Bluetooth headphones, so for a lot of people I am sure Dell will have created something pretty unique. Even the Fn, Esc and Del keys might be controversial, but I never had an issue with the touchbar and having a visual queue of which set of keys is activated (Fn vs media) is pretty useful to me. It's not a bad laptop. It just isn't for you. That's fine, but your superiority complex is misplaced when a company with billions to spend on market research surely has done their research before creating it. Seeing some reviews I'm sure their sales numbers will reflect that.[–]Ohmygosh0 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Each has its own cases. If you want a nice powerful 13\" ultrabook that looks very nice, there's no device like XPS 13+.However, Dell achieved it by making some sacrifices like removing the headphone jack, function keys, and track pad. I for example personally don't mind those changes at all, but I am also not interested in 13\".[–]Ohmygosh0 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Yes, the xps 13 plus is one of the most powerful 13\" laptops out there for cpu intensive applications. If you want to use it for programming, then it will serve you. I don't know what you mean by design. Phtoshop is cpu intensive, so it's ideal with xps 13 plus. However, if you would do 3d designs, then you will need a better GPU.\n",

As I see it, you have two options:What size is the fan of the original air cooler?  I have the AIO so I don't know.  I'm using all the fan headers now so I do have a lot of experiments there.  I've even added a 140 lower front fan.Observations on the stock fan headers:Orange header(Fan_1) and White (Fan_CPU)  header (which I assume you're using) connected fans go up in unison when do Cinebench tests, so PWM works.Front fan header doesn't really go up unless the case gets really hot.[–]Uruzu5[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(0 children)Your solution for CPU fans looks good. It's just that the original CPU cooler is smaller than the new CPU cooler. So I have no idea how to mount it on the new CPU cooler.For the PWM fan issue, the fan speed cannot be varied and more like 0, 50, 100% speed 3 choice only. So, it looks worse than the 3 pin DC fan on the speed control.[–]Whos_Blockin_Jimmy 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)There’s got to be a way to just add the noctura fans straight up swap.

Idk why the headphone jack is so controversial these days.  They pulled it from their docks last year and now a popular laptop.  I'm tired of design asthetics taking the lead over utility.  Computers are tools, not pieces of art.  I stick with Dell over HP because they usually have more utilitarian designs but that's shifted over the last few years.  I may push for framework laptops in a couple years because of Dell's push to solder everything to the board and now custom RAM modules.[–]othersteve 1 point2 points3 points 9 months ago(0 children)Still, at least the Dells (in their defense) are much easier to open up than the HPs, which typically like to hide screws beneath the rubber feet. Also, the metal is notably thicker. I, too, am averse to form over function design philosophy, but I must admit, I wound up ordering an XPS 13 Plus (ETA 5/9) to get ahead of the curve for my tech consulting clients since it's just so unique.[–]ipSyk 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(2 children)12th Gen Framework is out now btw[–]naps1saps[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(1 child)Thanks.

They're dirt cheap and everyone used to complain about cables when those were the norm. Unless you're equipping audio engineers, for regular calls and such Bluetooth audio is more than sufficient. I prefer them. The touchpad also seems to work perfectly fine, regardless if its with or without the visual queues, since it's big and centered on the device. Dell does seem to have justification for all of their controversial moves as well - no device is that thin and squeezing 28W out of the CPU except the XPS 13 Plus and the fact that it goes head to head with the extremely optimized M1 Macs is saying something. My point is, there's no need to shit on the product because they made some design decisions you don't like. It's especially unnecessary to hate on the \"hipsters\" it's targeted at. Just buy your HPs and Framework laptops if you want to.[–]wowbaggerBR 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(0 children)Yeah, I'm with you on this one.

      "content of comments: (0 children)Any chance your laptop is actually 9560? If you're semi tech inclined you can replace yourself. A used screen assembly for the 9560 cost just under $100. If you buy the whole assembly, you can follow a guide from youtube and should take under 1 hour to replace.I mean that is a good machine, if you hadn't broke the screen, that thing could still go at least 2-3 years if not more. Buying a similar machine on today's model could run you over $1000 USD. A used 9560 cost about $400. Even if you take to a shop to get fixed, $250 still lower than buying a whole new laptop. For $250-300 you will not find a good machine as that one. But you could get a latitude 7490 for about $300 that will work great for office work. If you call a couple more places, someone will do it for maybe $200 or less if you tell them you are ok getting a used screen. Hope this helps.[–]ssuper2k 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago(0 children)Use it with an external monitor..Or sell it for 100-150$ and buy another one (but newer)\n",

      "content: hey there. i've been using xps products since 2017., amazing looking laptops packing amazing battery life (on paper) and amazing hardware (on paper) for a not-so-amazing price. i got my hands on a xps 17 9700 in the summer of 2021. (so a year after it released) during the discount period. i'm kind of sad i didn't grab a rtx3060 version of the laptop but the original 9700 with a rtx2060 has been good to me. i picked it up with an i7 10th gen, fhd panel, put my own 32gb ram in it. first of all - i got a lemon. i had the power drain issue and i had the wobbly touchpad issue, coil whine amongst the others... the problem with this laptop is that it is like an android device - you need to tinker, root, debloat, slap a custom rom and tinker with the cpu governor it to make it a seamless experience that uses the maximum out of the hardware it has. so tinker did i do. first of all, msi afterburner undervolted the gpu and raised the frequency by ~200. the undervolt gave me more performance, less heat and was a step towards fixing the power drain during heavy loads. second thing i did was disable one cpu core in bios and unlocked undervolting and installed throttlestop and undervolted the cpu cores by -155mv and cpu cache by -145mv (it seems i won the silicon lottery on that, going any lower than that on cpu cache just straight up crashes the machine whereas -145mv is oddly enough stable through most intensive tasks). also undervolted intel gpu and slice by ~-65. this dropped temps like crazy and consequentially dropped power load down a ton to the point where i had no power drain while doing intensive tasks while having the same kind of performance. in fivr settings i dropped turbo ratio limits by half a ghz, this was for my \"normal\" profile i use for everyday browsing, working, gaming, etc. \"performance\" profile keeps the cores at max turbo ratio, this is for editing and stuff like that. 3rd profile i have is battery which just straight up kneecaps the entire pc (max boost is 2.8ghz) and allows me to squeeze out ~11-12 hours on battery while performance in windows and all programs you expect to run on battery is still amazing. i also fiddled with tpl and put pl1 on 35watts and pl2 on 45watts for \"normal\" mode. this whole ordeal not only gave me more performance but also fixed my coil whine and fixed the power draw issue. third thing i did was repaste the cpu, this was a fine enough improvement. when repasting you make sure you tighten all the screws down real nice, this fixes the wobbly touchpad issue. recently i learned of a thing called \"ptm7950\", it's an industrial grade thermal pad. i got mine off of moddiy.com because it seems to sell the legit version, let me tell you, this thing is fucking insane. it's like having liquid metal cooling in the laptop with none of the drawbacks (it's not conductive so you can't kill your pc). after applying honeywell ptm7950 to both the cpu and the gpu, temps (which have already been amazing) have further dropped and during idle work (browsing, typing, watching yt) in windows the fans have never spun op (optimized profile in dell power manager for the record), during prolonged gaming sessions the cpu never went above 60 and gpu never went above ~68-70 while delivering insane performance. when connected to an external monitor (3440x1440 34\" widescreen 144hz) the temps went up by ~5-8 degrees which i wasn't happy with but lived with, until i found out a bitter truth - dell rubber feet don't elevate the laptop as they should and on some surfaces it straight up chokes due to lack of air. currently i fix this by elevating it with a single small screwdriver (just an extra 2cm above the surface level compared to default feet) and as i write this i can't seem to break 60c temps on cpu while gaming, haven't editted or compiled anything yet though so that'd be an interesting test. if anyone knows of custom rubber feet i can install that are higher than dell's default, let me know. fourth thing i did was something i guess some people consider a dealbreaker - i killed ordinary sleep function and just made the laptop hibernate when i close the lid. sleep overheating already happened once to me and i'm not risking my hardware on m$'s shoddy implementation of modern sleep. so overall - am i happy? fucking hell yes. ~11+ hours on battery, no overheating during any work (burned hands are a thing of the past), ultra silent during work sessions, gaming sessions bring out the max from hardware and it feels better than any gaming laptop i have owned, no throttling or any problems whatsoever. i fixed all of the problems the laptop came with (coil whine, wobbly touchpad, power draw) and anyone who ever held a screwdriver or googled how to fix a problem can do it on their own too. the machine works beyond dell engineer's wildest dreams in its current state and i'm seriously happy with it. would i recommend it to anyone? yep, if you love to tinker and google problemsolve, you can fix the entire laptop up in less than 4 hours of work and have a perfect machine. if you don't, well, i don't think xps lineup is for you, unless you're happy with out-of-the-box stuff (which plenty of people are i guess, i'm not though) even if you don't get any lemons.\n",

The Fn Lock setting can be used to switch the need to hold down the Fn key. Pressing Fn-esc reverses the setting. Pressing it again reverses it again. However, it reverses all of the function keys: F1 to F12. Unfortunately, there's no way to reverse for only F1 to F10 which is what you're asking for.The BIOS also has a setting for the Fn Lock which enables the machine to boot up an OS with the behavior you want (so you wouldn't need to remember to press Fn-esc). But again, no setting for just F1 to F10.As for the Home and End keys, I just use fn-left-arrow for Home and fn-right-arrow for End (yes they do work and no there is no key legend to indicate that they do this). I do this all the time now and don't use the home[F11] or end[F12] keys anymore.HTH.[–]darklajid[S] 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago(1 child)Thank you so much, you saved me so much frustration.Changed the BIOS to start up with proper Fx keys, confirmed that fn+cursor is home/end and works with ctrl as ctrl+home/end too.

Unless, of course, cable or unit has gone bad. Cheers.[–]jc1luv 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)It's really not worth the money unless your setup requires it. It's just too expensive ATM, and tb3 is still widely used and fast enough. We use the tb16s with tb3 to run dual monitors and peripherals.

      "We recently got new machines with tb4 and nvme gen4 for our data transfer rig, and the transfer speeds for large files are insane.

We got some wd22tb4 just for those machines, so we don't have to have a ton of donggles since they only have tb4 type c ports. Other than the transfer speeds, we notice no other difference. Technically, you could run more monitors at higher bandwidth, but like I said, it's not important if you don't require it.TL:DR - Stick with displayport type c / tb3 unless you specifically need tb4.

      "content of comments: (0 children)Am I eligible to replace this Dell laptop (purchased in November 2022) with a new laptop?most consumer electronics items purchased brand new are covered by a warranty. In this case, it's at least 12 months and depends on what support package was chosen at the time of the machine's purchase. For example, my XPS has 2 years cover under the Premium Support tier.Since your machine is not working at all, I would expect Dell to organize a technician to inspect the machine and perhaps replace the faulty component.To find your warranty cover and period, enter your service tag into the Dell Support website, then navigate to Overview > Support services status. Obviously, you cannot do this using the machine itself at this time so you'll need to manually enter the tag (if you go to the site using the machine, it will enter the tag for you).​I was under the impression that by purchasing an expensive machine, I would have fewer problems.the computer is an electronic device and is subject to the laws of physics. As far as I know, money doesn't affect the way physics works. Money probably gets you better quality parts but those parts can still fail.HTH.\n",

      "content of comments: (19 children)Yes, you can absolutely do that. I wouldn't encourage it though. You can put a NVMe SSD in that system - so I'd ensure you do that (your 256GB may be SATA) to gain maximum performance. What I would do is perform a clean install, run all windows updates, then copy any data I needed over from the 256GB before wiping it and stuffing it in a USB caddy.[–]willwar63[S] 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago(18 children)The SSD in my system is not SATA, it's NVMe M.2. Its a card that plugs into the motherboard. I just want a bigger drive. I want to clone it to a 1TB NVMe and use that instead. I have however done this many times with SATA drives. The system should see it the same. You shouldn't have to reinstall anything. I use Acronis to do this. I was asking before I go out and buy the drive. I have a dock but that is obviously not for NVMe drives, it's for SATA.[–]Cyberprog 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)Fair enough. I normally advocate clean install. It's good for the soul and usually gives better performance.[–]Cyberprog 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(14 children)Ah, also I see what you mean about the slot. Unless you have access to a system with two m.2 slots you won't be able to clone. That's assuming the version of acronis is capable of doing operations to that.[–]jfoust2 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago(2 children)For $20 you can get an adapter.\n",

Haven't actually looked. Acronis will create an image of your entire hard drive and store it on a USB external, hard drive, network drive or wherever you want to save it. I plan on saving it to an external USB drive.Once I back it up, I will remove existing NVMe drive, boot from USB with Acronis software and restore the image from the external to the new drive. Remove the USB boot disk, install and boot from the new NVMe drive.It works with SATA drives for sure, I've done it many times on different systems.Will not affect performance in the least. In theory, the new drive is an exact replica of the old drive only larger and should not affect performance. . It's all electronic, no moving parts.I posted a question on the Acronis sub. We'll see. Thanks.[–]OliverEntrails 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(7 children)I do this all the time just like you have described. Have used Acronis in the past, but migrated to Macrium Reflect - better handling of the change from a small drive to a large one. It can automatically extend the partition to use all of the available space on the new hard drive.[–]Cyberprog 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)Fair enough. I know I ran into this when I needed to wipe some NVMe drives and the darik's boot and nuke iso didn't find them. Had to use ShredOS instead.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)You'll probably need a NVMe to USB enclosure to clone the Samsung SSD.The only alternative I can think of is to install a PCIe addin card with a NVMe-compatible slot. The PCIe slot needs to have PCIe 3.0 x4 electrical connectivity at least.FYI, since one of the drives is a Samsung, you could also clone it using Samsung's Data Migration software which you can get from Samsung's website.HTH.[–]Camelfoe -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago(1 child)I tried doing exactly what you want to do (512Mb to 2Tb).  I ended up having to do a clean install, because I couldn't get any cloning software to work.  They just wouldn't finish the job, kept failing halfway through.  Back up any personal files you want to keep, write down the Windows Activation Key (see below) then swap the drives.  You can get the Win11 install files on Microsoft's site.  There's a version that will fit on a small USB drive and download files as they're needed.  The key is most likely stored permanently on your motherboard, so that's not a problem (but download a key extractor anyway and write it down, just in case).  Then I plugged the old drive into a USB enclosure.  If you don't have one yet, make sure you get a case with good heat management, mine gets surprisingly hot.[–]willwar63[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago(0 children)Its Windows 10, should activate since it is licensed through Dell. I bought it direct from Dell.com. There should be a way to do it with Acronis. Its not exactly a clone. It's a full backup of the source, then a restore on the target. The backup includes the uefi and all of the partitions. Getting it to boot is what I'm not sure about. Time will tell. The 1tb is on $54 on Amazon. I can always reinstall if I need to or even return it it doesn't work.[–]doctormink -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago(3 children)Maybe things have changed but last time I tried to do a system image the drives had to be exactly the same size.[–]OliverEntrails 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago(2 children)Not anymore. The new disk cloning software can restore to a new larger or smaller drive by adjusting the size of the data partition. My favorite is Macrium Reflect for those purposes - although I've used Acronis and the Samsung migration software in the past.[–]doctormink 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(1 child)What about when you're using the native Windows system imager?[–]OliverEntrails 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(0 children)It was very labor intensive. I often made mistakes resizing partitions on the new drive or doing them over and over again until it was \"perfect.\" You can try Macrium for example for free for 30 days - get your clone done and not worry about it until next time. For myself, I was working on machines regularly and buying the program just made the most sense and saved me tons of time.Backups also can be automated, encrypted and protected from malware and ransomware.[–]MrTomatosoupXPS 13 9350 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)So I have a 9350, it might be a little different. I just installed a m.2 ssd and it worked fine. I copied the downloads, documents and other 'main' folders and just used a USB stick as an install medium for windows. It recognized the motherboard and windows license right away. I copied the folders and then the only thing I had to do was install software.[–]neurodivergentowl 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(0 children)I did this recently with a similar Dell laptop. Just needed more space. I upgraded from a 128gb m.2 nvme to a 512gb one. I used an external usb nvme adapter from Amazon, and the trial version of macrium reflect. Run macrium with the original SSD in the laptop. Connect the external drive and let it run. It copies directly from the internal drive to the news drive via the usb dongle. Then swap in the new SSD and it booted perfectly first try.\n",

If the battery was always problematic it’s possible that the power and voltage regulation circuit had a fault all along and eventually failed causing full current flow from the battery, kind of like touching jumper leads together on a car battery.

I guess you have either the I5 (no nvidia) or the I7 with GTX 1650. I would say that the motherboard is beyond repair, and you will need a adoption board or a brand new one. In that cause you are best off just buying a new computer less you know how to find and do this yourself.[–]mauros_lykos 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)Probably there are other parts damaged.

That is the power delivery aka VRM package for, what I assume, is the CPU under those heat pipes. Could it be repaired? Possibly. Is it likely? no. Even if it can be repaired, it would be cheaper to replace the board. Especially since there's a high probability that this has killed the CPU as well.As for why, no way of knowing for sure without serious diagnostics, but it looks like moisture could have played a roll. It looks as though the three mosfets all went at the same time as well as that resistor on the end... that's highly unlikely for all of those components to fail simultaneously and it looks like there's a lot of corrosion around them, but like I said... can't say for sure. I could be wrong.Sometimes components just die, sometimes they kill other components when they do elsewhere in the circuit.[–]jc1luv 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)As mentioned, this area is where the power controllers are. Somewhere in there was a short. It's pretty bad damage, even if some of those components could be replaced, which they can, looks so burnt that if you manage to clean the board, you'll likely see some damaged power tracks right on the board.\n",
      "If you intend to keep the laptop, look for a used board and just replace it, but because the board is probably the most expensive, you're better off getting a newer laptop without any issues. Makes more sense. Along with not knowing where the issue originated, you might have other damage out of the board area.[–]fabiengagne 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)These components look like power MOSFETs (transistors)? Just south of them you can see two large capacitors (black, in good shape, with a \"+\" sign).This circuit seems to be for the power delivery to the CPU.You could save the RAM and SSD. Resell them or install in you new laptop.[–]-Paul-Chambers- 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago*(0 children)I'm in agreement with several other folks. That looks power-related, they're probably VRM supplies given how close they are to the CPU. There's a good chance that the CPU power rails went out-of-spec while this was happening, so it's probably toast, too. And the damage may not end there. That kind of failure can stress other components, so even if the laptop works after being repaired, it may fail prematrely later. Even if someone could repair that plus any collateral damage, I doubt it would be cost-effective. That's why it's usually better to replace a laptop motherboard than to do component-level repairs on one that failed.Honestly, judging by that damage, it's time for a new laptop.[–]splunge333 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)You'll pour time and resources into a fail.[–]Threnners 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)They are deceased, whatever they are.\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)The WD19S should be able to handle your monitors, as it supports Display port 1.4 and HDMI 2.0.That said, even though the HDMI and DP specs support it on on paper, I have been unable to get my XPS 15 9520 to output any refresh rate higher than 60Hz, despite the dock and my monitor supporting it.  Both my old WD17 dock I use at home and my fancy WD22TB4 from work only output 60Hz from the laptop to my gaming monitor.  So I don't think a Thunderbolt dock will really help you here.With regards to actual game performance, it should work about as well through the dock as it does on the laptop itself.  Just make sure that you are forcing the game to use the Nvidia 3050ti instead of the Intel integrated graphics.Your biggest limitation will be thermal throttling of the CPU and GPU due to Dell's poor cooling design.  Keep the laptop elevated while gaming so that it can breathe, and if you're comfortable with doing so, consider re-pasting the CPU and GPU with higher quality thermal paste.With regards to tearing, forcing Vsync will be your only option.  I dont know why you are still getting tearing even with it on, unless its on in the NVidia control panel but the Intel GPU is causing some kind of issue with it.The way the graphics chipset in these XPS laptops is designed, monitors are always physically attached to the integrated Intel GPU rather than the Nvidia 3050ti.  This means that while you can use the Nvidia GPU to render the graphics, the Intel GPU is the component actually displaying to the monitor.  For game performance this will still give you the benefit of the Nvidia GPU's horsepower, but it makes it impossible to use GSync or \"GSync Compatible\" VRR; the Intel controller is in the way preventing the Nvidia GPU from directly 'talking to' the monitor, which is required for VRR to work.\n",

Put it in a very specific position where it never changes it's position, and then after 3 months of not changing position, it suddenly craps out because of not mechanically connecting to your laptop properly?That makes absolutely no sense. If it is a physical problem with the connection that degrades over time, something has to happen to the charger or cable that fascilitates that degradation. If it were crappy components being used, I would get that it may die suddenly. But if it starts working again when jiggling the connector, then there must've been something that degrades the connection over time.Are you sure your are not moving or otherwise putting strain on the connectors in your \"specific position\"?[–]OdyDggy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(0 children)I don't know because the other two failed the same way, the cable just starts acting up I got the new one and said I'll leave wrapped around the brick and I'll use it like that.

And the 3rd one is an original, just not bought from Dell.I may just be that unlucky...[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(3 children)I can understand that a charger becomes faulty in a short period of time. My XPS 15's battery failed 3 months after I got the machine.However, if any hardware you have fails that quickly, you have a warranty cover for it (the warranty is 12 months from when you bought it). I got my battery replaced under warranty with no charge to me.So what I don't understand is why you didn't exercise your warranty rights and have the charger replaced under warranty? If your first charger failed within 6 months of getting the machine, it should have been replaced under warranty.If your 3rd charger had the same fate and it too was a genuine Dell charger, again, you could have had it replaced under warranty.​At the moment, the genuine OEM 130W Dell charger is on sale for USD$71.99 which is a good deal for a charger that should work well and has a 12 month warranty.https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-usb-c-130-w-ac-adapter-with-1meter-power-cord-united-states/apd/450-ahom/pc-accessoriesIn my part of the world, it's twice that price so that's a bargain from where I am.HTH.[–]OdyDggy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(2 children)Because it broke right after the warranty expired just my luck....My first broke after a year, then I bought a counterfeit coz the chargers were going for 100$ at that point...

I am unable to proceed beyond the DELL boot log with RST disabled even after an RTC reset. Not sure I can do a clean install of even Windows in this state.I've looked at your previous post. The only thing I'm uncertain about is what your dual boot setup is supposed to be like. Is it:If it's the first one, then what you should do is get a Linux distro. which supports installing and booting with RAID mode on. I believe Redhat and a few others work with it. This will stop you having to \"fight\" the BIOS and Windows.If it's the second then it might be better to disconnect the Windows drive, change the mode from RAID to AHCI, install Linux on the second drive, get it to boot correctly, and then reconnect the Windows drive. At this point, you might have to turn RAID back on to boot up Windows (and perhaps change it to AHCI to boot up Linux).I am assuming you do not want to re-install Windows (so it will be left with it requiring RAID mode).HTH.[–]tamudude[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(1 child)Thanks for your reply. My current setup has one boot drive and one data drive. I want to partition the boot drive and setup Linux on the second partition i.e. the first option you listed.I appreciate the pointer about a Linux that works with RAID. I will look into it. I am assuming you do not want to re-install Windows (so it will be left with it requiring RAID mode).My issue is if I change RAID to AHCI, the computer does not progress beyond initial boot screen. Not sure how I can do a reinstall of Windows if it will not even go past that.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(0 children)My issue is if I change RAID to AHCI, the computer does not progress beyond initial boot screen. Not sure how I can do a reinstall of Windows if it will not even go past that.I've never done it but I think it is possible. You should probably search for posts in r/Dell, r/XPS and r/DellXPS on how to do it and what to expect if you do so.However, if you go down that route, then you might have to struggle a bit (this is what I meant by \"fighting\" the BIOS and OS) to get everything to play nicely. For some reason, Dell systems are set up to expect RAID mode and most users just leave it alone and avoid the \"fight\". Again, there are posts about this so search for them.HTH.\n",

Select diagnostics and cancel the tests.  There should be a Configuration tab up top, click it and scroll down until you find the battery information.  What you're looking for is a number of charge cycles.  If it's a low number (less than 100) then the best course of action would be to fully charge the computer, boot Windows and turn off the critical battery actions and run it until it shuts off.  Otherwise, if the number is a high number (above 300) the battery is already past its useful life.It might be a calibration issue with the Battery Management System, but the battery is also a 4 cell.  2 sets of series in parallel.  If one cell is bad the system will still power with two cells but it will not be stable.I would also take apart the case and see if the battery is original.  If it is not, replace it regardless.[–]Glum_Butterscotch757[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(3 children)Update: The battery is indeed original, and with a couple charge and discharge cycles, increasing 4wh every cycle. the battery is now reading 20wh out of 60wh.

      "content of comments: (12 children)There's nothing wrong. It's behaving the way it should. Please read up on Windows Fast Startup:https://www.howtogeek.com/243901/the-pros-and-cons-of-windows-10s-fast-startup-mode/In a nutshell: the PC is now doing a full shutdown when you \"shut down\", and a full startup when you power it on (meaning that it has to enumerate hardware and load drivers - that takes time). Fast startup avoids those time costs by saving the kernel/driver state upon shutdown and restoring it upon powerup.HTH.[–]StudyingOcelot[S] 1 point2 points3 points 11 days ago(0 children)Thank you! I only asked because I'd read disabling start up adds at most a few seconds, whereas in my case its adding 90 seconds.[–]IkouyDaBolt 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago(10 children)1 and a half minutes is very abnormal.  Between my Optiplexes and my Panasonic tablets turning on and off the feature has roughly the same amount of time for 6th generation Intel processors.If it's 90 seconds until they reach the desktop it may be a corrupted user profile.  If it's 90 seconds until the system reaches idle I would check the Task Manager to see what process is hogging the CPU (as many of my slower systems can take minutes to idle but still reach the desktop within reason).Also, knowing how much RAM is installed might shed some light on the situation./u/StudyingOcelot[–]StudyingOcelot[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(9 children)Thanks for responding!I have an XPS 9710 with an i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB HDD. It has Windows 11 installed (I didn't do a clean installed). I removed some bloatware (including McAfee), then updated all drivers via Dell command. Also have Dell power manager installed to keep the battery charged between 50-70. All unnecessary programs are disabled in startup. I did install explorerpatcher though, for 3 uses (start menu, right click menu, never combine buttons on taskbar). And lastly, I have a WD19TBS dock through which everything is routed (2 monitors, external keyboard and mouse, 2 external HDDs).With fast start up enabled, the time from pressing the on switch to having my desktop loaded is 16-17 seconds. With it disabled, its 1 minute and 45 seconds. I've checked the task manager and performance tabs, and nothing is hogging the CPU or RAM. Bios time is 8.2 seconds with or without fast startup enabled. The difference is that the dell logo is on my screen for much longer with fast startup disabled. (I think this is when its loading windows and drivers?)[–]IkouyDaBolt 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(8 children)I must have misread the original post, as you mentioned having an SSD.  If it is a mechanical 1TB HDD, then it is a completely different ballgame.Fast Startup is the equivalent of hibernation.  When you shut down the computer it copies all what you have in memory (or rather, what is all in memory not assigned to all user accounts) to your hard drive.  Your shut down time is a bit longer with Fast Startup on.  When you turn on the computer, the computer reads the hibernation file as it boots up.  Since it's typically one long continuous file the mechanical hard drive has no issues with it.  When you do a boot without Fast Startup it has to load every single program and file manually which takes time as newer hard drives have lesser performance in order to fit the newer ultrabook size chassis.  90 seconds with a mechanical HDD is normal, even more so if the computer shipped with 21H2 and was upgraded to 22H2.That is correct.  The Dell boot logo is also used when booting Windows.[–]StudyingOcelot[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(7 children)Oops, I'm so sorry, its a 1TB SSD. Can't believe I made that error and wasted your time. Sorry!I understand your explanation about what fast startup and hibernation is. However, my understanding is that with an SSD (mine is gen 3, I think PC711 or something) disabling fast startup should at most add a few seconds to startup time. I'm surprised because it goes from 17 seconds to 1 minute and 45 seconds.\n",

Absolutely perfect, beautiful, and he loves the machine.Buy it, no doubt!Only thing is; pay attention to the screen resolution; you might want to reconsider getting the touch, only because it is higher-resolution.I'm not sure if the non-touch models support lower output resolution, if you ever wanted to connect an external monitor; docking station; etc.Just be mindful of that. Look at the maximum video output resolution before you decide....Or ask Dell. :-)\n",

      "content: as titled i wanted to upgrade the ssd of my dell xps 13 9320 to a larger + faster model, so i purchased and installed a western digital black 4tb nvme ssd. after installing the new ssd, the machine boots perfectly, but the haptic trackpad no longer works correctly. it behaves almost as if one of the buttons is now permanently depressed / clicked; the cursor will highlight all the desktop icons as i try to move the cursor, and it displays the little selection rectangle when i am not clicking buttons / pressing on the pad, but merely swiping my finger around to move the cursor. not sure if it matters but the new ssd is double-sided, whereas the oem (ironically was also western digital!) was single-sided. it seems to fit a bit more snugly in there, that’s for sure… i used macrium reflect to clone the old ssd onto the new one. eta: the reason i mention this is; obviously the xps is a very slim laptop. it seems the double-sided ssd might not allow the bottom cover to fully & completely re-seat / snap in. i'm still researching & working with it, but i could very well see the added thickness of the double vs. single-sided ssd interfering with some of the plastic hooks / snaps that help seat the bottom cover. i'm not sure if that could have any impact on the touchpad; helping keep the cables seated; if there is some capacitive connector that needs to be connected for the touchpad to work (almost like apple's smart connector), etc. i don't know what i don't know, so i am mentioning what has changed. anyhow; after cloning & installing the new 4tb wd black 850x ssd, the machine booted right up perfectly, zero issues with the new drive after the clone. i was thrilled! that said; the physical ssd install itself was very simple and easy as you can see here in the service manual i followed, but when i put it all back together the touchpad no longer works normally. service manual: https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-13-9320-laptop/xps-13-9320-service-manual/working-inside-your-computer?guid=guid-dd3ae169-a824-4f1d-832e-585b176f6faf&lang=en-us the touchpad does kind of work, but it acts like one of the buttons is stuck, as the cursor just selects everything as i move it around, just like if you were holding down one of the buttons / clicking & dragging. i have already uninstalled & reinstalled the driver; no luck. i have also disconnected & firmly re-seated the touchpad cable, as identified in the service manual; no help. i just got a $75 ifixit tool kit, so i’ve got the proper equipment to carefully disconnect / re-connect those tiny little ribbon cables / connectors… when i boot into the bios, the touchpad does seem to work normally when moving around in the bios, so that’s encouraging. any ideas?\n",

Not only said by the sticker but also confirmed by me when trying to charge the iPad with Dell’s charger.The PD revision that was available when Dell started manufacturing these chargers was up to 100w (20v@5A), so in order to do up to 130w Dell had to go out of the PD spec.I’ve heard mixed opinions about Ugreen, but I guess I might give it a shot.[–]like-my-commentXPS Help 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago*(1 child)Maybe it's not full implementation of PD or older standard or ..., I don't have the original 130w charger nearby, so can't check.But I charge my XPS 13 9300 (original charger is 45w) and Latitude 5421 (130w too) just fine.

However, Dell uses a non-standard charger in order to achieve 130w through USB-C, and even with some 100w PD chargers their laptops can only charge at 60w.[–]jc1luv 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago(0 children)Got ya.

I didn't apply a lot of pressure because it should just rest into place but that probably broke it. The Display cable is pretty cheap as it's just that one cable, however it's attached to the display itself and isn't modular. If it's possible to repair it, I would be more than comfortable trying to replace it. It's most likely the scratched cable which sucks. The cable has some kind of protection, so you would think a plastic clamp scratching the surface wouldn't cause any damage to the cable but here I am.The cable itself is fully connected and when I disconnect it, the BIOS recognizes that it's disconnected. So, it can detect it? But I assume the part that's scratched is enough to prevent the actual touch screen from receiving any input. If all else fails, hey the computer still works and looks great.

      "content of comments: (3 children)Laptop wise, I wouldn't go with the xps. For better quality, go with the precision line. A 7k series, like a 7540-7560, has enough expansion slots to go the distance. 4 ram and 3 ssd slots. Even a used one should go at least a good 10 years. For something more affordable, the latitude 5420 is a nice machine. Can upgrade the ram and storage.[–]paranoid_365[S] 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago(2 children)Thank you for the fast reply, and the advice bc I REALLY need it. I was looking @ those other models, but again it seems like they have a bunch of models with the diffrences being the slightest changes. I was pretty interested in the precision line bc like you said it's very well rounded, and the expansion options are great. I was also looking @ the latitude 5420, but again there's still approx. 5 models. I am definitely looking for longevity, especially @ some of these prices, lol. Out of pure curiosity is there a reason you don't recommend the XPS series, bc I don't know to much about XPS or dell in general. Also, quickly are dell refurbs from dell worth it @ all, especially quality/longterm bc a person could save a good chunk of money? Thanks again in advance![–]jc1luv 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago(1 child)No worries, the 5420 will only differ on your processor, maybe screen type but everything else should be the same.. if you plan to keep long term, get a processor and screen you'd be comfortable with. Ram and ssd you can get basic because you upgrade that.We don't use the XPS machines but we use the precisions based on that se chasis. So in my opinion if you're getting an xps, better to get a precision as those are better tuned. The xps/precision chasis are not as upgradable. Might have a single ssd slot and only dual ram slots, just like the latitude. But if you're getting a precision, it just makes sense to spend a bit more on a 7k series as those are the real upgradable ones. So those will go the distance.[–]EquinoxOV 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago(0 children)Those are really really expensive though, 95% of people don’t need the power of a precision line computer because it’s a business machine. XPS 15 can deliver great performance for much less cost than a precision laptop.[–]Haunting-Guest-3823 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago*(0 children)First question.  What are you doing with the laptop? The Precision's are mobile workstations.  They are usually over the top unless you need the power to do CAD or heavy video editing.  The XPS line is geared for office apps, but can be used for mid range gaming and Adobe work.  I use a 5 yr old XPS, it has 32GB ram, and a 1TB m2 drive, 7hrs of battery.

With that said, I'd advice against ECC RAM unless you specifically need it for your applications. From my understanding, ECC runs slower than regular ram, does have error protections but if you're trying to get best performance from your rig, ECC or Xeons won't be your best choices.In general, if you're applications do not ask for ECC RAM specifically, I'd say don't even worry about.\n",

I was merely stating that 90% SoC is still way too high.  It's a good compromise for those that use AC a lot and battery power, but even if the battery doesn't swell after a year or two the battery's capacity might not be optimal.It really depends on the device, but that has not been the case on devices such as WD wireless hard drives.  The fact that not keeping it fully charged resolves the issue has nothing to do with manufacturing quality.  As lithium polymer degrades it produces gasses which causes the cells to balloon up.  There are other reasons (heat, overdischarge) that it can happen but most Battery Management Systems put the battery at 100% SoC which gives very little room for fluctuations.I can't say I've used notebooks on AC power extensively, but I only have a handful that use polymer packs, everything else is 18650 which does not have the capability to swell.  There's also the other issue; if you have a laptop plugged in for a couple of years does the battery still hold a reasonable charge?[–]jakubkonecki 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago(1 child)Of course it does. I have laptops plugged in for years and the battery is fine. Laptop will not constantly charge the battery but trickle charge when necessary. No suspicious loss of capacity.\n",

Maybe there's a driver that won't work or is not available (however, the Dell Support website offers Windows 11 drivers for your machine).If you have a spare hard drive, you could try installing Win11 on it and seeing if it has problems.Also, there might be more information in the update tool which states why it won't let you upgrade. If so, you might be able to solve whatever it is.HTH.\n",

Because those are using a separate USB \"device\", it's a separate driver and doesn't use MaxxAudio, and the sound quality is untainted.

It's a bit of a system-wide advanced EQ with a bunch of other options so the learning curve will be a bit.  First, install the driver that you want to keep, and make sure \"audio enhancements\" is turned off as usual. My Precision does have MaxxAudio, but rarely play anything through the laptop speakers.  This works awesome with my bluetooth headphones but don't see a reason why it wouldn't work with MaxxAudio (speakers and headphone jack)[–]drumsandguitar[S] 0 points1 point2 points 18 days ago(2 children)Thanks for the suggestion. When using the Realtek drivers and MaxxAudio, I'm unfortunately unable to turn off audio enhancements, or sound stops completely. And when using those drivers, Equalizer APO has no effect at all (no matter how I install it), sadly.I also tried using Equalizer APO with the Microsoft audio driver, but unfortunately the built-in speakers can't really be redeemed with that one, even when EQing, since low frequencies aren't produced by the built-in speakers whatsoever (and boosting them just ends up clipping the sound but not changing the amount of bass produced). Must be a laptop/driver nuance that prevents it from behaving with MaxxAudio, but I'd definitely hoped it would work.[–]TooModestM5530 Precision 2-in-1 4K and WD19TB 0 points1 point2 points 18 days ago(1 child)Ah what a pain.

(dell technical support says they'll let me exchange the laptop for a new one since, but i have very little confidence that a new one will be any different.)

This prevents the accidental use of driver on the wrong operating system.For you to use Windows 10 on the 9315, all of the drivers necessary to operate the hardware in the 9513 need to be available for Windows 10. You might be able to get those drivers from Dell or you might have to get some from elsewhere. If you cannot get a driver, you won't be able to use that hardware under Windows 10 (or maybe with degraded functionality or performance).Considering the problems and risks with getting the right drivers and the fact that Dell will not support Windows 10 on the 9513, I would not install Windows 10.If you do want to try it anyway, either partition your hard drive to create another partition into which you can install Win10, or install it on an external drive and use that as a testbed to see what issues you might run into (without losing your Win11 installation). Since these require some technical knowledge about disks and installation, it might not be suitable for you.You don't mention why you want to use Windows 10.

But it's Just a workaround. If u have it, and it's very likely that u have it, the HDR disabled, because it's like that by default. Then u are probably, very likely facing the same issue. Pixels or group of Pixels jumping all around. And it's not a unique problem, like i said this one is the Exchange unit. If u enable the HDR Option the Issue is over and all is functioning like it should, no pixel \"jumping\" whatsoever.

(I'm assuming you're using Windows.) On Linux there are entries in the /sys filesystem that report this. Depending on your use patterns your battery may be about done.And FWIW, Dell also provides tools to limit battery charge levels. I limit mine to 65% when I'm on A/C for extended periods and bump it up to 95% if I plan to be on battery for a while. Battery health has dropped from 95% (new) to 93% (current) in about 3 years.[–]jc1luv 2 points3 points4 points 21 days ago(0 children)Error code indicates a faulty battery. Couple ways to diagnose this. Also know batteries older than 3 years old are more likely to require service.\n",
      "1. If you turn off your laptop. Turn it back on while pressing F2. That will take you into the bios and in there you can see battery health.

I would open it up and check connections and the general state of the battery and test if you have this issue with the case open. If you have ever spilled liquid on the machine it could be corrosion too.Also not sure if it's due to shutter speeds on your camera or if you can see it in real life too but normally the keyboard doesn't blink either[–]Escles 2 points3 points4 points 22 days ago(0 children)Just to add you could have been blessed with a bad battery or just not taken care of it very well. There are many reasons a lithium battery degrades like heat, cold, constant trickle charge (very common in offices and home users that never take their laptops anywhere) or fully depleting it. A battery is a consumable and you only get a long lifespan if you treat it well. You can use Dell power manager or change settings in the bios to customize how and when it charges.\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)Hi friend! If you're specs mention you can upgrade to 64GB, then yes! its possible to run a single stick on either slot. You can run a  single 8, 16, or 32gb stick if supported. Being the same mhz, you can run a combination. So if you're current setup is dual 8gb, you can keep one and add 32gb for a total of 40gb. Or run the 16gb and add a 32gb for a total of 48gb! You should be fine that way as long as the speed matches so your machine can perform to the max.Im wondering if your workflow requires that much ram. Honestly 16gb is plenty, and 32gb is overkill unless a program you use requires it. I run 32GB on a 7540 that does our 4K video editing on premiere pro and I never seen it go past 16gb use.Good luck friend![–]The_Alaska_ShibeXPS 15 9570 i7 16GB/512GB 1050Ti 1 point2 points3 points 22 days ago(0 children)Thats an option but last time I checked there is a little wiggle room with ram compatibility for 2 slots, best scenario two sticks that came with the same pack for dual channel or more, second best is two ram sticks from same manufacturer and speed and size, then two different manufactures same speed and so forth until you have mismatching ram speeds[–]Escles 1 point2 points3 points 21 days ago*(0 children)You could but would leave much perf on the table as your memory will run in single channel mode. You only get 2666mHz if you have 2 sticks. A single stick has 2 lanes which each has 1333 mHz and therefore the 2666 mHz only applies if you have 2 as the memory not only has to be able to communicate with the CPU but also between each-other. Which is why it's like that.As someone else mentioned your workflow probably doesn't need this much ram as your machine will also move unsued pages in memory in SWAP. Even though that's slower your machine is unlikely to use more than 16Gb actively and most machines have NVMe nowadays making SWAP pretty quick too. 32Gb might be needed if you also run VM's or work with complicated large data-sets or like to have a million tabs open in Chrome. 64Gb is pretty much overkill and makes for expensive sticks.You can also combine different sizes of sticks that's not really an issue but it's not ideal. Also if your timings are different on the sticks then it will revert to the slowest common denominator.EDIT: Be sure to also check system compatibilty with your machine as it usually works but OEM machines like this can be finnicky and only accept specific vendors or models of sticks.[–]Monkeeboy81[S] 0 points1 point2 points 20 days ago(0 children)Thank you all. \n",

I didn't know this, the radius for the wrap would vary  for each conductor causing uneven stain on the cable, that makes total sense OP's issue is pretty much solved and on the mobo since the charger was already replaced.

If you have pro support it's free otherwise it's gonna cost a pretty penny. Your machine probably comes with it's own charger that is of barrel type as USB-C would not be enough to supply the machine with enough juice (100W is the limit here, up to 240W is available but since yours came with a barrel plug I doubt it's compatible with those) where machines like this usually need more due to the dedicated video card and other components like the 4K screen. You can still charge it via USB-C though (via dock or other charger) it will just be slower to charge depending on the wattage of the charger and if you are running on max perf it will drain the battery even when plugged in because it consumes more than it's getting. Atleast you can still use it this way though.EDIT; looked at some photos of this machine and indeed the plug is directly on the motherboard and not on it's own daughterboard. If you have soldering skills or know someone who has you can just replace that piece instead which is way cheaper. But you will also have to dismantle pretty much the entire machine (although still not as bad as replacing a keyboard).You can also use the built in diagnostics feature using F12 when booting (press F12 when you see the Dell logo), from there you can see exactly how much charge it's recieving and if it's recognizes the charger correctly (if you have any current flow and how much, negative current flow means it's running on battery).[–]JustSaiyan15[S] 0 points1 point2 points 22 days ago(6 children)So I had run diagnostics but I’m not sure how to add photos on here.

I've been busy with work and Xmas, but I've finally set it up as dual-boot Kubuntu 22.04/Win11 box. I've been slowly loading relevant parts from my 7390 to this machine, and haven't gotten around to building a bleeding-edge kernel yet, but it's been encouraging- with the stock Kubuntu kernel (5.15.0-56-generic #62-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 22 19:54:14 UTC 2022) I'm not seeing measurably different standby discharge times from S3; that being said I need more time with it in Linux mode.BUT, what was really encouraging was before I'd set up the dual-boot, Windows 11 was suspended for some three days and dropped to only ~98%- so it appears the hardware is at least capable of good Modern Suspend/s0ix standby times. I can't wait to get a custom bleeding-edge kernel ginned up and running (I need to craft a _defconfig specifically for this hardware, and it's starting to look like I'll have to switch to using Ubuntu's kernel git tree overlaid on top of Linus' master to get the most out of some of the hardware, and I just don't have the cycles RN).[–]brosenz[S] 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago(0 children)Thank you, please keep us posted[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(2 children)I was thinking on getting the 32GB model, but I use Hibernation a lot to avoid battery drainage, saving and resuming 32GB of data will take double the time, than 16GB, that's the reason I got it with 16GB, and for Ubuntu is plenty of memory.[–]hereforthepixXPS 7390 2-in-1 32G/1TB/FHD 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(1 child)Understood- but FWIW I always try and get 32GB (I'm a dev and also run VMs sometimes) and have the system set to \"Sleep + Hibernate\", only going into Hibernate if the battery is low or it's been 3 days- resume, while much slower, has only taken me ~15 seconds (and should be even faster now with the Gen4 NVMe in the 9320 vs the Gen3 in the 7390).[–]brosenz[S] 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(1 child)Side topic, what is your experience with the Outlet?

I’ve seen things play up if left in a close-to freezing car overnight[–]Escles 0 points1 point2 points 22 days ago*(0 children)Batteries (Lithium type) don't like cold, charging to full or fully discharging, all of those reduce the span of the battery. Ideally you would avoid very cold scenarios (under 10 degrees I would say). Also if you don't to quickcharge then  disable the feature as it will also work the battery very hard. Many phones have it on by default now but is really not ideal unless you really need the quick fix. Say you plug your phone and go to bed it's better to charge over a 3h period than use QC. I try and use wireless charging specifically for this so it's gentle on the battery since wireless charging is usually limited to low charge rates.  You can also modify your charge preferences in bios or with Dell power manager application and limit it to for example 95% charge and stop there. This will also help perserve the battery as the more it's charged the higher the impedence will get and it costs more to add that extra bit of juice.   The anology I use to explain is one of a balloon, in the beggining it's easy to inflate but it gets harder and harder as you push more air into it.[–]Escles 0 points1 point2 points 22 days ago(1 child)Sounds like it's not able to handshake correctly. When you plug a device it starts a handshake procedure and steps up the Voltage and Wattage if succesfull. Have you also checked that your phone can still fast-charge if it has this feature? If it could before and no longer can that would mean it's using the default which is 2 amps max on 5V.[–]smorrier[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)Sorry for the late reply.

If the CPU/GPU is at 100% then there's not much you can do.  If the memory usage is above 90%, then more memory should be in order, etc.  8GB of RAM is OK, but 16GB or more might be useful.

The only Dell software I installed afterwards was My Dell because the power settings are integrated into that app now, and I had to install the Killer software and then disable it to fix a weird problem where some sites wouldn't work for 5-10 minutes after waking from sleep (weird but it worked). The audio software did install but I didn't have to change anything, audio works great now and will switch to headphones via BT or aux from my USB soundbar or internal speakers.Fixed virtually all of my issues and I just let WU serve me updated Dell drivers.I have a love/hate relationship with these. I think the hardware and aesthetics are the best combo for me, but the software configuration from the manufacturer is awful.

I'm using my laptop mostly connected through the Dell WD19TB dock and connect/disconnect it a few times per day. I haven't experienced any issues related to sleep/wake and an external monitor.Actually, the only notable issue I have is related to the dock and its buggy firmware.

      "content: context on the heels of a dying gaming laptop, and after mulling it over for a year, i decided to bite the bullet back in july and purchase a dell xps 9520 (15 inch, 32gb ram, nvidia rtx 3050 ti), both for regular home use, as well as professional use (as i work almost exclusively from home). i'm a software developer who neededed the extra ram for work. purchasing this laptop is one of the worst decisions i have ever made. whilst it's quite a solid piece of hardware with nice build quality, the driver support is just absolutely awful. i have had so many small nagging issues so frequently that it has marred my entire experience with this laptop from day 1. the laptop came with windows 11, which i suspect is responsible (alongside dell's horrible drivers) for at least some of the issues i experience. tldr - anyone looking to buy this laptop who intends to use aux audio output should be very, very wary. audio the primary problem i've had with this laptop is the audio. i have had so many persistent and disruptive issues with it that i'm now at a lose about what to do with this laptop. the audio seems to lean off a horrible piece of bloatware called \"maxxaudiopro\" which is annoying, obnoxious, and by default applies unwanted \"enhancement\" effects to the output. unfortunately, without maxxaudiopro, the laptop can't recognize when headphones have been plugged in. for many months i experienced a consistent issue whereby everytime i connected a usb audio output source (a small dac for music), the laptop would refuse to output audio via speakers or aux until i restarted. even after disconnecting the dac, i'd be unable to get audio through another output source without a restart. some research led me to remove the realtek hd audio driver and instead use microsoft's default hd audio drivers to fix this issue. but since then i've experienced similar random occasional instances of being unable to get audio via earphones without a restart, or being unable to get speaker audio after connecting/disconnecting earphones without a restart, or just flat out losing audio altogether and needing a restart. these happen intermittently and quite frequently, forcing me to restart numerous times throughout any given week, and often interrupting work calls. last week, aux audio output stopped working altogether, prompting me to contact dell support. after following their instructions and installing the latest windows update and audio drivers from dell's website, the speaker audio also stopped working. i since discovered that i had to set the \"audio enhancements\" setting in windows sound settings to \"default effects\" to regain audio. switching \"enhancements\" off results in no audio at all. however, since the dell support incident, the audio quality out of the laptop has been utterly abysmal. muffled, distorted and with a noticeable echo effect. i've been completely unable to fix this issue, despite numerous attempts. i've gone through several rounds of uninstalling/reinstalling all the audio drivers and software from dell's website, and attempted other audio drivers from realtek/intel, with varying results: lost audio completely at one stage. interestingly the windows startup sounds still worked. got audio back without forced \"enhancement effects\" but with almost inaudibly low max volume. fixed audio quality for aux port, but speakers only outputted one volume (max volume) regardless of what the volume meter was set to. aux volume selection worked fine. after more uninstalls/reinstalls of the dell driver, i'm now back where i was after dell support's \"help\", with clearly malfunctioning and distorted audio quality coming from all output sources, and no audio at all if i switch \"auidio enhancements\" off. a brief search on these issues has turned up numerous results (for each), ranging from years old to recent. it seems i'm not alone in encountering persistent issues with dell's audio drivers, and not alone in my revulsion of maxxaudiopro, which these laptops are shackled to. i'm baffled that for nearly $4000 aud, i've received a product that can't functionally provide something as basic as audio. i don't know why dell, after so many years of community issues, can't seem to produce reliable audio drivers. these issues have driven me nearly insane, and constantly interrupt me on a daily basis during work calls and meetings. other issues below i will list, in no particular order, and by no means exhaustively, a smattering of the menagerie of other problems i have had with this laptop: when i wake the laptop from sleep and it's connected to an external display, both displays will experience substantial lag. the solution is to unplug the external display, unplug the charger, and plug both back in. this happens frequently (but not always). occasionally the laptop won't charge when the charger and an external display are plugged in. the solution is again....unplug both, reconnect the charger, then the external display. dell's power management software is broken. the \"always ac\" mode is supposed to stop charging at 80% to preserve battery life. it doesn't. i had to set a custom 50% - 80% setting, which works chaotically. the laptop randomly starts/stops charging anywhere in that range, and sometimes just hovers at a random value (55%, 70%, 75% etc.). it's completely unreliable and requires babysitting, which defeats the entire purpose of the utility even existing. in the 6 months i've owned this laptop, i've had two forced bios updates.\n",

      "content of comments: (1 child)Not sure if this is your issue but some tables just seem to output lower as time goes on. How old is it? I have to replace my phone charger every few weeks. I'll put in a brand new one, it will work perfectly and charge super fast for a week or two, then I begin getting \"Charging slow, please connect the charger that came with your device\" initially once a day or so but eventually I will get the pop-up once every few seconds until I cave and get a new cable. This has happened with at least 30 cables including the OEM one. I don't usually keep laptops long enough for the cable to go bad but would assume that they don't last forever either. Probably the wires developing resistance little by little until hardly any amps are being pumped through. Resistance can develop due to small breaks, overheating through time and I can't remember what else.

You can use msconfig to set the default device to boot up with so both of them can have Windows on it.When you get the SSD, you can also transfer (copy) your current Windows to the new SSD to save you the trouble of installing from scratch (of course you could clean install if you prefer). Most SSD manufacturers include access to a downloadable utility which can transfer the boot system.will there be any real benefit on replacing the gen 3 ssd with a gen 4 one? probably not. Only if you read or write a lot of data will the performance be noticeable. For example, playing a AAA game with large textures, or transcoding a large video, or building a blu-ray video image file.

      "content of comments: (1 child)You don't mention which update app you're using. It could be SupportAssist or \"Dell update\".If it's the Dell update app and it's telling you that only the BIOS needs updating, then you're probably up to date with the other drivers (ie, they were successfully installed). Click System Information in the app to see the installed drivers. You can use that list to check against what the Dell Support website says is the latest versions (click \"This PC\" then \"Drivers and Downloads\").If it's SupportAssist then go to the History tab and you should see what was recently installed (or not). Again, you can check against the list on the Dell Support website to see if there are out of date drivers.HTH.[–]Reniw[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Thanks.

Yes I can imagine oled one even with lower 400 but can be brighter than fhd (but say cost of battery).

(feels like a dumb question but gotta check my stupidity when considering things i don't normally consider~) i'm kind of surprised the oled and fhd options have such a big resolution difference. my main use is within windows terminal, though i can avoid using the display when not travelling a lot since i have an external monitor. also, for oled, a lot of people hide the taskbar to avoid possible burn in. what about the top menu/tab bar in most applications? the only thing i found was dark mode to change the top bar color. i can't seem to google much on that, most ppl just mention taskbar. thanks in advance!\n",

      "content of comments: (3 children)Dell provides online manuals for their machines so you should learn how to search for them.Your machine's manual details what SSDs you can install:https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-13-9310-laptop/xps-13-9310-setup-and-specifications/storage?guid=guid-a00459e0-2a64-449c-9f02-581bf2e3c2cf&lang=en-usand gives you the answer: \"M.2 2280 solid-state drive, PCIe Gen3 x4 NVMe, up to 32 Gbps, up to 2 TB\"Since the 980 Pro is a PCIe 4 SSD, it will work but it won't perform at its fastest speed. The 980 is a PCIe 3 SSD so it will match the laptop's M.2 slot's capability and perform at its fastest speed.HTH.[–]Ascaris5 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago(2 children)The 9310 has a PCIe gen 4 slot. Dell just doesn't populate it with a gen 4 drive. I have one, and it definitely will read and write into the 6-7000 MB/s range on benchmarks. I was fooled too, as I initially bought a gen 3 drive for it, thinking the extra $20 for the gen 4 would be wasted.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(1 child)OK. Thanks for the information. I'm happy to be corrected but it's going to fool a lot of 9310 owners who will believe otherwise because Dell has wrong documentation. 🙄[–]Ascaris5 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(0 children)Yeah, I was one of them!My XPS 9310 (non touch, 1920x1200, i5-1135G7, 16GB, \"Developer edition\" with Linux, custom ordered from Dell) came with a small (250GB I think) SSD, and I did not want to pay the Dell markup for a bigger one (and where they would select which one I got).\n",
      "I swapped the included drive for a SK Hynix P31 Gold (PCIe 3x4), 1TB, which was the biggest SK Hynix offered at the time. I chose the P31 for its low power consumption. Later, when the 2TB model became available, I saw that SK Hynix also had a P41 Platinum model that was PCIe 4x4. I bought the 2TB P31 to save a few dollars... why pay more for performance I can't use?\n",
      "The 1TB SK Hynix was then handed down to my Dell G3 (3579) gaming laptop.Since then, I bought another laptop (that I didn't really need, since I have the XPS), an Adata XPG Xenia 14, that was advertised as being PCIe 4 capable on NVMe, and for that laptop (which also came with a smallish drive) I bought the SK Hynix Platinum P41 2 TB. Then I read where someone else commented about the XPS 9310 possibly being able to use a 4x4 drive at its rated speed, since the 11th gen Tiger Lake should be able to do PCIe 4, and there would be no reason for Dell to deliberately cripple their flagship ultrabook, so I swapped the P41 into the XPS to test it. Sure enough, it benchmarks just as fast as in the laptop that was advertised as using PCIe 4 x4. It's around 7000 MB/s sequential read and ~6000 MB/s sequential write, about double what it got with the P31 (as expected).This is kind of silly of Dell; they have a feature that could have been used to sell more XPSs (when the 9310 was current) and they hide it behind PCIe 3x4 drives and don't tell anyone about it![–]MidwestGeek52 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Do know the form factor needed? You can start by going to Crucial System Scanner and running it. It'll report on compatible Crucial disks  Will tell you the form factor needed. Typically only the form factor matters - but you could post what Crucial says and post if another vendor you have in mind would also work.\n",

(cant say anything about the 4k model)if you need to make zoom calls, the webcam placement is actually really annoying.keyboard is fine, and the os depends on what you're using but i doubt you can upgrade to windows 11 since i believe the cutoff is 8th gen intel. trackpad is great.my laptop sometimes gets loud cause fans randomly spin, but it doesn't bother me at all.your USB-c port might be restricted in terms of power transfer and transfer speeds. I'm not sure how, but i know the 9570 got an upgrade to that. you might want to look into that.overall i probably wont upgrade this laptop until it dies since it works perfectly fine for what i use it for. however, do note that my use cases are quite light (web browsing, emails, school work) and for anything that requires strong processing power, i use my desktop.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)its to be in perfect conditions and i would assume an already old laptop like that will not start to get random errorrs at this point, right?you should assume the worst.

      "content: hello everyone, i purchased an xps 17 9710 in january 2020 and just after 1 week of use i entered the uefi bios (version 1.6.0) and changed some settings, nothing serious just the keyboard backlight and battery settings. after restart, the pc won´t pass dell logo (no post) as dell call it. and the status light in the front of the laptop flashed 2 times amber and 8 times white. started to research on it and found out that according to dell \"display failure - ec detection of power rail failure\". dell support team troubleshooted the device and then advice for a motherboard replacement due to the that power rail failure. a month later i received my device and entered bios... i was in real disbelief when again the same happened, and again the motherboard was replaced. after the second replacement i updated the uefi bios firmware to the latest version and as my warranty is running out, i contacted dell to talk about this. the support agent ran a couple of test on my computer and advised to enter the boot menu and run an extensive diagnostic on the machine. every test passed without any issues, and from that same boot menu screen i entered the bios once again almost 1 year after the 2° mobo replacement. it went ok, i just browsed through the options without making any change whatsoever. i do not have the confidence to make any changes to a bios setting even with the latest firmware. the laptop has been working flawlessly, i just don´t want to lose my pc for 1 month again while dell issues a replacement for me. do anyone has had this issue? could you please confirm if recent bios firmware do not compromise the power rail as it happened twice to me? any help would be appreciated.\n",

      "content of comments: (1 child)In my opinion the XPS will perform better for your use case than the Zephyrus. \n",
      "The Zephyrus will run rings around the XPS in sheer performance as it comes with much more powerful hardware and the cooling system vastly superior to that of the XPS. Dependent on what games you’re looking to play as well as how intensive your dev work is, Zephyrus wins for performance.The extra performance of the Zephyrus will hurt battery life and both machines have a similar battery capacity (90Wh for Zephyrus, 86 for the XPS). From experience with my 9510 I get about 6-8 hours depending on use (but that’s with it going into low power mode below 50% battery and running the 4k screen at 1200p on battery)I think for software dev the XPS also wins on the keyboard alone, large trackpad is nice and accurate for on the go use without a mouse and it’s quite compact thanks to the thin bezels so can fit ok on public transport and stuff. Obviously I’m slightly biased from owning an XPS and never used the ASUS but I feel the XPS will just fit your needs better.[–]abstart 1 point2 points3 points 14 hours ago(0 children)I do 90% work (including game programming) and 10% gaming and my solution is a proper desktop for work and gaming, and the xps 15 for real laptop needs and work on the go, and occasional gaming if needed. The windows laptops have bad battery life and to me it defeats the purpose to get a heavy machine like the zephyrus. It's a laptop. It should be highly portable and have good battery. Also I went for the non oled non 4k screen for same reasons.

The Dell cooling system isn’t adequate enough for the components and it will get hot and throttle back but it won’t “melt” the fans or “fry the board”[–]Fartlord2099 -4 points-3 points-2 points 10 hours ago(8 children)It’s not a take both of those have happened. The fans are not enough to cool the components, so the board burns out. Since the unit is super compact and the fans blades are made of PLASTIC and the fact that internal temps can easily run over 200 F, the fans will melt after prolonged use. It won’t happen instantly but it will happen. My xps 9500 gpu died after two years just from playing fortnite a few hours every other day. The vents were clear. Board still died. My replacement 9520 just had the fans replaced because one of them started to make a chugging sound. The tech confirmed the fan  blades were warped aka THEY MELTED. Next time maybe shut the fuck up before talking about something you don’t know about. If you want to game, get another machine.[–]Techo238 -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours ago(7 children)Your immediate response to start flaming confirms to me that you have no idea what you’re talking about. Just because your processor or GPU hit above 200F doesn’t mean your the cooler is reaching anywhere near that temperature since that’s read from sensors located on the board with the processor and the fans themselves are located a fair distance away from the processor itself it’s highly unlikely the fans were damaged by the heat in the system. More likely is the fan blades had a manufacturing defect to begin with which wasn’t caught by dell’s laughably poor QA or potentially some particularly sturdy bit of debris made it’s way into the cooler and damaged the fans. The noise the fans could have caused by debris lodged in them somewhere or potentially a dodgy/improperly lubricated fan bearing but I seriously doubt this was caused by heat. I will admit that my comment it’s not impossible for the “board to fry” but it’s also not a hugely likely outcome. Yes, prolonged use of any machine at high temperatures can cause deterioration of system components over time which could lead to a failure particularly if there was maybe a poor thermal paste application or a not fully secured cooler (again, poor QA) but the likelihood of this happening, even in the first 2 years like your case, is rather low. Also I wouldn’t consider this a massive factor since OP specified that they will be doing light gaming and mostly using the machine for work. I’m not saying that this is an outstanding system for gaming or that the cooling system is in any way adequate for the hardware it cools, but your original comment was overly negative and largely useless advice.[–]Fartlord2099 -3 points-2 points-1 points 10 hours ago(6 children)The fan assembly sits right on top of the hottest components you moron.

That being said, I love my 9520 but the asus might be faster especially since it has a higher end video card. I wouldn’t buy it myself because of form factor, the 9520 Is the largest laptop I want.Curious about the battery life question, I don’t do any gaming while unplugged. If I forgot to plug in, then it’s about an hour and a half on a cpu intensive game like civ6 w a ton of mods. Anker makes a tiny wall charger that works excellently with this laptop, 140 watts and I use a ‘15 UNI usb c cable with it.

      "content of comments: (3 children)Well, since you seem to have already ordered it, just see if you like it and if not, send it back.That said: I changed from an XPS 13 to the 15 - I had bought the 13 because I wanted sth ultra portable and eventually switched over to the 15 because the comfort of a larger laptop (screen size, keyboard layout) to me more than makes up for the few extra grams of weight. The laptop has three USB-C ports. I bought a docking station (not the original Dell version) which gives me four standard USB ports, two HDMI, one DP and an Ethernet port.[–]Blinky-B1ll[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(2 children)Ordered but taking a few weeks to fulfil.

Def annoying not to have USB A for travel as that's how my travel mouse works.[–]toniyevych 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago(0 children)I suggest going with a WD19TB dock, which can stay in the office. You may find them used for a reasonable price on eBay. As a bonus, you will be able to use one cable to connect all the devices and charge the laptop.[–]jc1luv 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago(0 children)I don't have use the XPS series but I do have a precision with similar chassis. I use one of the precision 5760, which is a 17 inch version with 4 TB4 ports and the SD card slot. I have to say portability wise, its not terrible. I sometimes carry a 5520, which is a 15 inch, and they feel the same, but it does make a difference if you are used to carrying a 14inch and under laptop. For instance when I Carry around my 5420, its just so much smaller and lighter because its made from some form of plastic while the 5760 is metal allow construct. However it is a much better machine to have.If you use your laptop with accessories, I would suggest just get a dell dock so that everything stays connected. All you need is to connect your xps with the single tb3/4 cable and everything just works. I use both at home and at work and I just plug whichever laptop I have with me without having to worry about plugging every single device.Since Im mostly using the docks, I have zero issues with the lack of USB-As, I hardly use any accessories other than my external ssd/flash drives, but I am already 90% on usb-c for everything possible. If you still rely a ton on usb-a, then just a simple dongle would do for when on the go. Dell included a USB-C to HDMI/USB-A adapter with my laptop but I probably used it twice in 6 months, not sure if its something they send with the XPS.For the XPS you can go with either displayport, tb3, or tb4 docks. Don't really need to go with TB4 on this one unless you want to have the latest one. Currently the WD22TB4 is the newest but its pricey, mine was like $300. Any TB3 should be from $100-200 and it won't make a difference unless you run more than 2 displays.Best of luck[–]parasymchills 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago(0 children)I have this laptop. I probably don't have the same usage pattern as you, but I'll describe my setup and why it works for me.I work most days at home. Once a week, I bring the laptop to the office and work there.At home, I have nothing connected to it except the power adapter which is usually plugged into the USB-C port on the right (the non-Thunderbolt port). This leaves the 2 Thunderbolt ports free in case I need to connect things like external drives, monitors, etc. But 96% of the time, there's nothing connected.At the office, I use the machine differently. It sits on a stand with the power adapter plugged into one of the left side's ports. On the right side, I plug in a $30 USB-C hub which has 3 USB-A ports and 1 HDMI port. A monitor is connected to the hub as well as a keyboard and mouse, leaving one spare USB-A port which occasionally has a USB stick plugged into it.That's it. I don't need anything more like a dock with ethernet or multi-monitor support. I don't consider it port-limited in either location.I transport it (and the power adapter) using a backpack designed for 17\" laptops because I want the extra space for other things (I sometimes need to bring a second laptop so the space is useful). I don't consider it heavy because the weight is borne by my lower back and not my shoulders.As you've pointed out, it is upgradable and that's a very good reason to get it. I've already put in after-market RAM and can add another SSD if the need arises.I have the UHD+ screen but the OLED is good too. If you have PWM sensitivity, you might want to check if the OLED will be a problem.HTH.\n",

You need a CPU to execute the code in the BIOS (the BIOS is partly a program and partly a bunch of data which is used to get the PC to work/boot). You actually don't need RAM to execute the BIOS, but you do need it to boot an operating system.You'll also need something to generate a video signal so you can see something on a display monitor. The graphics card can be built into the CPU, which is called integrated graphics (iGPU), or it can be a video card, which is called discrete graphics (dGPU).If you do insert a CPU (presumably with an iGPU so you can have a video signal) and power it up and the machine can function well enough to display the Dell logo on a screen, press and hold F12 until the one-time boot menu appears. Select diagnostics and let the machine tell you what's working and what's not.If you see some LEDs blinking and get some beeping sounds, then the machine has something wrong with its hardware and you'll need to consult the Service Manual to diagnose the problem.HTH.[–]margarinetailorgreen[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago(0 children)Thank you so much!

Did it not recognize the monitor? Or did you only get half of a display or some weird stuff (if we are talking about an Apple display, they do very weird stuff with custom software to get them to work the way they do on Apple hosts. They might require both TB-tunnels of a TB connection).The Surface Pro 9 should share a single TB4 controller (with only 2 DP total) between both TB4 ports, due to the fact it also offers display outputs on the surface dock connector.The XPS 13 Plus should use 2 distinct TB4 controllers, each offering up to 2 DP connections independently of one another.​Intel only says 4x4K or 1x8K. And if at least one of the monitors exceeds 4K, it might take up so much memory bandwidth, that the total number of monitors is reduced to 3 (or with 8K60 down to 1, although Intel also contradicts itself somewhat here and I do not have 8K displays to test it). Intel does not give exact numbers on when this bandwidth limitation occurs, but I have been able to run 3x4K + 3840x1600@144 (8Bit, almost full, uncompressed HBR3 bandwidth) without problems on the same Xe graphics unit with slower memory. So there is probably enough headroom for 3x4K + 6K. But if the 6K display takes up to DP connections / display pipelines then only 2 other screens will be supported. On the other hand, then there will be more than enough bandwidth left to do it.​Edit: did the math, 1 of Intel's  display pipelines can do 5K60 10b by itself. If the 6K screen is logically a single display, on 8b it should barely fit a single pipeline, but with 10b, it should consume 2 pipelines. If it is represented as 2 separate logical displays, then it will always consume 2 pipelines. So doubtful you could run the 6K + 3 other monitors. 6K + 2x4K exceeds the guarantees Intel makes, but would in practice still work. If anything in runs up against the total amount of memory bandwidth for all monitors. If the monitor is not even recognized, then that would be a driver problem due to the rare resolution etc, that will most likely shared by everything using the same driver.[–]grork[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(1 child)Surface Pro 9 just didn't detect it – likely for the reasons you say vis-a-vis channels. However, the display does support DSC, so shouldn't be quite so constrained -- it doesn't require TB as I've used it with Display Port on a desktop GPU (AMD 5500XT) + Belkin Charge Huawei Glass Cable. (Yes, it's a Pro Display XDR).I'm trying to avoid the 'buy it, return it 15 minutes later when it doesn't work' scenario.For more context: I have a personal MacBook Pro, which I drive 4k+4k+6k off two cables + dock, and it works great. I've been using Windows in a VM, which is great, but I'm trying to get more work/personal separation, and want to switch a dedicated work laptop. I've done the eGPU path before, and it's \"fine\" on the Mac, but my windows experiences with the Surface Pro 9, and a ThinkPad P15S has been flakey at best.[–]rayddit519 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)However, the display does support DSC, so shouldn't be quite so constrainedI am aware that it supports DSC but I do not have one, so I only know what I read. Apple seems to use 2 different modes via TB that are conflicting and only Apple can control (a tiled mode that consumes 2 DP connections and no DSC and a mode with a single connection+DSC). But I have no idea which one of those is the default mode that you get on non-Apple TB hosts and the existence of this non-standard option may be a problem for hosts. Without TB that point is moot, as there is only one DP link, it requires DSC for full resolution.The problem is that, on a TB host port, you cannot usually prevent the use of a TB link and force fallback to DP Alt mode, should the connection through TB not work.On the Surface Pro 9, even if the second TB port was in use and also already consuming 1 DP connection and the Pro XDR was using tiled mode, I would at least expect one of the halves (3008 pixels wide) to be recognized. If Windows is not recognizing any monitor at all on the Surface Pro 9, I would rate your chances of success to be near zero.

      "content of comments: (0 children)There are dozens of videos on youtube addressing this exact question with specific tests. The issue with asking on this kind of sub is that it'll be pretty hard to get actually objective advice. Most people here for example will have experience with only their XPS and/or limited experience with a Macbook, and it's natural for people to recommend what they themselves bought.Check the many youtube videos from large and small youtubers alike, that will be a better way to get accurate data.I can still share my own experience but I'd still recommend checking the videos. So in my own limited experience with 2 weeks of XPS and 1 year+ of Macbook (you can guess which what was my choice from that I'm sure), here are the pros and cons of each machines.XPS pros:XPS cons:Macbook pros:Macbook cons:That's from my own experience which led me to go with the Macbook (very happy about it, to the point I even got a 14 inch as a more mobile setup as well), but once again check the many videos on that specific comparison to get some hard numbers and more unbiased opinions.[–]AusGeno 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago(1 child)I have both, I prefer my MacBook for doing things with my photos but I much prefer Windows for dealing with files and transfers and organising my photos in general.[–]roththereporter[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)Interesting, thanks! I take it you also notice it takes longer to transfer files from your SD card on the MacBook for some reason? Or do you have other reasons you prefer each?Is the battery life on the XPS an issue for you compared to on the MacBook?[–]SocialisticAnxiety 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago*(2 children)The GPU in the M1 is pretty powerful, so performance might be similar. https://www.notebookcheck.net/Comparison-of-Laptop-Graphics-Cards.130.0.htmlAs the MacBook isn't upgradable, I'd consider speccing it with more RAM and storage.The XPS has two slots for both SSD and RAM, so you can configure it however you want now, and upgrade later when you need it, which will be cheaper.If you can wait, there's also the upcoming 2023 XPS 15 and MBP 16\". If you can live with macOS, I'd recommend the Mac.If you can't, I'd recommend the XPS.You can also consider how important OLED and touch is to you. The Mac has way better battery life, it's not even close.Edit: Oh, and get the XPS if you're planning on doing any gaming.[–]WarSport223 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(1 child)Any idea what changes are in store for the 2023 XPS?[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)I'm guessing a chassis redesign a la XPS 13 (Plus) with all that follows, 13th gen Intel, and RTX 40X0 series.It's been two years since a redesign, so it's about time, and would make sense that it follows after the 13\" had one.RTX 40X0 especially should be a pretty big upgrade, and of course the new design.[–]WarSport223 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(3 children)This is exactly what I was going to say;\n",

Buy if you've lived in a Windows world, I'd recommend staying there. Macs are not upgradable, so you will have to decide now what will be your needs  in, say, 5 years' time. You'll suffer for it if you get a Mac and decide for low space/ram specs. They are also not repairable at all. Any issue you have with them, you have to go to apple and their price will be almost as much as a new machine, that and they take weeks to repair. Dell machines are very upgradable. They have more upgrades, and you can upgrade ram and ssd down the line. They are also very repairable, if you need for work, opt for prosupport plus to get the most out of dell service. They offer next day repair, usually always, so downtime is minimal.\n",
      "For premiere pro, I use a dell precision 7540. You can now get a newer version like the 7560. Those things scream performance.

Good luck[–]Maze_of_Ith7 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago(2 children)Tough one, maybe follow and/or read Wirecutter’s recommendations.

The MacBook Pro is just so good at video editing and I am on the path to do a full windows re-install for the XPS since there is so much bloatware/garbage on it and it doesn’t seem to perform as well as I hoped given the hardware. The thing runs like a chainsaw (exaggerating but the thermals/noise is real). To be fair I knew most of this going in (minus the bloatware), I just underestimated how annoyed I’d be dealing with it. I could also underestimate the learning curve of moving to a Mac, something I’ve been afraid of for the last 5+ years. Again though, I really liked Wirecutters review but is more aimed at video editing.[–]Midnight_wolf00 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)I’ve owned both and while I loved my XPS up to the day it died, I’m gonna have to go with the  MacBook on this one. The M1 chips are insanely powerful and part of the reason why I switched to a Mac. The battery life on my MacBook Pro has completely blown my XPS out of the water as I can get about 3 5+ hour days on a single charge and I’d need to charge my XPS daily if not more often. If you’re worried about about the lower RAM on the Mac, MacOS does an amazing job of optimizing the RAM. If you ever were to need technical support, Apples customer service is also quite a bit better to deal with than Dell’s as well. The only downside to the Mac imo is the lack of the ability to upgrade the machine.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(1 child)it's gotten to a point where the battery only lasts about an hour and it's struggling to keep up with Lightroom, Premiere, etc.I'm going to provide an alternative view/strategy.Why not replace the battery with a new one and extend the machine's lifespan? This will give you the option of waiting for this year's machines to come out.It's expected that the new Macs will be announced in March (because no new machines were announced in Q4 2022) and the new XPS models will probably become available sometime in Q2.From what I gather, you're in the US so you can easily get a genuine OEM Dell battery which should restore your battery life. The 84Whr version:https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-6-cell-84-wh-lithium-ion-replacement-battery-for-select-laptops/apd/1p6kd/pc-accessoriesand the 56Whr version:https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-3-cell-56-wh-lithium-ion-replacement-battery-for-select-laptops/apd/m7r96/pc-accessoriesYou'll need to check your boot drive and current battery capacity because if you have a SATA boot drive, you probably have a 56Whr battery due to the way the SATA drive occupies the space where the larger battery would be:https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-15-9550-laptop/xps-15-9550-laptop-sm/procedure?guid=guid-43536922-33c8-4e6f-aa8a-6da9fa993555&lang=en-usWhen you later decide to get a new machine, you can sell your XPS with the new-ish genuine battery which a buyer will probably appreciate (and increase the XPS's value a little).As for the \"struggling to keep up with Lightroom, Premiere, etc.\", yeah that's probably from the 6th Gen Intel CPU it has, and which probably warrants a newer machine.I won't provide advice re. XPS or Mac. There are already enough opinions in this post. All I will say is: if you can, wait for the new models.HTH.[–]roththereporter[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)Thanks! The battery has actually been replaced within the past two years because the original one was bulging and causing issues with the trackpad.I did think about trying to sell this one, but it seems like nobody is really biting on other's listings on Facebook Marketplace or eBay so I don't know if I'd have much luck, sadly. I might end up giving it to a relative or using it to tinker with Windows.Also definitely considering waiting for the newer models. It's very tempting. I am on a college/grad school budget though so I'm not sure if it's worth an extra $400-$700 (between the lack of sale pricing and possibly going for a higher model if I'm not bound by specific sales).[–]mikedropstech 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)Some great feedback on here for sure. I reviewed the 15 a while back (https://youtu.be/tsTPL2U1zuM) and also did a comparison review in a second video of just the 3.5k OLED vs 4K vs MacBook Pro just to show off the difference in screen quality.

I also do CS and it’s more than capable of the stuff we’re doing. It’s maybe a bit heavier than I’d like but overall fine. Battery life out of the box wasn’t great (pre installed windows install was flaming hot garbage) after a fresh install and some optimising it’s alright but nothing outstanding. I have the 4k panel (I mainly wanted the touchscreen) and run it at 1200 p most of the time and I get around 6-8 hours depending on the workload so always carry a charger with you just in case - also windows modern standby is horrific and has woken my machine in my bag more than once and drained the battery. I haven’t had any QC or reliability issues on my machine so far, other than the windows install, but many people have had issues with the XPS lineup across the board. Since you said you’re waiting til 13th gen in the XPS’s, keep your eyes peeled with all manufacturers as CES just wrapped up and there were lots of manufacturers showing of new stuff with intel 13th gen and 4000 series gpu’s.

As high voltage can damage or weaken IC's that aren't visibly messed up.I'd likely scrap/but might get another motherboard if it were cheap unless you can get dell to replace it.

It’s their fault for not putting ANY thermal protection on the one spot that literally transfers voltage across the motherboard. Oh and pair that with a passive fan design that doesn’t actually force any airflow? I saw someone fix their design. All they had to do was put thermal pads on all of the vrms, create a copper sheet that would touch them all, cover it all in tape so pc doesn’t short. Create a under and over channel for this copper sheet so that the bottom fan can push and the top can pull. Then your computer won’t freeze, stutter whenever you really use it for something serious and it probably won’t melt down. Well that is so long as your copper sheet, thermal pads don’t end up falling off. Oooh also make sure not to use a thermal pads that is too effective at conducting heat, as it can actually cause more heat to get stuck in the vrm because the copper sheet is thin.Dell for the win great work dell! So glad you decided to save 4$ a computer rather than construct it with proper cooling.Edit: oh ya and a two core radiator design that’s somehow supposed to cool a processor and the gpu at the same time with two fans I couldn’t ever imagine actually using for a computer.How did this design even get approved??Edit 2: oh and the fins that are attached to the end of the radiator cores… what’s even the point they’re so small they basically do nothing except suck up dust.. maybe look at how much crap has gotten stuck in their.

      "content of comments: (0 children)The 3050 Ti does work with external outputs of course, that would be a nonsensical pay off for any kind of laptops (not to mention a high end model like the XPS lines). Believe me the difference between the internal and external GPU is such that you would immediately recognize it. Screen tearing can still appear with vsync on and one of the reason is when framerate drops below the refresh rate. The 3050 Ti is not exactly a powerhouse, so maybe the reason you see more tear on the external monitor is because you're not able to push a constant 75fps (external monitor refresh) but only close to 60fps (laptop monitor refresh).[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(0 children)I think a few things need clarification. In the XPS 15, the Intel GPU (iGPU) is the processor which generates the video signal that is sent to the internal LCD and the external displays/monitors.Most software on the XPS will use the iGPU. This is done to preserve/extend the battery life because the dGPU uses significantly more power than the iGPU. Some software must use the discrete GPU (dPU) which is the NVIDIA 3050 Ti in the XPS 15. Software such as games and graphics software like Photoshop or CAD software require the dGPU. The machine will switch to using the dGPU when such software is used. You can actually change the setting in the Windows Settings app.When the NVIDIA GPU is in use, it is only used to render geometry and execute the shaders into a framebuffer. The framebuffer is then converted to a video signal by the iGPU.​the 3050 ti doesn't actually work when external monitors are hooked up?this is incorrect. If you understand that the iGPU is producing the video signal, you can see that this isn't correct.​experience screen tearing.​when I play Destiny 2 ONLY on the laptop (not hooked up to the dock), screen tearing is much less frequent or nonexistent.this would indicate that the dock is doing something with the video signal or is delaying it enough that the screen updates are not as well synchronized which in turn produces the tearing. Since you are using a 75Hz refresh rate, the timing is even more sensitive because each frame is displayed for even less time than, say, if a 60 Hz refresh rate were being used.HTH.\n",

Obviously, the 9320 (being a newer design) has a presence sensor and thus supports the wake on approach function.HTH.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(1 child)Interesting!I was going off of this:\n",

I also see that Modern Standby is supported which is also one of the requirement.[–]note20ultra[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(2 children)Still it is something unknown reason as mentioned by u/SocialisticAnxiety . Dell introduced Presence Detection based express signin in 2019 end in their Latitude series. Also Presence sensor work with the help of camera and also another requirement is Modern Standy sleep setting which can also be enabled in 9520. So yes its reason unknown.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(1 child)It appears I got it wrong, and it is only using the camera and other face recognition sensors for Windows Hello facial recognition, while presence detection requires a presence sensor, as mentioned by u/parasymchillsSo I guess the reason is that the 9520 does not have a presence sensor.[–]parasymchills 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(0 children)I believe this is correct.If the 9520 had the presence sensor, it should be offering the wake on approach functions in the power settings, which are named \"Automatically turn off my screen when I leave\" and \"Automatically wake up my device when I approach\", and the sensor should be listed in the Device Manager.Since none of these things are present on the 9520, it follows that it doesn't have a presence sensor and it doesn't support wake on approach.I hope this clears up the mystery.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)Since it's using the camera, I don't see what the constraint would be. The 9520 is using a years old design, while the 9320 is a brand new design, so there might be something the 9320 has that the 9520 don't.On my 9520, the sensors used for Windows Hello blink a bright red light, which I find annoying and haven't seen on other laptops. If the 9320 doesn't do this, that might be a reason.I see that part of this feature is also locking the laptop when you walk away. A similar feature exist in native Windows, by pairing a Bluetooth device (phone, headphones, etc.) with the laptop. It will then lock when the distance to the Bluetooth device increases.\n",

They’re fairly competent units with decent efficiency unlike some of the crappy, off-brand, unpainted steel PSU’s you find. The main issue with them is they are severely power limited, like you mentioned, only barely allowing for the hardware dell supplied the machine with.

It doesn’t make any sense to me to have fans blowing underneath your laptop if they themselves are choking for air because they are a millimeter above the desk.  :-/Another thing it has which seems lacking in others is an infinitely adjustable dial so you can turn the fans as low or high as you want.

      "content: i received my xps 15 9520 in late july. since just about day one of running it, almost every time i booted it up i would get the support assist screen saying it was testing the processing fans. a month later, i began my semester in a pretty demanding program, and simply didn't have the time to deep dive into the issue. i also ended up using the computers on campus, as they were optimized for my study activities. when i did use the laptop over the fall semester, it performed ok at best; the keyboard would often get really hot, the fan would randomly start spinning quite loudly, and it sometimes would be quite stubborn when i was trying to boot it up (wouldn't turn on on the first try, etc...). so, when the semester ended, i got in touch with dell. first they had me run diagnostics over the phone, and when those failed to resolve the issue, they sent a tech to replace the fans. the new fans made a difference... for a day. and then out of nowhere i started getting blue screen errors, with different error messages each time. again, i called premium support, and again, they had me run diagnostics as well as remote accessed the laptop to run more tests. these phone calls ended up being around 2 hours each time. the issues persisted, so we got to the point where the tech wanted me to backup my files so we could do a reinstall of windows. upon reinstalling windows, the laptop would not recognize any wifi networks, and after some poking around the tech realized it was because the wifi drivers needed to be reinstalled. he said he would email them to me so i could load them onto a flash drive and then transfer them to the laptop. this would about 3 hours into the phone call. at that point, i thanked him for his help but explained that these calls were taking up way too much time (i'd sunk about 12 hours into dealing with tech support up until then), and asked to speak to a manager about a replacement or refund because i don't have endless hours to be on the phone with tech support, especially as nothing they had done had resolved the issue. i spoke with several supervisors, and just got off the phone today with a customer service rep from their \"corporate\" team, and they all said the same thing: a) technical issues happen with computers, b) you should have called sooner, its past 30 days so a refund or replacement is impossible, and c) they can send a tech to come fix it. all in all, a pretty crappy experience, both in terms of customer service and in the performance of the laptop. if anyones considering a dell product, i would advise looking elsewhere.\n",

As others have said, clean the fans and pick out any dust/fluff in the fans & where fans meet the air vents, with some tweezers.For the battery, get a plastic spudger kit from ifixit / amazon to seperate the battery connector, then undo the screws for the battery and it will come out.For turning on as it boots, I'd suggest letting it boot and then do a shutdown. To see if it fully shuts down- the laptop may not have properly shut down & be in sleep mode from when it was shut before.[–]Melonful[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(0 children)ok thanks a bunch[–]Melonful[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(2 children)Ok so I spilled some water on the keyboard part, dried it, shut it down, and took it apart, does it look like there's anything unordinnary or any problems?

You got lucky here.Water did damage the keyboard tho, the traces/connections corrode easily. If you are confident enough opening the laptop, you should be able to change the keyboard, make sure you get one with the correct backlight pinout. I have changed my laptops keyboard myself, its no biggie, just keep taking pics so you dont forget what connectors go where.And then clean the fans while putting it all back together.[–]Melonful[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(2 children)ok thanks I dried it for another day or so and some of the keys start to work now however some still are bunched up with the ones next to them thanks anyway I might tr y that[–]Saadski 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(1 child)The keyboard will gradually fail, might as well change it or get it changed asap.Good luck.[–]reiimaru 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)Exactly. The keyboard isolates itself from the rest of the internals, so unless water found its way through the vents the most probable worst case scenario is a partially dead or completely dead keyboard.Keep in mind that humidity below the keycaps can prevent some keys to function for days. On Screen Keyboard can be handy.PS: a dead kb could constantly produce inputs that may prevent boot or normal functions of the laptop, so if you want to keep using it with On Screen Keyboard app or an external kb while you're waiting for a replacement all you need to do is detach the internal kb connector.\n",

I'm a fairly regular-sized human being, 179cm, slightly larger-than-average hands, and I still can't believe how I managed to use an XPS 13 9360 for 5 years as my primary and mainly undocked computer. As soon as I switched to a 9520 it felt like I was using a miniature laptop. For the sub 15,6\" laptop class, 14\" with a 16:10 or 3:2 display ratio are simply the best all-round proportions for a good compromise in portability and productivity (basically a ThinkPad). For the XPS 15 a switch to 16 would be less pronounced since 13\" is 13.3\", and 15\" is 15.6\".

Already change drivers, cables (high quality and fully compatible for 4K60Hz) and try using different ports : Thunderbolt 3, HDMI 2.0 etc the issue is the exact same. Now I just plug the screen after the pc booted alone to avoid this issue (don't happen all the time but often). I even try on my GF 9500 and exact same issue.Having to buy an expansive hub or consistently unplug/plug cables as a workaround is unacceptable for such a simple thing given price tag and hardware.[–]reiimaru 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(1 child)Do you get the same behaviour with the mini-hub (HDMI+USB-A) included with the laptop?[–]Pasties_r_Good[S] 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago(0 children)That’s interesting - the behavior with the Dell adapter is good - albeit just one monitor and one mouse.

They are the same in 1.13.1: 0x43 for CFG Lock and 0x10E for Overclocking Lock. The store is also the same: 0x3 or CpuSetup.Previously, I had a problem with Intel DTT service/drivers blocking some memory areas from modification.It would be great if someone else with XPS 17 with 12900HK and the undervolting enabled would check if it's still working.[–]rbthompsonv 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago(3 children)I'll do so later today ;) (I also, happen to have the 12900HK in my 9720)[–]toniyevych[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago(2 children)Thank you!

The first one (1.13.1) was marked with the following note:- Once the BIOS is upgraded to version 1.13.1, you cannot downgrade the BIOS to earlier versions.but it actually works.Anyway, the downgrade is not an option, it is something Dell should fix. The only way to achieve that is to support a thread on the official Dell forum.[–]nicknickmeetnick 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(5 children)Why you guys are undervolting it? Does default thermal sucks? Which processor do you have: i7 or i9? Please post your thermals here[–]toniyevych[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(4 children)There're a few reasons for undervolting:- Lower the fan noise under light loads- Increase the battery life for a few hours- Get 10-15% more performance under full loadAs for the CPU, you can undervolt only Core i9 12900HK in addition to HX lineup in other devices. Regular Core i7 12700H don't support it.[–]nicknickmeetnick 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(3 children)Thank you for your answer. I heard some Dell xps bios update block cpu undervolting. Is that true? Can you undervolt yours with latest bios? I'm asking because I'm thinking on buying one[–]toniyevych[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(2 children)Initially undervolting was unlocked for all the devices with an appropriate CPU, but somewhere in 2019 vendors started to disable this feature in the BIOS. It was still there, but disabled and often hidden.The formal reason was protecting the device from the plundervolt vulnerability.All the modern Dell laptops have this feature disabled, but it can be enabled with some tricks. Some other vendors also do something similar (hide this feature completely or under an \"advanced\" BIOS mode).The problem is that in recent BIOS updates for XPS 15 and 17 those settings are ignored and undervolting is not applied.Maybe, it can be solved by specifying voltage offsets directly in the hidden BIOS settings, but it is a huge workaround, not a solution.[–]nicknickmeetnick 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(1 child)Nice! Thanks for sharing these resources on undervolting with new bios.I'm willing to get the i9 over i7... does it really worth the difference? I'm afraid i9 throttling may get i9 even slower than i7... do you experience throttling even undervolting i9? How often do you experience throttling? If it throttles and gets slower than i7 it really doesn't worth IMO.Unfortunately there's no much vídeos or detailed reviews on these \"specific\" issues on XPS\n",

      "content: hi, recently, i updated the bios on my dell 9720 with core i9 12900hk from 1.11.0 to 1.12.0 and found that the voltage offsets specified through throttlestop were not applied. intel xtu also wasn't able to adjust voltages. it showed the undervolt protection error. this situation usually occurs when certain memory areas (0x150 msr) are locked and marked as read-only. i've double-checked the virtualization settings (memory integrity, hyper-v, etc.) and even tried to disable the virtualization support in bios, but the voltage offsets still were not applied. later i tried to update bios to 1.13.1 and reset bios settings, but the issue was still in place. additionally, i've checked the overclocking lock and cfg lock settings in bios and double-checked if their offsets are the same. ultimately, i solved this issue by downgrading bios to 1.11.0. now i want to clarify if it is related to the bios firmware by itself or if there are issues between my windows setup and the new bios. has anyone experienced the same problem after bios upgrade to 1.12.0 or 1.13.1? thank you!\n",

For me its just bloatware.[–]Virtamancer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(1 child)I did the same thing with my last XPS. But this time I didn't because when I went to sell the last one, a lot (most) of potential buyers want the Dell warranty and the peace of mind that comes with having Dell software to babysit you (stuff like the recovery features, and the Dell support software which is tied into the outside-of-windows software).I don't mind losing all of it, in fact I prefer to wipe it as long as windows finds the true Dell drivers for every component. My question is about whether I can get it back—for when I go to sell it, or even if I decide some feature is useful.[–]snerpkillsderbledorf 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(0 children)I have wiped my drive and reinstalled Windows about 6 or 7 times the past few days so I feel like I can chime in lol.I have a new XPS 15 and I took a complete image of the disk with Macrium Reflect before I started, and I just restored it and the laptop works just like it did before. All of this to try to fix what I think is a defective touchscreen 😒 But anyway, if you use a tool that gets all the partitions, including the hidden/recovery ones, I don't see why it wouldn't restore everything back. A lot of the diagnostics and recovery stuff is in the EFI/BIOS, not even on the hard drive.If you want to sell in the future, you could use the Dell OS Recovery Tool to make a bootable USB, and that will wipe the drive and re-create the Dell-specific recovery partitions, downloads drivers, etc etc. How 'accurate' it is to the factory image, I'm not sure, but from what I saw everything worked again after wiping the drive. Even the somewhat creepy remote-control diagnostics that you can trigger from Dell's website worked perfectly after I wiped the drive lol. Well, everything except the touchscreen, but I'm pretty sure it's a hardware failure that I need Dell to fix.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(4 children)You can always install Dell SupportAssist recovery after the fact, and it will also be installed when doing a Windows install using SupportAssist.But you can't get the original image back without doing a backup, as the one from SupportAssist is just a clean Windows install with Dell Update, which afterwards prompts you to get the drivers and apps you can find on the Dell website.[–]Virtamancer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(3 children)Does supportassist recovery do a reimage of the drive, and put all those tools on it like it's new out of the box?I don't need the \"original image\", if there's some Dell tool that will reimage it for me and make it like new.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(2 children)No. Like I said, SupportAssist just does a clean Windows install with Dell Update, which afterwards prompts you to get the drivers and apps you can find on the Dell website.It's the same as if you did a clean Windows install yourself, and afterwards manually installed the drivers available in the Dell website. There are apps, drivers and services you can't get again when doing that, like some Dell power management and the My Dell app.The only way to get an image like what it ships with, is to back it up from a new machine.[–]Virtamancer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(1 child)Wow damn. Even a Mac's recovery software reimages the drive; I thought that would be standard with big brand name windows manufacturers ESPECIALLY Dell.Sad because now I can't even get an out-of-the-box image without using the recovery software myself thus wiping my drive lmao.Well thanks for the clarification that's really what I needed to know.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(0 children)Yeah, it's weird. They went away with providing system images per device with Windows 11, where it was replaced with the SupportAssist Recovery method.I think they still provide images for Windows 10, but of course only for devices that didn't ship with Windows 11.I realised my mistake when I reimaged my laptop thinking it would be the factory image. Instead, I should've just used the Windows reset feature, which resets from the image on the laptop.\n",

It is a built in solution. Again, just because it's not the solution you want, doesn't make it not an actual solution.Now, it dosent matter in this situation.BUT, sleep, is in and of itself, an option. Not only is sleep an OPTION, there are varying levels of that option, different states, different levels of sleep designed by different manufacturers. And Microsoft (well, it is, but for the sake of this argument) isn't a hardware designer (again. The surface is built by Microsoft, and it's sleep function works perfectly fine. Just like apples sleep works perfectly fine on apple products, and is hit or miss when put on PC hardware (read: hackintosh).SO... Powering off your laptop prior to shoving it into a backpack is not only the best practice, it is also something you should do to protect your laptop. Not only from things like overheating, but also in instances of theft. If your laptop is in sleep mode and doesn't require a password tou lock after sleep, if it gets stolen, the perpetrator has direct and immediate access to your information...But sure, let's cry about how the built in protection is a workaround instead of a solution...I think you should probably look up the definition to workaround.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 2 points3 points4 points 11 days ago(10 children)Workaround - a method of overcoming a problem.Yes, you're overcoming the problem, but by doing something else entirely. You're not solving the issue. Hibernation doesn't allow for fast startup and Connected Standby, which is when the laptop is connected to the internet and able to do tasks while sleeping, like playing music or uploading/downloading files. In fact, not even normal S3 sleep allows that, only S0 sleep aka Modern Standby.You're overcoming the problem. You're not solving it. Hibernation is not a solution. It doesn't allow you to do the same things. Which is the problem.90% of your comment is just plain wrong. Modern Standby is broken on many laptops, especially high-performance ones. Of course Microsoft has been able to fix the issue on their own laptops, as the issue lies in the vast amount of different hardware configurations not playing well with Modern Standby. Furthermore, S3 sleep has it's own issues and can be as unstable as S0 sleep is now. Microsoft is pushing S0 sleep as hard as they are as a workaround (read: not a solution) to S3 sleep. These are all Microsofts words in an interview with LTT.According to LTT, they have been experiencing the same issues in macOS, even on Apple Silicon, as well as in Windows on Intel Macs. By default Windows devices do require passwords after sleep (when they actually sleep correctly) on laptops by most OEMs, but if not, it can be enabled in the Windows settings.Sleep, and S0 sleep in particular is being marketed as a feature. If it's not working correctly, and isn't being fixed, that's false marketing. And if marketed, you should expect to be able to use that feature like marketed, e.g. by closing the lid on your laptop and throwing it in your bag. Stop defending companies, they're not your friends. They're businesses that exist to make money off of you.[–]rbthompsonv -3 points-2 points-1 points 11 days ago(9 children)A method of overcoming a problem:TURN THE FUCKING THING OFF LIKE A GOD DAMNED FUCKING ADULT![–]not2rad[S] 1 point2 points3 points 11 days ago(0 children)I agree that hibernating is probably the closest thing to sleep that works properly (and it's what I currently use)... but it's much slower and hard on the SSD when done frequently (esp if the machine has lots loaded into memory.[+]rbthompsonv comment score below threshold-8 points-7 points-6 points 11 days ago(3 children)Turn off your laptop.Place your laptop in your backpackProblem solved.[–]not2rad[S] 4 points5 points6 points 11 days ago(2 children)I expected this.Unfortunately, this is a workaround, not a solution.[–]rbthompsonv -2 points-1 points0 points 11 days ago(1 child)Having been the solution for laptop users for 20 years, it is in fact, not a workaround...

All we're expecting is that all 3 of these options to do what they're designed to do.[–]RustedD0g 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)It’s faster for me to shut down and cold start than it is to hibernate and bring it back.  It’s only about 20-30 seconds longer to boot compared to bring it back from sleep.  I have my laptop do backups, play music, and serve data from SQL sever.  I need it to stay on when the lid is closed.  For me, the lid close and sleep is the biggest (of many) annoyances of  MacBooks.[–]rbthompsonv 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(1 child)There is no such thing as S0 sleep. S0 state is ON. State S0 is when your PC is fully on and all hardware is powered.See. You say I'm 'gatekeeping' and I'm not. You're just intentionally ignorant.Again, I posted all of the S states as defined by Microsoft . Please reference it again. Or, if you don't trust me, spend 30 seconds on Google[–]not2rad[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)You know, I did look at the article you shared again... and again, I agree that S0 is fundamentally not an ACPI Sleep State... so Microsoft's language is definitely confusing.  However,  at the bottom it recommended the following page that shows S0 has a Working state and a Sleep state (also called \"low-power idle\") which is also the same thing as Modern Standby:  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/power/system-power-states?source=recommendationsFurthermore, this article explains what happens during modern standby (within S0) to achieve low power by shutting down the SoC and entering what they call \"DRIPS\" and \"DDRIPS\":https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/functional-overview-summaryAnyway, my point here is that implying that there aren't sub-states for S0 and therefore the laptop is completely awake and active when in Modern Standby is far from the truth.​I'm all for keeping the discussion technical... the gatekeeping I am talking about is the attitude that brought you to this thread of \"adults shut down their PC and people who want Modern Standby to work properly are whiny babies\" is nonsense.  Data loss isn't a concern either... it's a convenience feature that makes resuming your work MUCH faster than shutting down or even hibernation.Also, for the third time, the expectation of how this should work came from Microsoft... NOT just a bunch of people making assumptions.  Furthermore, Microsoft themselves have said that this IS A PROBLEM.... so what are we even debating?  It should work properly on hardware that supports it (including the 9270's that we're both using) and sometimes it doesn't...which is frustrating for lots of users and deserves to be fixed.If they can manage to fix this, I feel like everyone wins, right?\n",

      "content of comments: (1 child)In an XPS with a NVIDIA RTX GPU in it, most of the display will actually be rendered by the Intel iGPU (which is also responsible for the video signal that goes to the LCD and any external displays). The NVIDIA dGPU is only used when an application is configured to use it.While most of the time the dGPU is not in use, it is powered so when you use the XPS on battery, it is consuming a very small amount of power (you cannot turn it off completely). For most people, this is not a concern and does not significantly impact battery life.There are several posts in this sub. about how to configure the machine to maximize its battery life. Some of the tips include things you can do to minimize the impact of the dGPU.As has been noted by u/SocialisticAnxiety, the version of the XPS with a dGPU has a larger battery than the Iris-only version, in part to give better battery life to compensate for the larger power use from having the dGPU in the machine, and it also compensates for the higher DPI screen (which use more power) that you typically have with the dGPU versions.HTH.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago(0 children)Good answer :)[–]SocialisticAnxiety 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(1 child)In theory only when you don't use the 3050.Be aware that some lower-specced models come with a 56Wh rather than 86Wh battery.[–]financier21[S] 2 points3 points4 points 12 days ago(0 children)Ok, thank you!\n",

That orange circle has two tiny metal pieces and when you click it in, they make contact to power up the machine. Sometimes either the yellow tape falls of and the bounce metal piece falls of, or sometimes it breaks where it doesn't bounce anymore.

      "content of comments: (2 children)With pure Displayport connections, basically only bandwidth matters nothing else.And the WD19TB supports basically the full bandwidth the 12th gen iGPU can provide. Thanks to DSC (Compression) the WD19TB can even considerably surpass that bandwidth when connecting to multiple monitors. VRR/Adaptive Sync is however prevented by WD19TB and similar docks (on most of the outputs).[–]Bby144[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago(1 child)Thanks for the input. Would you be able to use adaptive sync with a TB to DisplayPort connection from the TB outlet on the WD19TB?[–]rayddit519 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago*(0 children)Yes. Pure TB still allows it. So the TB-out itself on those docks works. But if other ports are also used for monitor outputs it will be severely bandwidth limited.WD22TB4 has 2 TB-outs that lets you avoid this by exclusively using TB-outs. Or any of the other docks that do not employ MST / have the 3 TB-outs straight from the integrated TB-controller.[–]PERMANENTLY__BANNED 0 points1 point2 points 13 days ago(0 children)Save yourself some struggle and plug a TB cable directly into the laptop and the monitors and just use the dock for charging, LAN, and ports.

No further problems since.If you're curious, create a battery health report so keep a record of the battery's failure.

My technician was very competent and I gave a 5/5 feedback score for the work done.HTH.[–]BurtonGoutster[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(1 child)So, the new battery didn't work initially. It was reading 0% and had a communication error in the BIOS. The tech thought it was going to need a mainboard replacement, but upon cleaning the battery connector, it seems to be working now.I was using a Satechi 100W PD charger (it's been fine for my phone and tablet) for my XPS and the tech believed that may have damaged the mainboard. I always thought power delivery and the laptop negotiated the appropriate 45W. Do you use the OEM charger?All in all, I don't know for sure if the original battery was bad, but at least I got a brand new battery and my laptop works now.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(0 children)Do you use the OEM charger?yes. I have a 9520 and I'd rather use the provided charger. I normally don't have anything else plugged in to the USB ports like a dock so I don't concern myself with other chargers or PD issues.Re. the Satechi damaging the mainboard, I guess it's possible but it does seem unlikely unless it's faulty.​I don't know for sure if the original battery was bad, but at least I got a brand new battery and my laptop works now.if you don't get mainboard issues and nothing else is reported as faulty, it probably was the battery.After I got my replacement, I started using a custom charging regime of 50% to 65% (it starts charging at 50% and stops at 65%). Others use a 50-80 or 50-85 regime. Anyway, this is believed to extend the life of the battery. I mostly my machine on mains power so I can afford to use such a charging scheme.HTH.\n",

Does your model offer support for Linux or are you saying you execute them in wine or something?[–]roaur 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago*(0 children)I have a 9710 and I don't do anything specific except update my software packages - sometimes there are firmware updates. It looks like Dell offers updates via the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) and I can search and find firmware updates on my distro natively. https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ca/000122025/how-to-update-firmware-under-linuxDell even has a quote on the LVFS website saying how they find it useful: https://fwupd.org/It's funny you mention the executables because I don't see Linux as a supported OS on their driver website for my model. I've never thought to look here as they're available automatically on linux.edit: My laptop also came with Windows 11 Pro so I installed (first Ubuntu then) Pop_Os alongside it. While I can't boot with GRUB (pop_os uses systemd-boot) the f12 boot menu is cleaner, imo, to switch back to Windows. Anyway, I'm trying to say my laptop was Windows stock like yours but I can download Dell firmware updates through my software package manager despite installing Linux afterwards.[–]megamorphg 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago(0 children)I downgraded to Windows 10.

      "content of comments: (3 children)Socks what's happened. Warranty likely expired. Max I've gotten on a dell is 5 years. Ha e you tried another power adapter? Can you be certain the adapter is functional? What was a way you could tell the adapter was working without turning the laptop on? If you did nothing else to the laptop and it had been working without a battery, I see no other reason other than power adapter failing. Let us know what you find[–]manofblack_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago(2 children)What was a way you could tell the adapter was working without turning the laptop on?I deduced it from the fact that the LED on the charger head itself still illuminated when I plugged it into an outlet. I know that probably means nothing, but my logic was that if power wasn't getting through the AC adapter, then it shouldn't be able to illuminate the LED. Is this a wrong deduction? Would it be worth acquiring a new charger somehow to see of it would work? I could try asking a repairman to try it on another charger. I also extremely appreciate your response, Merry Christmas! 🙏🏿🙏🏿[–]jc1luv 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago(1 child)If the charger led is on then there should be no problem there. I assume the light on the laptop is not on while plugged? Ha e a lot at the connection on the laptop, could it be the port is damaged? It's rare to see this kind of laptops just lose power like this, unless some specific power overcharge caused it. But that would be obvious.[–]manofblack_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago*(0 children)I assume the light on the laptop is not on while plugged?Nope, not a single light on the laptop itself turns on at any point. The laptop is completely void of any visible means of function, it's practically a dud right now. No liquid or anything has entered the laptop, by outward appearance it seems absolutely fine. There was no odd behavior in the system or components itself leading up to this. It's rare to see this kind of laptops just lose power like this, unless some specific power overcharge caused it. But that would be obvious.That's exactly my thoughts, I've owned many laptops over the years and am quite tech proficient, none of them have ever just up and died like this. I would figure that any internal power related issues would be battery related, but since the battery is currently not connected, it leaves me quite dumbfounded as to what exactly happened here.[–]seancho 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago(2 children)Does the power cord make a solid connection with the motherboard connector?   If that little port is the fault, it's a cheap and easy replacement.[–]manofblack_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago(1 child)If that little port is the faultDo you reckon any way I'd be able to tell?The charging head itself fits into the port all the way in. Albeit its a bit loose, but I'm not sure if that's just how the XPS is because the charging head is quite small.[–]seancho 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago*(0 children)My XPS connectors are a bit loose.  Kind of normal.  You can test the power supply itself with a volt meter, and see if you can get a connection moving the cord end around.  Or even just buy the new motherboard power connector and try it.  Last one I bought was like $5 from china on ebay.   Other low-effort shots in the dark, you can reseat the ram and all the motherboard connectors.  Or even take everything off the motherboard and see if it beeps when/if you can start it.[–]Forremany 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago(0 children)Knowing the AC charger is working fine, I'd bet there is some residue electric charge on some component, like i/o ports.Try the following:\n",
      "1. Unplug the charger\n",
      "2. Unplug any sort of devices like USB cables, adapters, headphones, memory card\n",
      "3. Press and hold the power button for at least 20 seconds\n",
      "4. Plug the charger again and try to turn on the device\n",

      "content: as title suggests, dell xps 15 recently decided to just not boot at all. a few months ago the battery started to swell and push the trackpad up through its housing. i removed the swolen battery with the intent to get a new one this month in time for college. since then, i've been using the device without the battery with no issues. i keep it plugged in whilst using. last week, i plugged the laptop in to use it and it simply wouldn't boot. no lights of any description were illuminating and not a single fan was spinning. the device is completely void of any visible power. any ideas? this is completely and utterly random and comes at a really awful time. i was anticipating needing to buy a new battery, not an entirely new laptop for college. i haven't checked, but i can reasonably presume that due to its age and the fact that i opened it up, the warranty is completely void. has this happened to anyone else? i'm at a loss here. i would really appreciate it!\n",

      "content of comments: (7 children)It's Windows Modern Standby. Not a Dell or XPS specific issues, it impacts all laptops using it, which is most new ones.Here's a good video about it:https://youtu.be/OHKKcd3sx2c[–]sawer82 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago(6 children)Yet it works perfectly fine if you do a clean install without Dell crap-ware.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 2 points3 points4 points 17 days ago(5 children)In that case there might be other issues, but the issue of Modern Standby, you can't get around. It's pretty intermittent though, as mentioned in the video.[–]sawer82 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago(4 children)Modern (active) stand-by works just fine, it changes actively states until it hibernates if not used. Something in the default Dell image prevented the stand-by to change states, it even woke up with closed lid, so it stayed always in active standby, wasting battery. Clean install switches the states correctly, from active to standby to hibernate.[–]SocialisticAnxiety 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago(3 children)Those issues are prominent on any laptop using Modern Standby. I advise you to watch the video.Like I said, it's pretty intermittent though, and I've rarely had the issue myself.[–]woodenU69 8 points9 points10 points 18 days ago(4 children)Try hibernating instead….. it solves that problem…… good luck 👍🏻[–]Rezae_heat[S] 1 point2 points3 points 18 days ago(2 children)Thanks, any other issues I need to be aware of?[–]woodenU69 0 points1 point2 points 18 days ago(1 child)Think about getting a usb hub, a powered one, and pay attention to the usb version… I have some from J5create[–]Rezae_heat[S] 1 point2 points3 points 18 days ago(0 children)alr thanks[–]getoutdoors99 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago(0 children)This really does work well.[–]UserNumber71004 6 points7 points8 points 17 days ago(0 children)It's a Windows issue, not an XPS issue. I just set mine to hibernate when the lid is closed. Problem solved.[–]planedrop 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago(0 children)This is an issue with Windows itself and can't really be avoided on any laptop (in fact Macbooks have it too, just much less likely to occur). It's part of \"modern standby\" where the laptop is able to stay connected to the internet, etc..... while in sleep mode. ​However, it seems the best way to avoid it is NEVER put your laptop in sleep mode while it's still on the charger BEFORE putting it in your bag. I.E. it's fine to have it in sleep mode while charging, but if you are going to put it in a bag, make sure it's awake, unplug it, then put it in sleep mode and put it in your bag, this generally has worked great for me. ​If you have other questions about the 9520 let me know, I've got a top specced one as my main non-gaming laptop.[–]gabrielseth01 1 point2 points3 points 17 days ago(0 children)A lot of people are mentioning hibernate, but you can switch some conditions in task scheduler to stop running updates if not plugged in.[–]telenieko 2 points3 points4 points 17 days ago(1 child)On Linux, disabling RAID mode in BIOS helps a lot. Otherwise the cou cannot enter the lowest S0ix states.

This type of standby has its own raison d'etre to tell the truth. It is needed when the laptop has to do calculations for a long time, for example for a render, but not only (there are certainly other use cases). Therefore it is useful. You can use hibernate to shut down your laptop softly. After several Nvidia and Windows updates over the last few months, hibernate works more efficiently than before.[–]sawer82 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago(0 children)Stand-by never really worked on my Dell XPS 15 until I did a clean W11 install without Dell crap. Works like a charm now.[–]GMoney7304 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago(0 children)Hibernation keeps being toted as a no-brainer fix for modern standby, but I've always been told that frequently hibernating results in a quicker SSD death.[–]Joyrenee22 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago(0 children)I haven't had any noticeable issues the impact my use with my 9520- that said the stand by time is noticeable worse than my wifes m1 air, but this thing is way more powerful, and not intended to be as portable - so I don't mind at all. Hoping windows fixes this shit soon - but I still love mine and have pretty acceptable battery life.\n",

I received an email yesterday saying my order has been delayed and that it’s estimated to be delivered on November 29th!I know waiting is part of ordering a prebuilt pc, though how long would it actually take to get here? Is the date they sent accurate, or is it meant to be an easily met deadline? When i called Dell support yesterday, they didn’t mention anything about a part shortage, but said it should be shipped “in the next few days”. What’s everyone else’s experience, is this normal? Just don’t wanna get my hopes up prematurely lol[–]Gijoejoegut 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago(10 children)Just giving my experience so far to keep those in this place up to date.

Hope this helps someone.[–]Gijoejoegut 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(9 children)Update. Was slated to arrive a day early 28NOV2022 but that slipped by.

It was delayed a day after expected delivery to Dec 18th. I cancelled the preorder and ordered an R13 with a 3090 as it seemed like the 6900XT was the issue in the delay. I’m not totally past the expected delivery yet, but I am fully expecting another delay. I contacted support and they are saying the processor is the missing part.

I purchased the R14 with the 6800XT in black Friday as well… and it had a problem, they sent  technicians 2 times to replace parts and didnt work, now they upgraded my R14 with more memory and a 6900XT with clear side panel, but yet not delivered. I am expecting it by January 10… really sad to wait that much[–]vinylbond 1 point2 points3 points 22 days ago(3 children)I ordered an m15 R7 on December 10. Order accepted the same day. Went into production on December 11. \"Build complete\" on December 12. At that point I was so happy as I thought I would maybe get my laptop faster than expected. But the status has since not changed. It's now December 18, it still shows as \"build complete\", but has not yet shipped. Estimated shipping date is December 21 (unchanged), estimated delivery date is December 27 (original December 29). I really am not sure why Dell is sitting on a laptop that was built a week ago. Maybe there is something I don't know.I'm in midwest US, if it makes a difference.[–]maybsofinitely 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(2 children)Hello, sorry to bother, but I'm just wondering if your laptop arrived on their scheduled time, early, or late? Thanks![–]vinylbond 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(1 child)It arrived early, on December 21. Interesting thing is that the delivery was a complete surprise as Dell didn’t update the order with shipment info. System was still showing that the order is in “build complete” step; yet one morning the laptop just showed up :) Dell updated its order info after the delivery.[–]maybsofinitely 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(0 children)Okay thanks alot! I got the same model on Jan 3, and went in production same day with estimated delivery Jan 18th. Just wanted to make sure of a general timeline, although the no shipping notice scares me. Hopefully it doesn't suddenly arrive without notice when I'm not at home.[–]EffectiveEmu1904 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(3 children)Has anyone else had this much of an issue with deliver from Dell? Ordered on Oct 3rd 2022 original delivery date was around Oct 8th I think I don't remember exactly. Then the emails start rolling in week after week.Revised Delivery Date: OCT. 20, 2022Revised Delivery Date: OCT. 26, 2022Revised Delivery Date: NOV. 02, 2022Revised arrival: Dec 6, 2022I did a online chat sometime in mid October and I was told that some stock was missing they're getting it in ASAP. Then on October 31st I called and was told that everything was now in stock and the estimated arrival date \"Nov 5th\" should be met. I never got a email for this revised date cause I'm assuming it was jus a couple more days from the quoted date in the original email so that got my hopes up it was coming soon. Now its telling me I'll get it in December! 2 months from when I ordered it! This can't be acceptable for such a big company! Is this at all normal for anyone else who has bought a Alienware/Dell?[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)We actually have not been seeing much in terms of delays or longer then usual delivery times lately, things seemed to be getting back to some semblance of normal.   Since you have already called I am not sure what else you can do aside from keep hounding them about it.  At this point, especially with the delayed delivery time they should at least be offering you something, it's not uncommon for them to offer a small refund of like $100 or something for the delay, based on what I have seen around here from others.   Back during Covid this was pretty normal, our shipping sticky was seeing hundreds of posts a month, but as you can see now, this month your the only one so far, and last month didn't have much either, which leads me to believe shipping has gone back to mostly normal.[–]EffectiveEmu1904 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(1 child)I did get offered $100  \"Thank you for contacting Dell Customer Care and for the opportunity to resolve your issue. Hopefully this issue has been resolved to your satisfaction. As per our conversation please reply me back to this email once you receivethis order so that we can process $100 credit for you.\" By this point I think I'd rather pay a extra $100 to get my PC in a timely manner.[–]AW_SupportDell Customer Support 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Hi,Sorry to hear you're having issues and I see you are looking for assistance.

If your in the US probably around 3, but I was usually looking around 4 up in Canada due to the delivery times.  If it's still stuck in production in another week or two I would call them up and ask what's going on.[–]kingz201 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)I ordered in UK.

Received by Dell and in production on November 16. My original ship date was at November 26, with an estimated delivery from November 28 to December 5.At some point yesterday it changed status from in production to build complete. The ship date revised to November 26, two days faster, with a delivery of December 1.How accurate is that these days? Is it possible I'll get it earlier?[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)It's possible, it depends how long it takes to come overseas and where you are, but chances are it will be somewhere around there.[–]select20 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*(0 children)Original order was placed on October 2nd and scheduled for delivery on October 16th. After 5 delays, the last \"scheduled\" delivery went from November 16th to December 16th. At the recommendation from someone here, I called sales, canceled the order and placed a new one. The sales person said the reason for the delay was the case. So If I canceled the order and made a few adjustments, they would throw expedited production and delivery for free and there wouldn't be any delays.That 1st order was canceled on November 8th and the 2nd order was placed on the same day with a delivery date of Novermber 16-21st. I was to be refunded the money from my original order in 48 hours.I got a notification today that my 2nd order was delayed now to December 6th and not only has my money from original order not been refunded, there is another charge trying to process in my account for the amount of the original order.It has been my son's dream of getting an Alienware for years and I literally can't get them to send me one. Or get my money back from my original order. This was supposed to be a birthday present but that has come and gone.Any suggestions? I'm on hold again atm with customer service hoping to figure out what is going on.**Just got off the phone, they gave me a case id number for the original refund and told me if I didn't receive it in 48 hours to call again. The problem with my 2nd order is a part again. They didn't say which part but would push it again to have it expedited. Thankfully I never told my kid about this, he would be asking me 10 times a day if I had heard anything. He still doesn't know.  Customer service was very polite. I never want to vent at them because their a \"middle man\" so to say. Lets hope everything gets resolved soon.[–]HolidayCookie3574 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(2 children)I bought an r13 on nov 14 (received by dell), and its delivery date was nov 28. Today, nov 25, I just got a text message about part shortage, and the delivery date is now delayed to dec 14.Part shortage is dell’s problem. I paid the price, and agreed with the delivery date, then it is dell’s responsibility to build that spec and deliver it on time. In reality dell could pay 2x~1000x to get the part; shortage is not a real thing.[–]HolidayCookie3574 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago*(1 child)Got 1 email reply so far:Due to higher-than-expected global demand and longer than normal shipping times, there is an inventory shortage which has resulted in longer lead times. However, I have submitted an expedite request to our manufacturing team on priority looking at the urgency for the order and we will try our best to ship your order as soon as possible.The order is in pre production stage. The estimated ship date is December 8 2022 and the estimated delivery date is December 14 2022.Furthermore, as a token of apology for any kind of delay or confusion caused, I would be glad to offer you a credit worth $100 for the overall experience. Kindly reply to this email with your consent and I would initiate this credit, which will be credited in the original mode of payment within 8 business days.I replied yes, and got this:I am happy to know that you have accepted the credit for $100. Once the order is shipped out please reply to my email and I will process the credit which will take 8 business days and will be posted to the original mode of payment.I am going to post an update later to tell you all if this $100 credit is actually received. So far so good; the support ticket is handled promptly within 1hour.[–]HolidayCookie3574 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)This package is here on Dec 5, 2022.

I’m seeing similar builds on their website give delivery dates of 12/12!! Like pretty much the same build.[–]dilhwly 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(5 children)What was your configuration? I ordered last week with earliest shipment of 12/2 (though it still hasn't hit production yet so I am expecting it to get delayed).[–]RWingsNYer 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(4 children)Without listing everything I got the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 16GB GDDR6 and the AMD Ryzen(TM) 7 5800X with a liquid-cooled processor.Edit: mine has been in production for about a week or so. Just doesn’t make sense how they can guarantee faster shipments on orders placed today than mine from two weeks ago with similar specs.[–]dilhwly 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(3 children)It probably depends on the components.

      "content of comments: (1 child)So my AWCC (x17) stopped working day before last and would not open whatsoever. I attempted to update what I could but that only seemed to have created more issues. I uninstalled the program and attempted to redownload it from both the Dell drivers support page as well as through Microsoft store through the link in the MyAlienware app, each time uninstalling and restarting before attempting each method. nothing helped. when I install it sometimes it won't even open and then sometimes it will begin to load and ask if AWCC can make changes to my system and I accept yes and then from then on it only sits a the white alien loading screen and then crashes. ​So, I googled the issue and attempted a complete reinstall of the system. Reinstalled windows and carefully updated windows drivers, Bios, and worked my way down the list of all the Critical drivers to be updated through the dell support. However, I cannot even get the OS system assist to install as of now.​I have carried this out 4 times now as I felt maybe I did something wrong along the way (I am not computer savvy unfortunately)  yet I still run into the same issue of installing AWCC and the white loading screen.​so my other option on install #4 was to use an older version of AWCC to which the  issue continued.​The big reason I am adamant on having the control center is because I am using a X17 Laptop and want to be able to control the fans as I do not want my laptop to over heat. currently I have it on a cooling pad with fans underneath ( I have seen many recommend the device so I purchased from amazon)  and I have it angled for more airflow as well. I attempted installs of MSI Afterburner as I read you can control your fans with that, but the options were greyed out, as well as checked through the corsair ICUE but they didn't allow it either. ​Is there something I am missing on the install or other options available to fix this issue. I've read many people just carried out a revo uninstall and reinstall (which i did) and it worked for them but I haven't been so lucky. Thank you in advance for any information or recommendations!​Happy New Year!![–]AW_SupportDell Customer Support 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago(0 children)Hi,Sorry to hear you're having issues and I see you are looking for technical assistance.

I would re-enable the device and attempt to look for a new chipset or USB driver on the support page.  Possibly even removing and letting Windows re-install it ( if that works ) could fix it as well.  Keep in mind Windows may not have the driver, you may need to get it from the Dell support page.[–]AndreLinoge55Alienware 17R5 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago(1 child)Thanks for that Mog, I’m just hesitant to re-enable it because I know it is going to restart that incessant USB connect/disconnect sound loop.

Specs are an 11800h with a 3080. In daily use for stuff like games (light loads like counterstrike or web surfing) it will act oddly, jumping from 50C to 95C back down to 60C then back to 95-100C (it will often also display 0, then begin showing a reading again). This is even under relatively light loads at around 25-40%. The GPU in this case doesn't usually pass 65 (and tends to hang in the mid 50s). Even typing this the CPU temp is hanging at 80-95 with only chrome and AWCC open at 8-11% usage. Opening anything more intensive (a windows defender scan for example) immediately spikes the temps to 100 and usage to 100. The fans turn on to max but the air coming out is cool (it also has a cooling pad underneath to increase airflow). My warranty is expired (as of Mid December, 2022) so I am wondering what the best course of action would be.Any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.[–]AW_SupportDell Customer Support 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago(0 children)Hi,Sorry to hear you're having issues and I see you are looking for technical assistance.

The 3070ti seems to be getting way to hot...like well into thermal throttle territory, and the fans are just screaming.  Nothing I do seems to have any impact on this, even adjusting fan speeds, unless I crank all the case fans, which makes the system beyond unbearably loud.I think there may be an issue with the GPU, since others with the same system and GPU's are showing GPU temps 20c below what I am seeing.I also have another Dell RTX 3080, and that GPU is hitting temps a good 12c cooler 🤔in the same system.  I feel like something may be wrong with this GPU?  BIOS is completely up to date, Windows is up to date and the system has no dirt or dust to speak of.  The fans look brand new.

I'm having a ton of issues keeping my external display outputting sound from my laptops HDMI. It's a Sony X85J it has some PC friendly features(including G Sync) but I'm worried because it's a TV I need some serious setting configuration on both my laptop and TV. I got some intermittent sound from a xbox series x as well. The series X seems to be working no problem now but the laptop will frequently cut out and I have to use sony's weird \"audio system\" choice in audio output to fix it. When I switch to this setting my laptop screen turn's on(its disconnected per norm) and upon switching back to my tv speaker(all of this being done on my tv settings) I regain audio. The audio cut's out the most when opening a new program or changing what I'm doing. Sonys best advice without contacting their live support told me to take a look at my HDMI output in sound settings. The article I read wanted me to make sure I was using a supported audio frequency but seeing as I can get sound to come through the TV as much effort as that may be didn't make me think this was the solution. The HDMI output driver is listed as a separate device than my Sony TV (which generally shows up as a Generic PNP monitor) and there was a driver update needed for the hdmi digital out but I had the cutout happen since. Nvidia control panel didn't have any options to configure that I could tell. I have the enhanced mode set for the HDMI input on the TV. If I set it to standard mode the audio works out the box(another sony support suggestion) but I wouldn't want to keep it this way because I lose my 120Hz at 4kish PC display setting in Nvidia control panel and the same 120hz option in the windows display settings. I will do a factory reset on the TV to be sure but there's so much going on at this point I'll call Dell first and have them be part of the overall troubleshooting. Also the audio settings show that there's output to my TV and even with the TV volume all the way up and the same for my windows volume settings I don't hear anything my laptop is playing(when the audio cutout has happened).  My specs are 3080Ti, 1080p 360hz laptop display, i912000hk, 64gb DDR5. I have a 65inch Sony TV model X85J for my HDMI port and a Dell G3223Q for my mini display port. Both stay connected but the Dell is disconnected in windows settings as is my internal laptop display. I run the laptop open lid sitting on a not in use cooling pad. My room temperature is around 70 and the laptop is located less than 3 feet from my Sony TV. My HDMI cables are new and already been replaced once(to test cable fidelity).[–]AW_SupportDell Customer Support 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)Hi,Sorry to hear you're having issues and I see you are looking for technical assistance.

I also bought an additional year of Premium Support, so this should be covered for service if necessary.It's been functioning just fine without issues up until ~2 months ago when the screen would just go blank randomly. I thought it was a software issue at some point, since it was almost always happening when switching from Brave browser to Chrome browser. Then I wondered if it was a graphics driver issue. It would always be fully functional after a restart and wasn't a consistent problem I could pin down.But having updated everything, it just happened again, and I wasn't doing anything at the time. Tried closing the lid and coming back ten minutes later, but it was still completely blank. Again, a restart gives me a fully functional machine.I'm pretty sure it's not heat.

I've taken a look at it whenever it would cause the sound, and I've narrowed it down to possibly being my back panel fan. From how it looks, the fan seems to be spinning faster than I believe it should be. The only other thing that I can add to suggest that it could be the back fan is that whenever the fan does seem to slow down, the noise begins to lessen.

Any chance you can link us to a 3DMark benchmark for comparison?[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 [score hidden] 7 hours ago*(3 children)You'll find that it's not a very robust solution for HD resolution and high frame rates because of the limitations on the bus transfer between the machine and the external unit. More frames/second means more loss due to overhead.BUT the good news is that for 4K and other scenarios that push the card to its limits, there are fewer output frames meaning that less data travels across the bus. Therefore, the data spends more time in the GPU where it is needed. The benchmarks I've seen for 4k Ultimate quality scenarios show minimal overhead loss (~5%, I think?) due to the external chassis. And that seems like a very acceptable loss IMHO for this solution.I am just reporting what others have told me or what I've seen online with these approaches. If someone has better firsthand information, please correct me and share with us. :)Edit: Here's an example from eGPU.io:  https://egpu.io/forums/builds/2022-14-asus-zenbook-14x-space-edition-12th14ch-rtx-4090-32gbps-tb4-razer-core-x-win11-23h2/[–]ShidellA51MR2 | Alienware  Graphics Amplifier | 6900 XT [score hidden] 7 hours ago(2 children)There is a performance loss, but it is really game dependent, and ranges from nothing (or nearly nothing) to perhaps 10% in the worst-case scenario. You can't compare the AGA to TB3/4 eGPUs, because they have additional overhead being part of the PCIE bus, sharing resources with other devices, whereas the AGA has a direct PCIE 3.0 4x connection to the CPU, which is good for ~4 GB/s of throughput.[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 [score hidden] 7 hours ago(1 child)You can't compare the AGA to TB3/4 eGPUsExcept that you just did. :)Thanks for the additional info![–]ShidellA51MR2 | Alienware  Graphics Amplifier | 6900 XT [score hidden] 6 hours ago(0 children)[–]NKCellMX[S] [score hidden] 3 hours ago(3 children)Sure: https://www.3dmark.com/spy/34500768https://www.3dmark.com/sw/242439[–]ShidellA51MR2 | Alienware  Graphics Amplifier | 6900 XT [score hidden] 3 hours ago(0 children)Nice!

      "content:  i recently acquired a rtx 4070ti oc series (great deal, 750 usd) and decided to give it a try with my to-go setup; i have to admit making it work was a little trickier than expected, and decided to share my experience for anyone interested; the card and aga are even recognized in awcc. my rig: alienware graphics amplifier alienware m15 r3 (intel i7 10th gen 5.0 ghz; 2 x 8gb, dual-channel ddr4, 2667 mhz; geforce rtx 2070; windows 11) pny geforce rtx 4070 ti 12gb xlr8 gaming verto tf oc rm850x — 850 watt 80 plus® gold certified fully modular psu benq ex2780q (1440p - 144hz & 4k - 60hz) before plugging the 4070 ti to the aga, i had to dismount the lid from the graphics amplifier in order to fit the card properly. this process is quite simple and only requires a phillips screwdriver to dismount; you need to remove 12 screws before being able to dismount the complete mechanism (don’t forget to unplug the fan and the alienware logo light from the aga’s motherboard). after removing the lid, i removed the stock psu in order to accommodate the rm850x in the same place and decided to mount the card. ​ top view after removing the lid on my first try, the aluminum plate surrounding the video output connectors made me impossible to properly sit the card into the pci connector (more specifically the three dents in the back), for this reason, i removed the six screws holding the plate, and then, the card was able to sit and fit properly into the pci connector; in order to hold in place such big card, i inserted a temporal angled screw to hold the card onto the aga, and so far it works great. back view (with angled screw) side view front view after fitting the card and plugging everything to the rm850x, i connected the aga to my laptop updated with the latest nvidia drivers, and turned it on (the card was also connected to the display benq ex2780q via hdmi). at first, card light were on, fans were off and was not outputting video; after checking in device manager, the card was being recognized as “microsoft basic display adapter” and displaying error code 31. i decided to do some research and followed the guide by u/shidell here: https://www.reddit.com/r/alienware/comments/nk718z/the_state_of_the_alienware_graphics_amplifier_in, however the card was still being recognized as “microsoft basic display adapter”. further reading of experiences around the aga in this and other forums, made me even try the plug and unplug technique proven to work by some users with the 3000 series (https://www.dell.com/community/alienware/pci-e-3-0-x4-for-ampere-3080-3090-question/m-p/7894720#m43691), however i had no luck until i did the following: uninstalled awcc using revo uninstaller (advanced scan and deleting found entries is mandatory after uninstalling) restarted system uninstalled nvidia drivers restarted system installed the chipset inf utility restarted the system located the following subkey in regedit hkey_local_machine\\system\\currentcontrolset\\control\\pnp\\pci generated the hackflags entry with a value data of 200 as depicted here (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/error-attach-pci-express-expansion-chassis) reinstalled nvidia drivers using the latest package restarted system the card was still being detected as “microsoft basic display adapter”, so i uninstalled the nvidia drivers restarted the system generated the hackflags entry with a value data of 400 as previously described (this value worked for me) reinstalled nvidia drivers restarted the system after restarting, the card was outputting video and recognized as nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti reinstalled the latest awcc restarted the system after restarting, the card and aga were also being recognized in the awcc ​ aga in awcc card recognized in device manager important notes: the hackflags entry never worked for me until i uninstalled the nvidia drivers each time i modified the subkey; for this reason i suggest testing systematically the 200, 400 and 600 values always uninstalling and reinstalling. apparently awcc can interfere with process since i tried everything depicted below and it did not work until awcc was uninstalled. the aga and card were connected to my laptop the whole time i hope anyone finds this useful, cheers.\n",

      "content:  hey! i am considering picking up a new alienware m15 r7 off amazon and am tying to figure out what would be the best specs and ssd upgrade for gaming before i pull the trigger on it. i am torn between 2 different m15 r7 specs: intel core i9-12900h, 32gb ddr5 ram, 1tb ssd, rtx 3080 amd ryzen 9 6900hx, 32gb ddr5, 1tb ssd, rtx 3070ti i know these laptops can run hot but i hear that the amd cpu and 3070ti will run cooler then the intel cpu and 3080. i have also heard the performance difference between the 2 cpus and gpus is pretty minor. lastly i was wondering what would be a good m.2 ssd upgrade for the second slot? i'm thinking of getting a 2tb ssd but have some questions. i have heard that some people experience crashes and the ssd disappearing while playing games installed on the second ssd slot. https://www.reddit.com/user/jelloooj/comments/vz5bml/alienware_m15_r7_second_ssd_compatibility/ have any of you encountered this issue? i saw one thread where someone suggested the motherboard won't support the bandwidth of two gen 4 ssd at the same time so a gen 3 might be a safer choice for the second slot to prevent the crashing issue but i haven't seen anything to confirm this.\n",

I may consider it.[–]bluesky3242 [score hidden] 21 hours ago(0 children)Yeah, I noticed Razer's quality has dipped over the years, I had an OG Mamba in 2010 that lasted 7 years, then tried the newest version in 2019 and ended up returning it. Logitech mice feel and perform a lot better IMO and have more variety than this mouse. As for keyboards, the Alienware keyboard appears to have cherry mx low's so it will be fine, but if I were spending that much money, I would probably spend a bit more and go custom. Examples below: Those are a few examples that I found after a minute or two of looking that are probably better quality and more unique than the Alienware pieces.

Some batteries will last longer based on how you use it and maintain the laptop. My 15 r4 had its battery changed recently and before it would not be able to start up if it was above 20% and then it went to 50%. So I switched it and it last significantly longer than it’s stock one when it was new. It used to last 4hrs and now it can reach 6hrs. That being said, it might be the case that your battery didn’t have the best of health when it was inserted. My new battery from dell says it’s only 95% battery health. While the old one said it was around 80 but acted like if it was lower. A battery swap May be the trick to get it working better than it is but it is also something you can get a replacement from dell if you have the plan with them[–]DA-ZACHYZACHY[S] [score hidden] 10 hours ago(0 children)Yeah I generated a Windows Battery Report and the original battery was below the reported 86 Wh when the device booted.

If you don't do this, it will lead to erroneous installation as the installer wouldn't have the proper privileges.  Install it, then reboot.

The X15 has way higher power limits on the GPU, so your gaming performance will be far better. Slightly more ports, more RGB, more screen real estate and it's not that much bigger than the 14. I wouldn't go higher than a 3070 Ti though as the 3080 Ti can be a huge upcharge.[–]Abdo83[S] [score hidden] 22 hours ago(0 children)Thanks a lot..

Dell was our preferred vendor for PCs.We didn't deploy Alienware laptops to the audio engineers.  The audio engineers got Macbook pros.  Their equipment and tools worked best on OSX.  They did all their mastering and mixing on OSX, submitted their audio assets in version control, then did all their coding and validation on a Windows workstation with a GeForce GPU.  The guys working on art and textures didn't mind Windows for their work.  None that I recall ever begged their leads for a Mac instead.  We had more requests for Wacom Cintiq displays than we did OSX.  Mind you, that was six years ago, so things may have changed.

I must say though that it doesn’t deter me too much since sound is more of a personal exploration for me, which I only delve into for personal projects. Maybe I’m underestimating things? 🙈In your experience, and I’m not sure if they need to render videos enough in a gaming environment to justify Avid; but if they do, does it work well on Alienware?

You don't put paste on the VRAM as a standard thing.At the most you'd have thermal pads, but only on higher end cards that run their memory harder. With your card, the GPU core is likely to be the limiting factor.You'll see airflow over the VRAM from the gaps in the heatsink, which will be adequate for that model of card.On higher-end cards, there'll be a separate contact plate for the VRAM and the VRMs, and there'll be thermal pads on all of them.[–]Safe-Yam5138[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(1 child)Thanks. Yeah I would never put paste on memory. I was just thinking they would at least have thermal pads because they do generate heat and that's usually what I see when I work on laptops.

If you look, the fins are close, so they channel air over the chips, without needing to make contact.Is it a super-efficient fantastic design? No. Does it need to be on that class of card? Also no.

I had no idea this could fit. Didn’t even consider checking if anybody pulled this off given how massive the 4070 Ti turned out to be. Almost felt like I would have to settle for a 4070 in my R11.How are your temperatures looking like and is it fitting properly in there or did you have to mod / bend something beyond moving a fan ?I am still hoping board partners to push smaller 4070 Ti models though. The card could easily be 3cm shorter.Guess you will need an AIO now that air flow is completely restricted by that gigantic card.\n",

Since you went with Nvidia, I would opt for a cooler in that case. The AMD with the 6850XT card has a newer cooling chamber that does a great job, but from my previous experiences with Dell and Nvidia, dell wants to cool that sucker off externally if you can.If you find something that works, let me know, please! I might still actively cool it, too, to see what my temps stick at.At my previous place, my home office was a closet too, so I know the real-world troubles of running a hefty machine in a tiny place!

Mine has never looked as drastic as yours, but whenever I see some edge or corner bleed, if I lightly press on the frame or panel itself right where the bleed is, it can be made better.Not saying this is a permanent fix or it will help in your case, but it has helped me for the slight areas I've noticed on my panel.[–]Grimace1918m15 R7 AMD[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)I tried pushing around the plastic bezel and it didn't fix it sadly.It's noticeable on pictures like my wallpaper the colors wash out. The reason I made the post was dell had a technician come out and while working on the computer he broke the IR camera while replacing the motherboard. The original problem was gpu was overheating and even after motherboard replacement it still overheated. So a week go by and another technician comes out and he replaced the MB and heatsink assembly. I contact dell before the second tech came out and ask if they could just order another IR camera and have the second tech repair it and the dell rep says he placed the order but when the tech got here he didn't have the camera assembly. Then the second tech get done and he points out how bad my display is bleeding because I normally use a external display I didn't see it. So he called dell and asked if he could swap the display and camera but dell refused and said I need to send the laptop back to the depot. So now I'm stuck with either a bad display or without a laptop for 2 weeks.\n",

So here is how to do it properly, when you do it properly there is no such question as \"is this enough or not\":DO NOT try to simply put a ball on the paste on the chip then squish the radiator on top of it and hope this works. It won't. It will form an excessively thick layer of paste which will worsen the thermal transfer, or even worse it won't cover all parts of the chip which could make the chip heat unevenly and crack due to significant differences in thermal expansion between parts of the chip.[–]terekkincaid -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago(0 children)Guys, he's just trolling...[–]66698 -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago(0 children)You forgot to dot the corners[–]murfiAurora R10 AMD -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago(0 children)i find it hard to estimate with a blob like this.i prefer to spread it thinly over the entire surface.but i suppose with a blob of this size you will be grand, there will be plenty squeezing out to the sides.[–]Gigakbm15 R7 Intel -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago(0 children)PS: if i am wrong please let me know.\n",

Like an actual study!https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07861When the modulated light source is spatially uniform, we obtain a contrast sensitivity curve that matches that reported in most textbooks and articles. Sensitivity drops to zero near 65 Hz. However, when the modulated light source contains a spatial high frequency edge, all viewers saw flicker artifacts over 200 Hz and several viewers reported visibility of flicker artifacts at over 800 Hz. For the median viewer, flicker artifacts disappear only over 500 Hz, many times the commonly reported flicker fusion rate.Huh - why it is almost like in the right conditions you absolutely CAN see the effects over 500Hz.

It's just with RAID-0 losing either SSD would lose the whole array, whereas with AHCI or RAID for individual disks, you'd lose what's on that specific disk only.AHCI actually performs less well than RAID does, which is probably why Alienware ship these systems with RAID enabled.

My only concern would be the air pressure changes if you have liquid cooling. You've got a sealed loop, but there's going to be a pressure difference between inside and outside.[–]nickierv 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(2 children)Your going to get some funny looks but as long as it fits in the overhead compartment, they can't say anything.I had to fly a midtower (generic gray box case, so that probably helped with sizing as it was really, really close.), just make sure all the dimensions fit. I got a $10 thick mattress thing to wrap it in on account of sharp corners, that made it just too big to fit into the scanner but I just unwrapped it for that and everyone just shrugged. It technically fit with the padding and I got the people who could see spending 2 minutes and allowing a repack to not break there very expensive hardware. It was a very AM flight, so having everyone fresh probably helped a lot.As for the overhead, there is a little hump, once you get it over that it just fit. It took a bit of wiggleing but it seemed to fit better than all the other luggage that people had.Just make sure the GPU is snug (AW has some nice supports for that) then just double check things when you get to your new place. I had a few fans wiggle loose in a different system I shipped, but that one ran a bunch of HDDs and mid case fans to get more air and those came loose.Other than that? Just the normal precautions for moving a system.[–]jayday1991[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(1 child)Thank you for your input I appreciate you reaching out. And the tips on packaging it.[–]nickierv 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)Not really, I always pull HDDs drives if I'm moving a system more than in the room, but but I'm running 8 or 9 drives, best not bumping them. But if I'm traveling I just toss any storage in my backpack. Hardware is trivial to replace, data not so much. For all the issues with AW, GPU support isn't one of them. Make sure the GPU is snug with the little support thing. It might be possible to get the GPU loose but questions will arise as to how without sending the system into a wood chipper. The rest of the internals have a good enough weight to snugness factor that they don't really come out unless your being just stupidly abusive with it. Maybe cut off a little scrap of cardboard (cereal box is a good source) to put over any ports or catchy bits just to keep things from getting caught in them., little bit of tape and your good.But the big one is just keeping the case from getting scuffed up in transit. A sheet or 2, something padded, etc. The system I flew with didn't have a box but the size is so tight it wouldn't have fit anyway.[–]smokingcigar 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)Why not just ship it to your new address?[–]Loud-Job7030AREA 51 R2 | M15 R2 | AW610M | AW558 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)Yes!

You just need to buy an adapter to mount a 2.5\" drive/SSD into a 3.5\" bay. Again both 2.5\" and 3.5\" drives use the same exact SATA power and data cables.The only SSDs you couldn't use in those bays are NVMe & M.2 SSDs.[–]1234okie1234X17R2 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)So...

      "content of comments: (2 children)AW is very, very picky when it comes to RAM. Also from everything I have seen, AW can't run tight timings. Put the original sticks in, get HWinfo, use that to check the timings. Your looking for this (https://imgur.com/JLHfvxF) page to start with, bottom right side of the first screen under memory.The kit you got is cl22, bottom shelf 'make the GB number go up' RAM. I don't want to say I'm surprised that it ran at all, but its going to be a nightmare trying to get it to run fast. Mixing RAM isn't that big of a deal, unless its in an AW. RAM tends to just work, unless its in an AW. Good RAM is good...unless its in an AW. There is a trend, and its the AW MB. So your fighting that from the start.You can't just toss otherwise good RAM into the system as well, it will run at the slowest speed of everything, and the stuff that ships with the system is probably bottom shelf 'make the GB number go up' RAM. 3200cl19? Just guessing. So in that case a new otherwise good 32GB 3200cl16 RAM will at best be running 3200cl19. Probably the best thing to do is send back that 32GB RAM and get a single set that will fill your needs. Pull the AW RAM out and just use your new one. That way your only fighting the MB and not the RAM as well.[–]Digs31789 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago(0 children)Second everything said here. I would also just return the crucial RAM and stick with the ram that alienware gave you or buy more from Dell at an insane price.

Note that those final digits are in Hexadecimal, which means that the numbers go from 00 to FF, so DB is MUCH newer than the v44 you are running. Once that is working, make sure AWCC is updated and change to Performance for the Thermal setting and OC 2. That should give you a very good balance of CPU and GPU for games in particular.For me, I've seen a 20%+ improvement in Time Spy, etc. with these settings.Good luck!PS I also turned off advanced optimus in my bios, but that might not be necessary since the iGPU wouldn't be used by the benchmarks using your dGPU anyway.

Also, just fyi, the 3080 Ti should be boosting nearly as high as 175 W in games, it’s not 140. Frankly, I’ve noticed a similar issue where the GPU just isn’t using enough wattage, especially at 1080p. Idk if the algorithm just doesn’t want to feed it power because it doesn’t think it needs it, but I have tested other laptops and haven’t quite had this issue. For example, I’ve tested a Legion 7 and a Helios 300 and both have a 3070 Ti, and always hit 150 W in games. I think it has to do with Dell’s power allocation profiles. I think at the end of the day, you just have to put up with the louder fans. Almost every other gaming laptop I’ve tested uses some sort of performance mode, which cranks up the fans. It’s just the way these days with gaming laptops.[–]chiboul_[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago*(1 child)Hello, this is all set to QHD (both internal and external monitor) even though my X17R2 has a 4K monitor.\n",

Using a 125 - 150w vbios is not close to double the power. The only wildcard is VRM temperature, which will bring the system to a crawl if it overheats. I've never found a way to monitor this. Agree, you're insane if you're flashing and using 24/7 a 165w vbios onto a 100w (with dynamic boost) 3080 non-Ti for example.[–]Pembs-surfer 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago(6 children)With a bit of tinkering these X15’s R2’s can run at blisteringly fast speeds.

I've been running the same 175w vbios on my x15r2 without issue. It's a very nice boost in performance. My Timespy graphics score jumped to 14,335 when OC with Afterburner, and Blender OpenCL is over 4000 now. When gaming though I don't use \"full performance mode\" or 175w, keep it at 150 - 160w, it stays below 80 degrees for the most part.http://www.3dmark.com/spy/34059142You can also use the 150w vbios for the M15 r7 which also works.The target base power on both of these is 125w versus the paltry 90w in our stock vbios. The jump in base power from 90 to 125w makes much more of a difference than the jump from 140-150/175w. That's the main reason why I've flashed.I cap the CPU at 45 watts TDP in ThrottleStop to give more thermal headroom and not waste power on CPU. Didn't expect to love the x15 as much as I do. It's a powerhouse now and performs as a 3080 Ti system should.[–]jlp0209X15R2 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago(0 children)Already downvoted it seems, haha. I always acknowledge the risks of flashing. If you don't know exactly what you're doing and don't research prior to doing it, and want to be spoon-fed, yes you deserve to brick your laptop and learn an expensive lesson. No one is forcing people to flash, and those who do so blindly, not my problem. Once you've read up and researched and accept the risk, take the red pill and try it.[–]appleandplumX17R2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(3 children)Thankyou for the thorough explanation! Where can I confirm the base watts on the x15r2 is 90W? I heard rumours about this before but it’s not documented is it? Also what AWCC settings do you run the laptop on then?Additionally do you have the m15r7 bios for 3080ti i912900H? Does the m15r7 3080ti run to 150W?Thanks[–]jlp0209X15R2 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago(2 children)You go into GPU-Z and click on the \"Advanced\" tab. Then select \"Nvidia bios\" in the drop down menu. It'll show the default and maximum TGP of the GPU. Try it on your stock vbios, you'll see the 90w base power target. That's why at stock it underperforms generally speaking.I use my own custom fan profile, I think the fans go to full speed when CPU and GPU hit 75 degrees.Here's the 150w vbios, not sure about the CPU type though. Yes, at full power it runs at 150w.VGA Bios Collection: Alienware RTX 3080 Ti 16 GB | TechPowerUp[–]Sweaty-Barber1971 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago(4 children)Can you please private message me and send it to me[–]appleandplumX17R2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(3 children)You want the x17r2 vbios or the m15r7 vbios?

If you're moving from the US, you'll be moving from a 110v grid to a 230v grid, and the power supply will have to be able to handle that or it won't work. That is usually printed directly on the label of the power supply. If it does support 230v, you'll just need a new c13 cable to plug into a european outlet, or an adapter.[–]hulyemacska[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago*(0 children)Yep, that’s what I meant.

Check on the label on it though, to make sure it states \"Input voltage: 110-230V\" or similar.

When you're counting to 30, it's easy to think you've got there long before you have. Try it again, and set a timer.If it still doesn't work, you'll probably find you need a new motherboard. I wouldn't pay a shop to deal with that; I'd just find one online somewhere and fit it myself. Dell have fantastic manuals for their systems, and if you head to the support site you'll see a full service manual with every single step (and a bunch of pictures) for how to dismantle and reassemble your system.That being said, a new motherboard may well be cost prohibitive, and it may be worth looking at replacing your system instead, depending on how much money you want to throw at your (presumably 5-6 year old) system...[–]hulyemacska[S] 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago(1 child)Thank you so much, I genuinely appreciate your reply. You’ve been more than helpful!! :) I’ll try again and if it doesn’t work then I’ll look into getting a new motherboard. I couldn’t afford to replace the system right now unfortunately, but once I’ve saved up, I’ll definitely consider doing so as your estimate is right and it probably is around that age (I bought the PC off someone so I wouldn’t doubt it’s quite old now).[–]DJUnrealAlienware 17R4 / Area51 R4 / Aurora R10 / x17 R2 / Aurora R15 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago(0 children)No problem!

Really stinks you're in this spot. I had a similar issue awhile back and it can be frustrating when BIOS gets corrupted or something happens to the motherboard. Sounds like you've tried to get the BIOS recovery to kick in with no luck. BIOS resides on the mobo - it basically acts as the startup manager: clock configurations, fan speeds, power on rails, etc. So if you're experiencing BIOS/ROM failure, that could mean either a) bios is corrupted and therefore you have a bricked mobo or b) there's a configuration issue with the BIOS memory (ROM = Read Only Memory). If you haven't done any updates, then it most likely is a hardware issue...i.e. your motherboard is bricked/toast/dead. A few options to go from here:Let me know if you have any questions. Once again, real sorry you're experiencing this.[–]hulyemacska[S] [score hidden] 12 hours ago(0 children)Thank you for your reply, this was very helpful. I truly appreciate it :) 🤍\n",

Check the max temps. I would guess if it's dusty then it's a temperature thing since the computer runs really hot to begin with and has inadequate cooling.[–]nickierv 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)Also get MSI afterburner, that can pull GPU loads and info as well as CPU loads, perfect for figureing out if its the CPU, GPU, both, or something else.  Space Engineers is an interesting one, are you getting performance dips just floating around or are you dealing with massive amounts of stuff? That sounds like a CPU issue.Check your RAM usage, 64GB is sort of hard to fill but just covering bases. Also make sure the GPU is running gen4x16 speeds. You might have to look up the speeds but HWinfo can pull the GPU bus speed and you can work from that.Turn off all the Dell/AW software, it has been know to cause \"minor\" performance issues *cough* 30% GPU load *cough* for what is effectively a web page. It might also be some semi rouge software that is kicking on. That is a lot harder to track down so lets check for hardware stuff first, but keep 'interference from other software' in mind for laterWhile your checking temps (HWinfo), also have a look at the CPU power draw. AW isn't following Intel spec for 12th gen K CPUs in regards to power settings. It might not be a big deal for gaming but i9, so check it anyway. It should be peaking to 241W (give or take 5 for software measurements, but it should be close).And check the CPU clock speeds, an i9 is super easy to cool...if your only running it like 200MHz. Heck, you might even be able to do without a fan at all at that speed!You need temps, power, and clock speed to really get a good idea of performance, else you can end up with silliness (200MHz i9) but also heaving issues cover other issues, say 95C but only 180W and 2.4GHz vs 90C, 241W, and 5.2GHz.\n",

I'll start using that cooling pad duh. I just read to turn off optimus for added frames in games I would wonder if that could be giving me audio issues. I'm in support with Dell and the TV's in a service plan too its just really annoying. The TV's great for features the panel is 120hz and GSync(I'm assuming thats outdated?) with 2 HDMI 2.1 ports. I know for certain I need to enable the enhanced format to enable the 120hz from the input. My other option's are Dobly Vision format and VRR but both limit my hz options. I'd rather have the 120 hz with the games I play its really why I bought the TV. I saw some driver logs saying the HDMI sound driver failed to enable but this was before I updated the HDMI sound driver and anyways the audio is still cutting off regularly. I've been wondering if it would help to keep the laptop display enabled as that's what the TV does when switching to Audio system which is what I toggle to get the sound working. I sit in front of it and it could cause performance issues in FPS games. I probably wouldn't do that. It freezes the system(laptop) when I switch that TV setting about 10% of the time. Idk who to call first and the laptop has so many features as well as Sony's smart tv's are super google enabled while being super sony enabled I have no idea what device or setting to be suspicious of.[–]Pembs-surfer 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(1 child)You will get less frames pushing through HDMI to a larger screen with increased resolution. The GYSNC display is effectively GYSNC low latency and VRR already so resolution and size aside it will perform much better than most TV’s other than higher end OLED panels I.e.

      "content:  hey i posted here pretty recently about using external drives with my alienware laptop and i got really helpful incites/advice. i'm what you call tech savvy while being tech illiterate; i can follow instructions and learn by example. i'm having a ton of issues keeping my external display outputting sound from my laptops hdmi. it's a sony x85j it has some pc friendly features(including g sync!) but i'm worried because it's a tv i need some serious setting configuration on both my laptop and tv. i'm going to call dell but i got some intermittent sound from a xbox series x so i am worried. the series x seems to be working no problem now but the laptop will frequently cut out and i have to use sony's weird \"audio system\" choice in audio output to fix it. when i switch to this setting my laptop screen turn's on(its disconnected per norm) and upon switching back to my tv speaker(all of this being done on my tv settings) i regain audio. my hope is still that dell with step me through fixing this issue due to that the audio cut's out the most when opening a new program or changing what i'm doing. sonys best advice without contacting their live support told me to take a look at my hdmi output in sound settings. the article i read wanted me to make sure i was using a supported audio frequency but seeing as i can get sound to come through the tv as much effort as that may be didn't make me think this was the solution. the hdmi output driver is listed as a separate device than my sony tv (which generally shows up as a generic pnp monitor) and there was a driver update needed for the hdmi digital out but i had the cutout happen since. nvidia control panel didn't have any options to configure that i could tell. i have the enhanced mode set for the hdmi input on the tv. if i set it to standard mode the audio works out the box(another sony support suggestion) but i wouldn't want to keep it this way because i lose my 120hz at 4kish pc display setting in nvidia control panel and the same 120hz option in the windows display settings. i will do a factory reset on the tv to be sure but there's so much going on at this point i'll call dell first and have them be part of the overall troubleshooting. also the audio settings show that there's output to my tv and even with the tv volume all the way up and the same for my windows volume settings i don't hear anything my laptop is playing(when the audio cutout has happened. so all that and now to my main question/reason for posting; also anyone who has a quick fix speak up please. does anyone know of a way to run this laptop with the display closed? i saw a prominent youtuber say the laptop shouldn't be run closed lid(i'll post his yt in the comments) due to airflow output near the keyboard. i think i ran it a few times with the lid closed and the dust got pretty bad and quick. i'm just wondering if i could use it normally with the laptop shut forcing only the external display would i be as likely to have the audio issues? i have a cooling fan pad but it only blows upward so i haven't been using it because there are fans that blow out from the bottom. my specs are 3080ti, 1080p 360hz laptop display, i912000hk, 64gb ddr5. i have a 65inch sony tv model x85j for my hdmi port and a dell g3223q for my mini display port. both stay connected but the dell is disconnected in windows settings as is my internal laptop display. i run the laptop open lid sitting on a not in use cooling pad. my room temperature is around 70 and the laptop is located less than 3 feet from my sony tv. my hdmi cables are new and already been replaced once(to test cable fidelity).\n",

The m15 R5 allows for more wattage on the GPU giving you better performance. However, the pure “newness” of the components in the X14 will probably make up the difference. You’ll get better build quality, but less upgradability. Make sure if you do make the jump, you use some good coupons because the X14 will be expensive at launch.

No one can say if you need warranty except you.  It's impossible to predict a failure, so it's not like anyone can say that yes you should get it at a certain point because you may need it.  As for the damage, if you upgrade to accidental coverage then it would cover that, but as the damage happened before you had the warranty ( provided you don't have that now ) it probably wouldn't be covered.  If you do have accidental now, and you extend it, then it should be covered and they will fix it.    My R13 only came with a year, I will likely extend it before it expires, but the desktops also seem to be cheaper for warranty then the laptops, for whatever reason.

You can limit this using TCC in the offset in the BIOS to cap it at 85c, with a minimal loss in performance.  A few people also have this weird issue where the GPU will drop performance until you unplug the laptop and plug it back in, it's an irritating bug that I have been dealing with for quite some time, but can't find a solution for.

Some (maybe 4 and probably 8TB) SSDs use dual sided PCBs so they are about 3-ish mm thicker than single sided drives and those may cause issues (some systems are so thin they have to flat mount the drives and double sided don't physically fit)There is a thing with formatting: MBR can only support ~2TB while the newer GPT format is limited to a couple million TB (so unless your trying to back up the entire internet your going to be fine, the practical limit is the max capacity of drive you can buy)No idea where the manual is getting a 1TB max drive from, it looks like that laptop uses 4th or 5th gen Intel, I can't see it not being able to do GPT formatting. If you want to double check you need to poke around in the BIOS. Start in drives and look for mentions of MBR or GPT. If you change a drive it may wipe the drive (just be careful) but if your just looking to expand storage you can stick a big drive in and format it to GPT, nothing on the drive to loose, so no issue.[–]frozen_sea[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)Thanks!\n",

The problem with most modern software: the trained monkeys writing the stuff have it default to load on boot, bloat, bloat, bloat, and soon you can't open a notepad without 32GB RAM. Open task manager , go to the processes tab, sort by memory usage and work your way down the list. The first time you do this your probably not going to know what half the stuff is, but you can right click on the process and there should be an \"open file location\". That should give really good hints as to what the thing actually is. Leave anything in system32 alone, that stuff tend to break things in a hurry when closed. But the worst \"oops\" your going to have is if you crash the system by turning off something that was needed. Restart the system and everything is good.You can also turn off some things in the Services menu. You might be able to soft brick the system if you turn off something critical here (just go back in in safemode and turn stuff back on and your back to normal). But services aren't going to add all that much, maybe leave that alone as a last resort.Probably the big one is all the loaders and stuff you don't really think about. Just looking at the probably common ones, Discord, GOG, Epic, and Steam are all about 0.5GB each. Got a mod manager running? Another 0.5GB. Chrome tab? 0.5GB. Okay, chrome isn't that bad, but it just shows how fast you can fill RAM.[–]coffee-bottle[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(1 child)My biggest task is the anti malware service executable, at 3 percent, but it won’t let me end the task. It just keeps saying access is denied. I’m not at all tech savvy, do you know what’s up with this?[–]nickierv 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)There should be a setting in the program that will disable the anti kill feature. And you may have to run something with admin, the whole thing gets messy when the supposed anti malware software starts acting like malware...But if its going that far, possibly some other stuff going on in the background. Its possible to go in and gut the OS of bloat, but its a bit of a nuclear option. Try closing it from an admin account, if that fails you can use a different OS to flush, say the anti malware .exe file, the entire folder, etc. That tends to fix issues. Odd how say a linux live boot gives 0 flips about what windows wants. But before you do that, add up all the other stuff that is running, it might not be a single big thing but a bunch of small stuff eating RAM. And if push comes to shove you can always do a fresh OS install. Its a bit of a pain but it should flush most stuff out. If you do this, get the OS installer from MS, don't reuse the AW one else your back to square 1 with the bloat.[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(0 children)Yes, of course it is. Windows will cache as much as it can over time to speed up the operation of programs, games, etc. In RAM intensive games, Windows will shuffle off the unused data. You would also want to close any unnecessary programs running in the background if this becomes a problem. Windows can't tell which running programs are important and which aren't, of course.\n",

Find something that meets your requirements and at an acceptable price point for you.[–]nickierv 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(2 children)As long as everything works and nothing goes wrong, its fine to buy a used AW (or hardware in general).In the real world, your going to have parts failures. AW is not known for having easily changeable parts that will last a decade under load. They have a growing number of proprietary parts (mostly the MB) that can be interesting to deal with (just ask anyone looking to swap RAM in an AW system: lots of 'should work' and 'some success' vs 'yea, just toss in anything')And the really, really big one: make sure you don't spend more on less. The hardware listed is ~4 years old and mid tier. $90 for a single 8GB stick of RAM? You can get 32GB of 'budget' (and its faster than that 8GB stick) for $80, 16GB for $40. 1TB SATA SSD? I can get a near top end 2TB gen3 SSD and have change from $200. But with that said, if the price is right and something ends up needing replacing, be sure you can harvest the old system for parts for a new one. 2060 isn't amazing, but its a solid card. Call it $150. RAM rarely fails, it might be slow, but older games? Sure, plenty fine for that. Couple TB of storage? That's $150 you don't have to spend later. Probably $400 in easily harvest able parts. If they are asking $500, meh sure. Asking $800? No, I can build new (so warranty) and more modern hardware for $830[–]Professional_Toe1440[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(1 child)Great advice and insight, thank you.  He’s asking $400 in total.  I think the prices he listed are what he paid at the time.[–]nickierv 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(0 children)$400 total is good. Even if you had to swap in a new MB (they tend to be the major point of failure in systems and get very hard to find as time passes), call that $130, new case $70, new (good) PSU, $80, your looking at a solid last gen gaming system that will probably see a third life as an office/media system for not even $700.For all there faults, Dell is good about the GPUs and a coin flip about the PSU (either top prebuilt PSU if not for the proprietary nature, or the PSU that launched a thousand 'prebuilt PSUs suck' memes).\n",

The power limits are baked into the system bios. You can't adjust them unless you use some tool that escapes my memory. And even then it's tedious and not guaranteed to work.[–]That_Ambassador_9 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(0 children)As others have said, it's not so much the CPU/GPU and power brick that are the issue here, it's everything in between them. The board will just not allow you to draw additional power beyond the design limits.[–]Mx-Alienware 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(2 children)I believe the battery will make up for any potential extra power draw beyond what the charger can provide. edit up to the board power limit of course.This is why you can see battery drain on high powered laptops running at max capacity despite being plugged in. If I’m not mistaken, the bigger PSU will reduce that battery drain potential at your max power requirement.[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(0 children)Unfortunately not all the time.

The new m16 & m18 coming out this year comes with 330W power brick even though the 4000 series RTX GPU is more power efficient and has the same TGP as the 3000 series. I think that's a real flaw in the whole design. I wonder what Alienware has to say about that. Why starve the machine with a limiting power brick?[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 3 points4 points5 points 4 days ago(1 child)The laptop will only pull what it's rated to pull, you can't just feed more power to it then it's designed to carry.[–]National_Upstairs136[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)From the power ratings the GPU (140W) & CPU(115W) when maxed out can pull more than the power brick (240W) can provide.[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(1 child)You won't max them both out at the same time, the cpu will pull wattage away from the GPU.[–]National_Upstairs136[S] -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago(0 children)Now that's the problem.

The worse gpu on paper, as you put it, is much better suited for accuracy and speed on rendering native 3D. I just don't know how your machine might present the data to the gpu to crunch.There's a reason precision machines cost as much as they do. And it's all about the pure reliability and intent of use.[–]Maggaen95 12 points13 points14 points 4 days ago(0 children)I'm going to advice the opposide of DJUnreal here. You want an air cooled version for fewer points of failure, especially for a 24/7 on machine which is mission critical. The liquid, pump, and fan in a liquid cooler are all possible points of failure, and it's better to replace those with a singe fan on an air cooler, which is only one point of failure.[–]_Sweep_ 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago(0 children)It’s a cool idea and will probably work fine even though they’re designed for gaming. For an always-on computer though, maybe check the power consumption too.[–]JohnMundelAurora R13/ Aurora R4/ M15R5 2 points3 points4 points 4 days ago*(0 children)I agree with the comment of DjUnreal , moreover the white chassis and dimmed RGB light might inspire trust in the machine, as if it was a brand new medical device.[–]kpauburnAurora R10 AMD 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago(0 children)I think the R10 is fine, but make sure you get it with liquid cooling. It makes a huge difference.[–]waldojim42 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago(0 children)I am going to pass on the same advice I usually do for these sorts of things: but a machine built to the task.Meaning, get a workstation. They are designed for 24/7 operation. And they are designed for sustained loads. They are not built to game.They may be very non standard. But this is the nature of such things.I can tell you, I work in an office of hp z series workstations. From newer z8 machines back to z600… they all work. And keep working. Optical drives have failed at least once in them, but that is the worst complaint we have.And they all had on site support for 5 years. They aren’t cheap, but machines designed for 24/7 operations and long support aren’t.Too many threads on Reddit of someone complaining their gaming machine toy (and yes, they are toys- they are not designed for work- they are designed to be played with) are failing prematurely, overheating, etc.Ultimately, you do you. Just keep that in mind.[–]SamueleffinB 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago(0 children)Would get the precision besides you can add more GPUs and crossfire them. The precision should have a Xeon processor and is better suited for heavy use with heavy workloads, not to mention it's hard to put a Business Pro service warranty on an Alienware, not impossible, but more difficult. Besides WX Pros of the GDDR5 variety are cheap and some configurations can have up to 3 or 4 of them in a crossfire.[–]DJUnrealAlienware 17R4 / Area51 R4 / Aurora R10 / x17 R2 / Aurora R15 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago(0 children)It should last a long time. Just make sure you get the liquid cooled version and you'll have no problems at all.[–]Ok-Drive-9685[🍰] 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(2 children)My Alienware R10 out of the box was basically a safety hazard. The CPU would get very close to max temp under like 30% load. I added new fans and some Thermal Grizzly and saw a slight drop in temps. It wasn’t until I discovered undervolting that I saw results. Now CPU almost never goes over mid 50s. If that modding is not in your wheelhouse might be better to look elsewhere.[–]Crypto_Dent[S] 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(1 child)Yeah I know how to undervolt so if I end up getting the r10 I’ll look into doing that.

      "content:  hey guys. i'm a huge alienware fan, and have an m15 r7, 3070ti for my personal use. i recently took over a dental office and bought a cbct (3d x ray machine). the processing on computers needed to view and manipulate these images is fairly graphics intensive. the manufacturer recommends an i7 processor and a 2gb graphics card. i was looking at refurbished dell workstations and they are honestly the same price as a refurbished alienware r10 (and with the alienware i get an amd radeon rx 6600 xt 8gb gddr6). do you guys think the alienware will last for years to come working in a dental environment. the graphics card will barely be used (not every day, and for like maybe 15 minutes at a time max), but the computer itself will obviously be used and on every day, but it will be extremely basic computing. think it's worth it to get the r10 or just get a dell precision ( amd radeon pro wx 3200 4gb gddr5 (4mdp to dp adapter), low profile). they are both the same price refurbished. ​ thanks guys!\n",

About 65 to 70% of it goes to Dell, the rest is to HP and Apple.  It is quite simple to join the vote of the 6 people that wanted HP to become the primary vendor for Windows systems last year over Dell.  There are 15 people that vote on that board and I am sure I can get others to change their votes.  Dell has pissed me off for the last time.

He does not want to lose millions of dollars in business so stop wasting your time with support and contact him. I would think that a guy buying millions of dollars in computer products from a company would have already thought of this.[–]zdevilinside[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago(0 children)He told me that I have to go through Dell/Alienware for it because the way our contract is written.[–]CrimsonLoki 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(1 child)Oh hey welcome back, saw your post a while ago complaining about Dell/Alienware, was wondering what happened. Sorry it ended up being another negative experience with them. Although, you still like to pull bragging rights like last time (not saying you can’t do those things though). Idk how you haven’t already called up Dell upper management with those connections. As a normal customer, I have managed to reach upper management twice about my devices and got them replaced/repaired without a hitch so maybe try that? With some more insistence I mean.[–]zdevilinside[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)I have tried all the people I know in the supply chain for us.  They told me that their hands are tied.  I mentioned to them about my votes and how much impact having me pissed off at them could have on their bottom line.  They had the goldfish eyes and said that I surely wouldn't hold this issue against them.  That was when I mentioned the doubling of the hardware failure rate in 2 years for equipment at work and how they are now above HP in device failures.  I am beyond angry with Dell now.  I already told coworkers that I am NOT going to support Dell from now on.  A few asked me why and I pointed to the doubling of the failure rates, poor customer service and how it was an issue we had discussed last year where Dell was barely selected as the primary vendor. By the way, preliminary #s show that Dell's failure rate increased last year whereas HP's dropped.  This is on the business line systems.  Prices for the systems are comparable and hardware is virtually the same.   Dell has a 30% higher rate than HP at present.  It just makes sense to change due to the increased total cost of ownership for Dell's.I informed my clients that we are going to start purchasing HP systems instead of Dell from now on.  Their response was quite telling - \"Okay, so we pick the box under the Optiplex from now on.\"[–]bubdadigger -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago(8 children)If you have a copy of your chat with a rep - and you should always save a copy of it - when you tell them that you will be out of town or to prove that no one told you 'bout new system shipment, then it shouldn't be a problem to get a new system if someone will grab yours. When I got in touch with Dell rep less than a year ago 'bout one bad ssd screw on brand new laptop they sent me a brand new laptop without even asking. Two days later I received shipping confirmation and that was it. So yeah, I guess reps don't give a crap 'bout anything.

It died within 5 days.  I sent it back for repair and got the run around about it.  At one point, I wanted to talk to a supervisor.  They transferred me to a line that rang for 4 hours straight with no answer.  (I waited the 4th time with it on speaker as I worked and that is when I let it go for 4 hours)After 5 months of constantly fighting with them over it, I told them to either refund my money or get me my system back ASAP.  They sent me a laptop but it didn't recognize any hard drives.  They said that the drives were bad then.  I told them that the drives are perfectly fine - recognized and able to be used on several different systems.  After arguing for a bit, I was transferred to a manager who told me I must not know what I am talking about when I say the drives are perfectly fine.  That is when I told them I was a senior engineer for Seagate and I probably know more about hard drives than he and the rest of his call center combined.  He hung up on me, I filed a lawsuit, and 3 days after they were served, I got my money back.[–]alizzleableX17R2 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(4 children)That’s pretty much why I don’t buy their devices despite a lot of the features, definitely not appreciate of the customer service situation.

New systems are using what's called \"Windows Modern Standby\", or S0 sleep state, rather than the older S3 sleep state. The point of that is that Microsoft want the PC to wake up when you're not using it, to do Windows Updates and the like. There's a great LTT video on Modern Standby that they released recently, which explains it in more detail.It's by design, from Microsoft, and it's because they want your PC to behave more like a console or mobile device, which does updates in the background when you aren't paying attention.Welcome to the future...[–]Intelligent_Top_7806[S] -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago(6 children)I appreciate the info but it seems having a PC perform these checks 15 to 20 times an hour is overkill. From the little I know about Modern Standby is that it appears to have been designed for laptops in an effort to conserve battery power. However, if you put your laptop in Sleep Mode, having it turn on and off is counterintuitive to saving the battery. Just my opinion.[–]DJUnrealAlienware 17R4 / Area51 R4 / Aurora R10 / x17 R2 / Aurora R15 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago(5 children)It's not about battery saving. It's about getting stuff done when you aren't using the system. You've completely misunderstood the point of it.I agree, it's a terrible technology, and really doesn't work the way it was supposed to work, but unfortunately it /is/ the way it's designed, and it's an MS thing that they need to fix.[+][deleted] 4 days ago(4 children)[deleted][–]DJUnrealAlienware 17R4 / Area51 R4 / Aurora R10 / x17 R2 / Aurora R15 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(3 children)I hear you, and agree with you.

I know it’s takes like 2-3 seconds more to boot up but it may fix this. I had this problem on my x17r2. Then eventually it stopped doing many cycles. And it would just not sleep. So hibernate works for me.

The pad is made of encapsulated gallium-silicone, and its designation is Element 31, because gallium is element number 31 on the Periodic Table.”[–]daaangerz0nem15 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(0 children)I dug around Google and it sounds like that stuff is just normal paste with a hint of Gallium which performs barely better than regular paste. This thread has some discussion on it.[–]Maggaen95 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(0 children)Element 31 is a mix of liquid metal and standard thermal paste. It doesn't perform much better than standard thermal paste though, in fact many of the posters on this subreddit has experienced better thermals by swithing to a quality paste like kryonaut.[–]Maggaen95 -1 points0 points1 point 5 days ago(5 children)What kind of testing have you done to identify the problem? If you haven't done anything else than what is mentioned in the post, you might want to start by booting up a cpu stress program like cinebench, let it run for 10 min, and observe the wattage and temperature of the cpu in the duration of the run. If it drops to something like 55w and stays at 100c, using the performance profice in awcc, you probably have a thermal throtling issue.Depending on the speed of the drop in wattage and increased temperature, it might be problems with the contact (likely ue to thermal paste) or dissipation issues (usually dust, but might also be failing fan(s)).[–]sauzumX17R1[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(4 children)I don't see the point on testing with cinebench and stuff because I don0t have a mark from when I bought it so I can compare, it's a feeling.​I remember when I was doing very light stuff like web surfing, most of the time the fans were off completely, now it is very rare this happens, and I'm talking about basically twitter with the room at 17º at most.[–]Maggaen95 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(3 children)I just told you the point though. There's very little to be done by feeling, especially when asking for help from others online. The reason testing with a cpu stress program is helpful is that we get a glimpse into the throttling behaviour and consistency.  To put it simply; assuming there is indeed a thermal throttling issue, that may be bacause of 1. dry thermal paste, 2. incosnistent coverage, 3. uneven contact pressure, 4. leaking/dry heatsinks, 5. failing fans, 6. dust buildup, 7. physical trauma to any of the parts involved with cooling, 8. failing vrms, or insufficient cooling to the vrms. There is no way to seriously diagnose the issue if you refuse to post the results of standardized tests.[–]sauzumX17R1[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(2 children)Again I can test but I will get a mark that will be meaningless because I don't have an earlier one to compare. The purpose of the post is to ask people that did benchmark their x17 shortly after buying it and 1 year later to compare, if there are people that confirm there was a drop in performance then I can tell mine has that also.[–]Maggaen95 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(1 child)You seem to be misunderstanding something, there isn't an objective x17 r1 thermal/performance profile. This is for several reasons that will take me a bit too long to explain, but it will be of no help to you to get a reference from someone who've just bought their unit, or have data from the time they just bought it.You seem to be experiencing an issue with your unit, so diagnosing and trying to solve whatever the issue may be on your unit is the only possible way for you to solve the issue.  If you only want to know if people experience a drop in performance, then yes, they do, this is entierly normal. Normally due to drying thermal paste or dust buildup, or a poorly maintained operating system (installing bloatware over time), and/or a number of other less common factors. Still, this information is not helpful in actually solving your issue.[–]Sh4do3Fox -2 points-1 points0 points 5 days ago(0 children)Did you try undervolting your CPU?\n",

The others are just way too overpriced. I hoped for a good X14 upgrade since I like the portability but it's 85W 4060 simply won't cut it compared to the 125W 4090 of the Asus G14. So this year the G14 is still the better option.Also, keep in mind that the X series is thinner but not really smaller or lighter so I don't know how much portability you gain from it but also lose performance/thermal headroom on the other hand. The m series also uses the new cooling solution and seems to be completely designed for max performance so it's the way to go imo[–]nqthomas[S,🍰] 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago(8 children)Ok, Thanks. I have an old Alienware that ways a ton in a half and it’s time to upgrade I think. Do you know anything about the desktops? I don’t know what color has the RGB on it.

However I'd strongly advise you not to get an Alienware desktop. They're even more overpriced than their laptops and there are definitely cheaper options out there with better hardware and of higher quality.That's just one video of a highly regarded tech youtuber but many share his opinion. I've seen people here drill holes in their 5k PC so that they can exchange the stock fans. (something that shouldn't even be necessary if a case has enough spots and follows mounting standards) \n",
      "https://youtu.be/UnvxSkqJ8icEven the new cooling is way too weak for the high end processors they're offering.If you want I can create a part list based on your budget and games and then you can either build it your own or let somebody else build it for you like best buy etc. Or you can build it your own it's not really difficult and you learn a lot.

      "content of comments: (7 children)I don't think Alienware really has a \"flagship\" anymore.  You have two product lines, one that is powerful at the cost of size and features and one that may have less power but is lighter and has newer features.  Perfect example is the first X series had the quad fan design, which is now on the M series, while the X series has moved onto other stuff.  Dell kind of shot themselves in the foot on the initial X vs M thing because the launched the M series in the 15 inch , but the X series 17 outperformed it, so it didn't really make sense they way they did it.  Now we have the M18 and it presumably will outperform the X series based on the CPU specs and cooling capacity, but time will tell.  In the end it will come down to the user needing either power or size / weight.[–]cornezy 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago(0 children)And that's exactly what confused me and OP.

Both the x-series and m-series are there to cater to different audiences. Essentially x-series is all about thin and light, whereas m-series is all about performance. Both perform great, but the m-series will be thicker, and probably have slightly better cooling and performance as a result.[–]SuperSpartan300m15 R7 AMD -1 points0 points1 point 5 days ago(6 children)Specs aside, I've tried many X series laptop and returned all of them as their cooling just can't cut it with today's fast CPUs.

The M series however has a thicker body, not sticking to a thin form factor which allows for more thermals maybe? And i think ram won't be soldered on an m series motherboard so..yeah i think if you're solely focussed on non compromising performance then I'm thinking the M16 would be the way to go\n",

If the updated drivers persist downgrade to the original driver windows gives you and try to install it again. Also try 1080p or 720p instead of HDR in the settings.

You could probably also create an image and upgrade both drives then restore it, but I have never done that, so I can't say what the exact process there would be.  I believe some programs will allow you to backup and restore a drive into a non-raid state after the fact.  If that is an option you can back it up, break the raid, add in a larger drive and then restore to that drive.\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)First of all get a copy of service manual. It will show you step by step what you can do with your rig.Secondly read the tech spec. All m15 R6/r7 has two m2 slots that you can upgrade. Usually it comes with 2230 512GB boot drive in slot one and with empty slot two. Which means you can install a secondary m2 SSD drive without messing up with system clone and such. Both slots can accept up to 2TB m2 SSD 2280 form drives each, total 4TB.If I am not mistaken, R6/R7 accepted up to 512GB m2 SSD in 2230 form (small one) in slot one. Also keep in mind that slot one (where the boot drive is installed) is PCIe 4 and slot two is a slower PCIe 3. What it means is you can buy a fast 1 or 2GB PCIe 4 boot drive and slower - and cheaper - 2TB PCIe 3 storage drive. You can install PCIe 3 SSD in slot one or PCIe 4 SSD in slot two, but in the first case scenario your twice faster slot will deal with a twice slower drive, and in the other case your expensive and fast PCIe 4 drive performance will be cut down to PCIe 3 slot speed. I have 980 pro 1tb as a boot drive and 980 pro 2tb for storage on m15 r6. Both are PCIe 4, but last BF the price for 2TB was too good to pass on it.[–]nickierv 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)First, probably the best 'how to computer hardware' video I have seen, as it covers everything: https://youtu.be/BL4DCEp7blY?t=2746 Its for desktops, but the process for installing hardware is the same one you find and uncover the correct spot on a laptop.With the 'how to' covered, lets talk drives. Gen3 vs gen4. The use case for gen4 drives are mostly servers, raw 4k and up video editing, multi user data access... Nothing a laptop should really be doing. Also keep in mind gen3 drives run a bit cooler than gen4 drives, its not a major issue, but laptops need all the help with cooling (or less heat in this case) that they can get. A good gen3 is just about Also of note, >2TB drives will work as long as they fit. The manual is suffering from a case of 'we didn't specifically test that specific hardware, therefore not supported'. But the drives themselves are comparable as long as the double thickness (you need chips on both sides for capacity and that adds like 3mm or so, enough that clearance may be an issue on a flat mount) isn't an issue.As you have 2 slots, your best option is probably just add a second drive. A common setup is OS (and core programs, thing web browser, text editor, etc. Small stuff your always going to use.) on one drive (programs have a habit of dumping data into the OS drive so that will fill over time) then putting all the programs on a second drive. Then for desktops that have more ports, bulk data on HDDs (cant beat the price/GB of spinning rust)For drive selection, I tend to stick with WD or Samsung as everyone else seems to have there hand in a cookie jar and is just a matter of when they get caught (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K07sEM6y4Uc&ab_channel=LinusTechTips on the component swapping). 970 evo plus, SN750/770 should be reasonably cheap but well preforming drives. Yes you can get a 1TB for just over $60, but then your probably going to be using a bottom bin controller, no cache, hopefully not QLC (its a little cheaper but a lot worse than TLC) and suddenly a high end HDD is outperforming your brand new *fast* SSD. Ummm oops?100-ish is about as low as you want to go for a good SSD, but you might be able to snag ~$20 off due to sales. A good drive on sale is still a good drive.\n",

I don't even know if there is a 16x10 4K option, there was no QHD thin bezel option for a long time, that's why we lost it after the Alienware 17R5 for awhile.  The 17 has been replaced with the 16, which is probably pretty much the same size anyways, are you really going to notice the 1 inch difference?  Larger track pads, return of the SD card slot, return of the light up track pad....they brought back a lot of things people have been asking for. They announced 4 new models that cover basically all ends of the spectrum, so not really sure how \"this is it\" really covers that.  If they didn't announce what you were looking for then other brands may have something else that you like, but 95% of the time the other brands all end up on the same page as well.  Someone already said other manufacturers are going to release 18's as well.  Lenovo already does a 16 and almost everyone has a 14 now.  Also not sure what a \"proper\" display is, but they have the X17R2 with every disaply option currently available if you want 4k that badly, but personally I think QHD is MUCH better suited to a laptop anyways.[–]ORayZ[S] 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(3 children)And what about the screen quality? 300nits max doesn't make a justice with that...Is there gonna be an updated X17, anyway?[–]acastic 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago(0 children)300nit displays should be a no go in 2023.

I did this through a batch file application on an iso and now my pc wont start. I’ll explain more if needed[–]cruisin5268dAlienware 17R5 5 points6 points7 points 5 days ago(3 children)So, you got something that’s made for a very specific (and outdated!!) version of Win 10 and tried to force it into Win11?  There’s your problem right there.  A quick look at Atlas and it’s very clearly for a specific build of Win10My best advice to you is reinstall Win11 and forget about this atlas shit.  Running outdated and unsupported versions of Windows opens you up to security risks.[–]coolestsp00n[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(2 children)How can I do that and without loosing all my data (1.9tbs of games)[–]cruisin5268dAlienware 17R5 5 points6 points7 points 5 days ago(1 child)Well you backed up all your data right?  Certainly you wouldn’t undertake a serious modification of your OS without protecting your data because that would be seriously foolish. So, just restore from your backup.  Otherwise you’re going to have to get a bootable system recovery tool to try to back up your data but a lot of games won’t be saved by doing this.   With steam and EA it’s super easy to back up the game files, assuming you have a working system of course which you don’t at the moment so you’ll have to do so manually.[–]FreeFormFlow 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(0 children)So you took a Dell PC and installed a completely different OS than the manufacture shipped it with?[–]coolestsp00n[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(3 children)<image>I have this stuff what do i do in bios to recover it[–]OfficialTornadoAlleym15 R7 Intel 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(1 child)You need to power cycle it by holding power button for 20 seconds, turning it on for 30 sec, repeat 3 times, and support assist should pop up.[–]coolestsp00n[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(0 children)It only has tests on it last I checked what should I do i’m there[–]cruisin5268dAlienware 17R5 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago(0 children)Yeah that’s OS recovery.

I mean MSFT owns the OS if AtlasOS could somehow speed up Win wouldn't MSFT do it themselves?  It's not audited for security, it disables every basic PC functionality, disables Windows update(worst) making your PC attack hotspot. And it's old. I hope you learn from this and don't install random stuff. Remeber, if you need to modify OS and don't know what it does or how it does, STOP.  Now to answer your question, Create bootable Linux USB(Ubuntu should work). Bootup the drive. Connect external drive and copy the game files to external drive or secondary drive if you have any. If I were you I would just redownload everything as you don't know if something is affected by malware/virus/rootkits. Once you have your gamefiles moved to a different place. Create a bootable drive with Windows 11 ISO. Reinstall the OS and move the gamefiles back to Windows. Installing games is tricky. Normally you just start the install from whatever launcher. pause the install, copy the game files and resume the install. Launcher will pickup the existing files and skip redownloading the whole thing. Steam, EGS allow to restore from existing game intallation directory.   This however requires you to have a second computer handy. If not search, dell bios recovery. It's basically few button combinations to boot into Dell recovery partition. This will restore the Windows installation your PC came with. If somehow you managed to mess up that parition as well, you will need borrow someone's machine.   Ask me any followup questions.[–]coolestsp00n[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(0 children)I’m going to try this right now, if i have to reinstall games I will.

See Rule #8.Best bet is to offer it on Facebook Marketplace.  Cash and local pickup buyers only.  Refuse any overpriced offers begging you to ship overnight; they are scams.  Do not accept a cashiers check, it's likely forged.   Prepare to get spammed with such scams and \"iS tHe ItEm StIlL aVaIlAbLe?\" without ever saying what \"The Item\" is.As for pricing it, generally with a 1 year old used PC the value is between 1/2 and 1/3 of its original purchase price.  At least for computers that don't have an Apple logo on them.As for buying a gaming laptop.  You could probably pick up a good secondhand gaming laptop for a couple hundred more than you sold the desktop for, which you could probably find on Facebook marketplace.I'm not the most up to date on USD -> CAD conversion or the price differences between countries so I can't provide good advice on buying new.

Do I need better ventilation (is the cooling just a bottleneck for laptops)?I was hoping a seemingly higher end PC like this would work pretty seamlessly out of the box for normal gaming, disappointed to be having performance issues (graphics on High, not even ultra or ultra+)[–]T-Trollm15 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago*(0 children)You have 85% GPU load at 71C, so it's not a bottleneck.First, check we are right about SSD - install HWINFO or Libre Hardware Monitor and check max. SSD temperature then playing (there are some ways to check it from command line using WMI, but it's tricky).If it's really 75+ - check SSD heat shield installed correctly and lay on SSD controller chip good. You may need to replace the heat shield or move SSD to other slot if not.Additionally, run some heavy SSD tests to check basic performance - it should be according to specs. You may need to replace SSD if it's controller/flash degrade.PS: There are some way to nerf GPU performance by incorrect settings in Nvidia control panel, but in this case it will degrade globally (from the game start) and GPU loading will be higher.[–]JoeSnuffie 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(2 children)I had 2 Dell laptops do this and both were related to thermal issues. One had a bad SSD that was overheating everything and the other, an Alienware M17 R3, didn't have any of the screws holding the cooling system down. Yeah, quality control . . . In the first instance I returned the laptop, not wanting to even deal with it. In the second instance a tech came out and replaced the cooling system (just in case it deformed or the cooling plates were dented) and added SCREWS!The thermal throttling was easy to detect using the Nvidia on screen stats. Once the GPU temp hit a certain point it would throttle down to 300mhz and rarely increase again after the temps went down. this would take me from over 200fps in a game to about 10fps. Screenshots and a video is all that was needed to get Dell to fix it.[–]IcyMammoth[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(1 child)The thermal throttling was easy to detect using the Nvidia on screen stats.

But to be honest I may just go for a 3080 anyway both ti and non ti look like they will be cheaper options the non ti version will save me £200 at least and I can get FE versions refurbed with 2 years guarentee and I know they will physically fit the enclosure and are proven to work. The 4070 was tempting due to the power draw being lower to save hassle of swapping out PSU's but the 3080 should still be ok with the stock PSU I guess the ti  will be pushing it. And if I go for the standard 3080 then I will save a nice chunk of cash. This may be the sensible option.Thanks MogRules[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago(0 children)But I have seen reports of the 4080 and 4090 working,Nice! I have not seen that yet, but it's good to know it does.  There was a lot of concern that Nvidia wouldn't certify the drivers to work in the AGA.

If you do get it going with a 40 series be sure to come back and let us know :)[–]bagofwisdomm15 R2 1 point2 points3 points 6 days ago(3 children)2.5 slot card ain't gonna fit.  I have a 2.25 or 2.12 slot 3070 and it wouldn't fit with the lid closed.  The card worked fine with the lid opened up as long as I had the 30 series driver installed on my M15R2.  I thought about buying a mATX case and modifying it to accept the AGA internals, but couldn't find one I liked at the right price.  You'd need a drill, tap, and motherboard stand-offs to do the mod.  4070Ti should work if you can live with the hood up on the AGA all the time.[–]Beeblebrox-77[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago*(2 children)TBH to play it safe, to save some money and hassle. I may just go for the standard 3080 as it is proven to work with about a 5 - 10% loss of performance on the Area 51 which I can live with, and the FE version will fit. Should be plenty for my 1440x3340 monitor and VR requirements anyway. TBH the 2080 super does a ok job at the monitors native resolution and VR but some comprimises are needed you cant just push every slider to the right on some games. And I am only running a Rift S for VR so if I want a higher res headset.....I can do the MODS required with no issues for a larger or more power hungry card but due to mainly laziness I would rather just plug and play lol. I intend to play with the lid open for extra venting but it would be nice to close it when not in use to stop dust.Thankyou for your response and insight.[–]bagofwisdomm15 R2 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(1 child)3080 FE should fit no problem.  You have plenty of length, a little bit of room for height, but no more than 2 slots' worth of width.  My Aorus 3080 definitely won't fit in the AGA... It just fits in my Enthoo Evolv Shift mini-ITX case.[–]Beeblebrox-77[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(0 children)Thanks again for confirming the fitment, there is also a EVGA XC3 3080 which is even cheaper than the FE which I am also pretty sure will fit. But will probably go FE just to be safe.[–]ShidellA51MR2 | Alienware  Graphics Amplifier | 6900 XT 2 points3 points4 points 6 days ago(3 children)You can use whatever GPU you please, as long as your PSU can service it completely (depending on what you choose.) I've seen at least two members here using 4090s successfully; I haven't seen any results of a 7900 XTX, but I should have one arriving tomorrow and can report back if you'd like with results.[–]Beeblebrox-77[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(2 children)Please do report back with your results it will be very interesting, If I can find a 4070ti which is small enough to fit without modding I may still go that route. But the 3080 is tempting me more and more atm.Yeah I have also seen reports of the 4090 working which is very cool but not really seen any gaming benchmarks, I do not spose you know how much of a performance drop people are getting with the much more powerfull card compared to a similar desktop config due to the bandwidth constraignts. I guess the more power the card has the bigger the performance difference? like I can cope with a 10% perf drop vs desktop and a 50% uplift vs (2080S) at the cost I can do this with a 3080. But does it get to a point if you push the card further where you will get huge diminishing returns?[–]ShidellA51MR2 | Alienware  Graphics Amplifier | 6900 XT 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(1 child)Theoretically, you're up against two factors: a CPU powerful enough to push the GPU you select, and the PCIe 3.0 4x bus connection from the CPU to the GPU in the AGA.The Area 51M R2, using a desktop CPU, really shouldn't be bottlenecked by the GPU—at least, not in the traditional Nvidia driver overhead sense. Obviously, a 10700 (or even a 10900K) is going to bottleneck a 4090, but you aren't considering a 4090.The second factor is the bus speed. In my experience, I've seen (at worst) approximately a 10% performance loss as compared to a desktop. Generally speaking, games load the majority of their data (textures) ahead of time, and the AGA is able to move data at about ~4 GB/s, which means that on a GPU with a 24 GB frame buffer, it can fill it in 6 seconds... and I'm not aware of any games that use that much RAM right now, nor need to completely fill it. Instead, games tend to stream data in as needed, and 4 GB/s is still really, really fast for that. Depending on games, there can be some loss, but in general, it provides a fantastic (and by far and away, the best) eGPU solution, still.Once I have the 7900 XTX installed, I'll get some figures and send over an update.[–]Beeblebrox-77[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago*(0 children)LOL I was thinking of upgrading the CPU to a K version mainly so I can unlock my RAM clocks. When I decide to repaste I will definatly do it, But I'm not worried about a CPU bottleneck on the cards I am considering and the resolutions and settings I plan on using. It was more the bus speed that concerned me but as I said I can deal with 10%. My thinking was would/does a 3090/4070ti drop by say 15% for example because of the extra saturation. (edit and would a lower VRAM cache make a difference to how many textures would need to be streamed from the A51)Anyway thankyou for your insights and I am sure your upcoming results will also prove very useful. The auction on the AGA ends on Friday so will not be GPU purchasing till then maybe someone will get a 4070ti working by that point :)[–]aya_hua_sca 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(1 child)i am running a 3090 FE, with a Seasonic Focus 750 installed.if you don't mind shaving your AGA a little bit here and there - it's gonna work just fine. get a 3080ti and you will not regret it.[–]Beeblebrox-77[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago*(0 children)Nice, yeah a 3090 has also become a option for me at the same price as the 3080ti. But will probably just stick to one of the 3080 cards. Because if I am not satisfied with the AGA performance uplift I will probably build a desktop pc out of the card so would be nice to leave the AGA casing unmodded, then I can sell it along with one of my Alienware laptops as a package deal. But a PSU change if needed for the 3080ti is easily reversable.Could you give me some details of performance you are seeing? Which laptop have you got it plugged into?Thanks for your input.[–]Beeblebrox-77[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago*(0 children)Update, 1st thankyou to all that have contributed! all of your comments have been very useful.After looking at the availiable 4070ti's and evaluating cost I have decided not to go that route everything cheap has already been sold and the slimmer ones are top end of the prices atm.So a 3080 or 3080ti it will be! but I have seen a 3090FE for the same price as the 3080ti all of them are FE models. But to be honest it will probably end up being the standard 3080 due to cost and not having to mod, it is at least a £200+ saving (without possible PSU swapping with the bigger cards).I am still the only and highest bidder on the AGA (£100) willing to go 50% higher if needed,12 hrs left and as most normal people here in the UK will be asleep for 9 of those it looks like I may have it.Kinda excited to do this and get testing on both my laptops. I will provide data like Gaming fps and benchmarks like timespy for both the A51 and my M17 R4 (i7, 3070). Hopefully this weekend.\n",

      "content:  hi all, i have decided to superchage my a51m r2 (2080 super, 10700, 32 gb) with a aga but still undecided which gpu to put in it? may try to find a 4070ti to put in it as soon as they go on sale over in the uk (which is in a few hours i think), its tempting because of the lower power draw and 3090 performance. but if the 4070ti's turn out overly expensive or out of stock i will probably go for a 3080 or a 2nd hand 3080ti. anyway does anyone have any thought's or tips on the subject?. the gigabyte aero 4070ti that i have been looking at is a 2.5 slot card it is the smallest i could find, should that fit with no case modding? i have heard that other people have got the 4080 and 90 cards running so hoping it should just work concerning drivers etc (fingers crossed). also the 4070 ti draws less power than either the 3080 ti or non ti so guessing a psu upgrade should not be needed.\n",

The new one has only a 2k screen with a marginally better refresh rate, and 300 nits.  Having more power at a lower resolution seems kinda pointless, I wanted the extra power to play 4k games at 60-120 fps on max settings.  Like I can already play games at 2k at 120+ fps with a 3090 so.... seems like a lost opportunity.[–]Teckx1 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(0 children)I have the same thoughts and use the same screen and X17[–]cornezy 1 point2 points3 points 5 days ago(4 children)That's a great point.  For me,  I use mine mostly as a desktop.  (51m r1) so the screen is secondary to me,  as I use the 34\"qd-oled. And when I'm gaming on the laptop,  I think screen size to resolution is perfect for the normal eye at that distance.  I think Alienware 1, is cutting corners a bit (still has a 720p webcam).  2, wanting customers to crank up the graphic settings on your games to take advantage of the 165hz.  Or 3, doesn't have a manufacturer for the screens with better specs.  Either way,  expect to see a mid year update with more screen options for sure.[–]greakath 2 points3 points4 points 5 days ago(2 children)Also I think Dell really screwed over the area 51m users by giving them a highly implied ability to upgrade gpus that never manifested.

I think that will come and when it does, I'll probably leap.  But all the other models available give people options to go smaller, go thinner, and balance what makes you happy.  That's just nice for everyone.Then remember to let others try first and see reviews if you aren't sure.  Right now we have no tests, minimum specs, too many variables.  Let's worry more when we have real machines to size up.[–]Ssj925 1 point2 points3 points 4 days ago(4 children)As someone who owns all the 18” Alienwares and the Area-51m, I agree I am a bit disappointed that they’re using the m chassis instead of x. More so I am disappointed that they are using 2 speakers (left and right sides the front “vent”). I am not sure if it has a subwoofer but it better have one. Why the smaller X16 has a 6 speaker setup but this one doesn’t I wonder what they were thinking. If it’s performance shows it was worth going m chassis then maybe I can forgive it but we’ll see. I am ordering one on day 1 and hope it’ll be good.[–]Cheeseman1018[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(3 children)Yeah that is what I am thinking.

The area-51m can’t match them at all because of no subwoofer. I really hope we get some more info on the audio system. Even one subwoofer will make a huge difference vs none.

      "content:  i was excited when i seen the trailer for the alienware m18. my thoughts was, this is the return of the mothership back in 2013. after seeing some videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yvl-4il1ou - all credits goes to engadget i am in a mix bag. 16:10 aspect ratio looks promising with the higher refresh rate as normal and the upgrade storage availability. i feel alienware could of done more to the m18. to me it doeis not seem like a replacement of the a51m as it had its own platform. for example, it set itself apart from the other alienware which only came with 17inch only. while the m18 has the same design and chassis as the m16 (excluding number keypad). secondly, its not as bulky as i hoped for where i am thinking the x series ,is the slim form factor and the m series is more beefy , thick chassis (it looks flat and slim/thin) there is no tobii eye tracking camera but its got a full hd web cam. i thought the tobii tracking is gimmick but came to realise, i do like it when returning to screen, dims/brights the screen. speakers: seeing pictures and videos, i cant seem to locate where the speakers are located. i would think its at the bottom of the laptop. on the other hand , alienware x16 has six speakers and dolby atmos audio. i think the x16 is probably going to have better speakers than the m18. some wouldn’t care as they mostly have headphones plugged in but for some like myself, i like to play through the speakers. in short, the m18 will be a replacement for the current line up m17 but i don’t think it is for the a51m.this is my initial impressions of the alienware m18. i just feel alienware could of done more to make the m18 more unique and stand out from the other series line up. the x16 series is going to cost more for the base configuration than m18. maybe in future, dell/alienware can create a sequel of the a51m.\n",

      "content of comments: (3 children)As long as physical dimensions fit, any off the shelf aio should work, the stock ones are just branded aceteck ones and a few others rent and the same so relatively simple.Ram...board. AW is notoriously picky with RAM. Start with Kingston and crucial and do some research on ram speed and timings (timings are critical!!) as bigger number is not always better.SWPro4 fans look really good, if a bit pricey. Should work just fine, maybe even not throwing errors.[–]pdechavez[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(2 children)Thank you for the advice! I’m currently on the RAM situation so I’ll definitely do my homework there.[–]nickierv 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(1 child)I can give a bit more info on the RAM.Everything comes down to how fast the system can feed the CPU fresh data, aka memory access time. Lower is better. AMD sees a lot bigger gains than Intel, 8-10% vs maybe 1-3% for the same RAM upgrade. Workload matters, gaming might not see lots more FPS but should see more consistent FPS, simulation stuff (even simulation games) are going \"Feed me data!\" and can see major gains. So everything will see gains with better RAM. Is it worth spending 6x the price of a solid budget kit on top shelf? It can be with the right workload.Memory access time is measured in ns, you can crush the numbers from both the transfer rate and (often conspicuously absent) cl# using something like https://notkyon.moe/ram-latency.htm 10ns is doable on a budget. 7ns is high end off the shelf. You might be able to get lower with a lot of tweaking, but call 7 the top end.Access time is like a jar, how fast you can twist the lid (transfer rate) and how many twists (cl#) Its no good to double the speed if you have to also double (or more than!) the number of turns needed. 3200cl16 is 10ns, 3600cl18 is also 10ns, usually for about $10 more.AW seems to run both really slow (4800 vs 7200, and thats not even top end) and high cl (36-40). That works out to something like 12.5+ns. That sort of looks good until you see 5600cl28 (10ns) for cheap or 7800cl36 (<9.3ns) for the high end. Higher clock speeds need more power, are harder to keep stable, etc. Between 5600cl28 and 7800cl36, the later has better silicon, so even if you had to drop both to 5200, you could squeeze a lot more performance out of the better silicon, at least in theory.The AW issue seems to be a mix of super cheap RAM (not a good look for a premium system, but solvable) and a MB that just can't run good speeds or tight timings (really bad), and from what some people have reported, its almost entirety the MB, so take all the above with the approximately size pile of salt.[–]pdechavez[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago(0 children)Wow, this makes a ton of sense.

Also when it says high end configuration in the article, what's the baseline for it generally? Thanks.[–]jlp0209X15R2 5 points6 points7 points 7 days ago*(5 children)The current x14 only has a paltry 75w TGP 3060 including dynamic boost, so hopefully they'll increase the (4060) to 100w or higher.I'd assume \"high end\" means 4070 or higher in the x16 and x18? Not sure I'd pay $3099 USD for an x16 equipped with a 4070...that's just nuts. For $3000 it'd better have at least a 4080 with decent TGP.I'd think the current gen m15 would drop in price once the next gen launches, but if you can wait then wait. Best recent example was the Lenovo Legion 7 Gen 6. It dropped to $1799 if I recall with the (full 165w TGP) RTX 3080 version when the Gen 7 was launching.In my opinion, if you are in the market and need something now and want a great deal, the best purchase is a current gen laptop with highest specs right when the next gen launches. There are bound to be some great deals on outgoing 3000 series laptops.I snagged a refurb x15 r2 w/ 3080 Ti for $2600 a few months ago from Dell outlet; flashed the GPU to 175w (mainly to take advantage of base 125w and game at 150-160w) which should last me a long time.The only reason I'd upgrade is to get the 16:10 display.[–]maybsofinitely 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago(2 children)Thanks for the input! I'm not in a hurry really, I'm just afraid the price going down won't be as much as the current discount I see right now (250$ off + 10% discount upto Jan 5).[–]jlp0209X15R2 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago(0 children)Can't predict how much it'll go down as you know. Either way you'll get a solid laptop. The m15 r7 is fantastic regardless of what haters say about it. Especially the AMD version which gives you great battery life and has 10w more on the GPU if you opt for the 3070 Ti compared to the Intel version. This year's x14 / x16 and m16 look incredible too, despite the x14 really not appealing to me at all.I saw on a CES fact sheet that the new x14 will have an 85w TGP for the RTX 4060. If that's the case it is way too low for the asking price, in my opinion. If the Blade 14 can manage 100w on the GPU, with vapor chamber cooling, there's no excuse for Alienware.[–]Heliosvector 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(0 children)If you are looking for deals, look to lenovo.

The gap to the G14 becomes even larger. Will be like a grand cheaper in Europe as well.[–]PixelizedOneAlienware 13R3 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago(0 children)Yeah. Actually had the 2022 G14 and the X1 at the same time last month. Returned them both. The G14 was because of a clicking fan noise when you start to game - but that screen was nice.The X14 had a better keyboard (except for the backlighting of symbols) and the 1080p was actually quite comparable to the G14 (resolution aside). Returned the X14 because the keyboard backlight was not working. It also had a higher pitched fan noise but was cooler (lower spec components). Just saw Jarrod’s video on the G series. Too bad the G16 is Intel only right now. I am interested in the G14 - Nvidia with all the new tech would be better than the 2022 G14 with AMD. Wonder what that price will be though.[–]LoneAmerican 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago(0 children)Yep selling my x14...I took it out of the box and never used it.

How are these \"dolby vision\" laptops at 300 nits brightness? That doesn't seem possible. Dolby Vision specifications are \"Peak brightness: at least 1,000 cd/m 2\" and 300nits peak brightness is not even close to within range.​Everything else though, fantastic![–]Etherite11 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(1 child)The GPU TDP is gonna be very low due to its size at least.

      "content of comments: (5 children)Dell classifies the M series as the powerhouse and the X series as more of new feature machine.  The confusion mostly comes from the fact that the M series came out with the M15 and the X17 easily outperformed it due to a higher TGP on the GPU.  This has shifted again now that the M17 is out, the newer M17 ,and presumably the new M18, do and probably will have higher TGP's to at least match the X series.[–]cornezy 1 point2 points3 points 7 days ago*(4 children)I found myself asking this question as they released the new x16 and m18 today.

If you google or youtube for videos then ensure all drivers are up to date. Usually when your machine gets shipped it is from a certain date which is probably some months and drivers can be out to date.Since you seen a blue screen it could be either a software/hardware.

That will likely fix it.[–]lGuzerkerl[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(1 child)I'm currently doing a factory reset. Would I have to try redownloading the video card drivers additionally?

I never give the service tag info out. Gave it out once,  many years ago,  and someone was able to get the laptop switched into their name.  I was able to get it all reversed,  but was surprised how they managed that without any other info of Mines.  People always ask for it first too.... but normally it's from someone with a new account which raises my suspicions. Speaking of new accounts,  I do not sell to new users. Like the others have said,  be honest in pictures and descriptions.  I don't allow refunds,  as people are too comfortable and fickle using refunds from Amazon and other places and try to make returns because of anything these days.  (I'm not trying to deal with that hassle?)Generally I accidental warranties on the laptop so the customer feels better about the purchase because they will be covered for a year or more and for accidents. Otherwise,  what's stopping them from buying refurbished or something from Dell?!?With fees now I don't feel ebay is the way.  10% final value fee plus 10% shipping cost.  Also being reported on taxed on it..... you will have to sell it for more than you probably could sell it for, to get the final price you want.  This all makes it very hard or compelling a choice.  Also ship it Signature required so theres no funny business on the purchasers end.

      "content of comments: (3 children)You will lose airflow, which is pulling fresh air in to the system.  As a result, if you remove the fan ,you will see much higher temps and even overheating.  Your fan is loud because the system is hot and it's trying to cool it off.  You may be able to swap the fan out with a quieter model, like a Noctua or something of the sort.[–]BlackBear443[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(1 child)But I have the side panel removed, wpidknt airflow no longer be a problem?[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(0 children)It likely won't offset the lose of the front fan.

Considering there's mo longer a function of thr intake fan. Is it bad?[–]cruisin5268dAlienware 17R5 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(0 children)You should never run your system with the side panel off unless you have liquid cooling for everything. It’s designed to suck air in the front and blow it across everything that needs passive cooking as well as provide sufficient air for the GPU fans AND enough airflow to exhaust the hot air out. So far you’ve asked about doing the two absolute worst things you could do in terms of airflow.    Just replace the fan if it’s noisy with a new quieter one.[–]SocialJusticeAndroidAurora R11 Intel 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(2 children)Why not just replace it with a quieter fan? Then you can reduce the fan noise and keep the airflow[–]BlackBear443[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(1 child)Can't find any tutorials on how to do it on the r7 model specifically, form the looks of it, it's impossible to replace it without doubg it forcibly[–]SocialJusticeAndroidAurora R11 Intel 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(0 children)Oh, that's weird. There's gotta be a way to do it though. I wonder if they still have a manual on the support site? You could also try Dell's Alienware forum.[–]Digs31789 0 points1 point2 points 6 days ago(0 children)Keep in mind the stock fans on these systems push significantly more air than Corsair or noctuas fans that you can typically buy. They have a much higher rpm setting so replacing them will decrease airflow overall and the max rpm will be about half of what you had before when using AWCC. Not saying don't replace the fan just letting you know WHY it's loud. It's a server fan.I have an extra Corsair ml 120 in my r10 and it is indeed quieter, but it does indeed push significantly less air just holding my hand in front of it\n",

I still use my Area51m R1 and it still destroys anything I throw at it @ 1080p.  The RTX2080 was pretty close to the desktop GPU's and the desktop CPU certainly held it's own.  My 9900k was a little below a desktop 9900k, but not by a ton, so I assume the 10900k would be about the same.  Cooling was much better, it's a larger chassis, but also with a desktop CPU, so it still got pretty toasty.Is it capable? Certainly, but as someone else pointed out it's a few years old now, so unless your getting it for a REALLY good price your probably better off looking at a newer model.  My M15R5 scores the same in Timespy that my Area51m does, at less then half the size and way lighter.  New 4xxx series laptops GPU's were announced today and look like they could possibly keep up with a desktop 3090, so let that sink in.  That being said you will pay a lot more probably, but the performance is definitely better.

The game I’m talking about is Mw2/Warzone 2 at 120fps max graphics. I also used the same cooling pad, the ietsgt500. The only pad I’ve seen have only positive reviews online, and it literally did nothing. Youtube videos have this thing aiding temps by 10-15 degrees. Granted, i didn’t check for cpu performance, just temps, but it was enough for me enough to return the cooling pad. After further research, I keep seeing conflicted reports that the cpu running at a constant 100c is by design because Alienware likes to give us as much performance as possible and it will be fine like that for long periods, but others say that only occasional spikes to 100c are safe, and it should hover at max 94-95c. After all this, I just limited cpu to 95 manually through bios.[–]namejeff849502 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago(0 children)I have the same laptop, and am stuck at 100C as well with a room fan and cooling pad supporting the laptop.Probably will end up sending it back for a refund, the heat problem is also second to the backlight bleed problem too.

In the bios, enable \"Performance fan mode\". That will max out the fans all the time and will help a little bit. If you are throttling like crazy, you need to call dell; my guess is bad paste application[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 -2 points-1 points0 points 8 days ago(6 children)Assuming that all of your bios, drivers, and software are fully up to date and working, I solved this issue (minimizing throttling) by the following steps:1) If you have a 3080TI nvidia dGPU, make sure the bios is updated to the June/July 2022 video bios, even if it is NOT officially recommended for your machine. This makes an ENORMOUS difference to the behavior and power characteristics of the dGPU. But, for some reason, Alienware/Dell is not shipping even new systems with this latest video bios enabled.2) \"Disable\" Advanced Optimus in the bios. It should use the iGPU less, which should reduce the heat/power usage of the CPU chip it shares. Note that this may be optional. I include it only for completeness.3) In AWCC, turn on the OVERCLOCK 2 profile. This officially undervolts things and helps tremendously with power draw vs. temp. It may be possible to push this further with a custom profile.4) In AWCC, use the PERFORMANCE thermal profile. This is the one correctly calibrated to keep you hitting 100 degrees C the least frequently while maximizing the system's ratio and performance. Full Speed will throttle you and actually hurt game performance and benchmarks.Use Task Manager or whatever monitoring tool that you want to keep the GPU use in a game from pegging at 100%, etc. You can adjust quality settings, etc. to get better and more consistent frame rates, minimize throttling, etc.I hope that helps. Let us know if it does or doesn't, please (to help others in the same boat). Good luck!   :)[–]DataGOGO 3 points4 points5 points 8 days ago(3 children)Nothing in this post is correct and is terrible advice.[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago(2 children)Prove it.

This officially undervolts things and helps tremendously with power draw vs. temp. It may be possible to push this further with a custom profile.What? Overclocking will Increase voltage, not decrease it....if you overclock your CPU and undervolt it all at the same time, your going to have a very bad time.  This will make the machine run hotter, not cool it down...[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 -1 points0 points1 point 8 days ago(0 children)No. The OC2 profile UNDERVOLTS the CPU, so that when it gets pushed to max (normally) it isn't drawing as much power. That profile doesn't \"overclock\" the CPU of GPU at all.[–]RogueAsgard 2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago(0 children)Normal. Use high performance mode for your fans and make sure you are using dGPU. You will get great performance as well as full TPU.[–]s1rrahArea51m R1  2 points3 points4 points 8 days ago(2 children)It doesn't have to be \"normal,\" per se; you can follow the suggestions of others and use various means to limit the power sent to the 12700H.  Try downloading Throttlestop and using it to adjust your PL1 and PL2 power settings.  Throttlestop won't let you modify your voltages or clock speeds but you can sort of \"hack\" the same thing by using PL1 and PL2 to limit the power levels and thereby limiting your processor speed.  I think.  ;-)Point is.  You don't need to run your CPU at it's max speed (power) for good gaming.  My Area51mR2 laptop (unlocked 10700K) will game with the exact same FPS at 4.0ghz as it will at 5.0ghz (~2C delta here and there) but at 5.0ghz, the laptop CPU peaks at 90C whereas when switching to the lower clock speed of 4.0ghz, the peak temps drop to around 65C.  No brainer.Since your 12700H is locked, then you must find some way to limit power.  You can also experiment with custom Windows Power plans. Best of luck[–]Ntirely[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago(1 child)Thanks[–]s1rrahArea51m R1  0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago(0 children)mucho gusto[–]DataGOGO 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago(11 children)Normal. you can undervolt to reduce temps/ increase performance, but you need to be on bios 1.8 or lower.[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 -1 points0 points1 point 8 days ago(10 children)No, you can undervolt in 1.9.1 or later if you use the OC profiles in AWCC to do it.[–]DataGOGO 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago(9 children)Awcc profiles don’t undervolt (or undervolt everything you need to undervolt) nor do they make use of TVB. Awcc is absolute dog shit[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 -1 points0 points1 point 8 days ago(8 children)They undervolt enough to solve the problem the OP was actually asking about. But you don't actually care about helping him, do you? You're just here to e-peen your own overclock settings...[–]DataGOGO 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*(7 children)No they don't. The AWCC profiles are still limited to undervolt protection in 1.9.1 and later. This is an Intel limitation set in the UEFI, thus even AWCC can never reduce voltage below boot voltage (which is no-where near enough). Which is why the AWCC undervolt profile before 1.9.1 was better than post 1.9.1. In addition, the best feature in all 12th and 13th gen intel CPU's is TVB; and awcc keeps TVB disabled out of pure laziness.   See for yourself, Take your X17 R2 with 1.9.1 or later bios, set AWCC profile 2, and run CB R23, and post your results. I will bet dollar to donuts you are thermal throttled immediately. If you have proper undervolting, and more importantly TVB, you wouldn't throttle. OP was reporting \"thermal throttling all over the place\", even in games, which shouldn't happen, even completely stock, as most games are not at all CPU intensive, and even with a 3080ti, it is limited to a continuous 155w before it down clocks the NVRAM by 1000mhz.OP has a cooling issue. Changing settings, running AWCC (which is dogshit and has a lot of overhead all on it's own), and attempting to tune around the fact that his cooling system is not performing as expected will not help him. He either needs to re-mount and re-paste the cooler or contact support and get them to do it.As a temp work around, he can set his fan performance mode to enabled in the bios, that might help a bit.[–]Ritual_Homicide 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago(2 children)The 102 you are hitting indicates a thermal paste or cooler issue.

If it's dropping boost clocks then you have a problem.  What are the CPU clocks doing when it's throttling? Are they dropping back to stock CPU clock speeds? If so then no, that's not normal.  If it's hitting 100c and maintaining boost then that's normal.[–]lilrabbitfoofooX17R2 -2 points-1 points0 points 8 days ago(0 children)My post already addressed this.

I’ll warn you. Adding thermal paste will void your warranty for “opening it up” but it will run a heck lot cooler.  I would reach out to dell to see if they can either approve adding thermal paste or bring it right into a Dell store.  Get them to do it there.[–]Brave-Advertising169 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(0 children)Its wild that Alienware can sell these systems no problem, when they can’t run anything without throttling.

Thank you guys so much for the replies!So I tried all these solutions. First uninstalled all graphics drivers using DDU, even the Intel graphics was gone, then installed them with Intel ChipsetINF and GeForce Experience (it sucks btw), also tried to mod the RegEdit to 600 using link above. The results are the same: the external display connected to AGA works ONLY A FEW SECONDS, and then freezes at the moment it freezes, until the laptop restarts or the external display cable physically disconnected from the AGA. The 3080 FE and 3070 Laptop GPU were both showing up in device management, AWCC and Task manager BEFORE the DP or HDMI cable is connected to AGA. And it won’t freeze if the external display is disconnected from AGA (when the AGA is still connected to laptop).Now I’m thinking the possibility of 3080 FE being defected, or just the stock Dell 450w PSU inside AGA is not powerful enough for 3080 FE? I just ordered a Corsair SF750 hoping that it could solve this shit, if it’s a PSU issue.

(but usb ports on aga works no matter how.) i don't have a desktop computer to test whether there's something wrong with the 3080 graphic card or the aga /cable. they were bought individually from different ebay sellers. or is it just the laptop from year 2021 doesn't support aga anymore? (then why does it still have aga port?) (i did some research but only could find some posts regarding older alienware laptop models, not m15 r*) can someone help me out please? thank you in advance!\n",

Any recommendations on the m2 SSD if so?[–]thinkofitnow 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago*(1 child)Yep, exactly, (a new pcie m.2 nvme SSD) - you might want to consider a 2TB, tbh. My Aurora R8 has actually been rocking a Dell branded m2. However, when you view it through the 'device mangler' it's listed as being from Toshiba. So, I believe for sure that Toshiba is supplying Dell's m.2 nvme SSD drives. Here you can see the Dell branded drive (2TB) shows Toshiba. I also have a Samsung SSD, but it's not an m.2 nvme. The 'problem' with the Aurora R8 motherboards when they came out is that you can only use a single m.2 slot for a possible boot drive. The other slot is specifically for something else (I can't remember).<image>Here is what I believe I purchased back then when I first got my Aurora R8 https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-m2-pcie-nvme-gen-3x4-class-40-2280-solid-state-drive-2tb/apd/ab400209/storage-drives-media:I'm not sure if you live in the USA, but if you do, you have some decent choices. I think back at the time I purchased mine, I did so from Dell, since I was using it with an Alienware, and warranty, etc. so that in case things didn't turn out right, they couldn't deny my support for using it on their 'unsupported' list. Here are some other choices, if you do purchase it from Dell https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/pcie-ssd-drives/ar/8374[–]gotslided[S] 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago(0 children)Thank you, sir, you have been of great help. What's so bizarre about this computer to me is that at times my windows runs slower compared to any of my games and it will tend to freeze. I really want to just get a fast SSD and shove my windows on there.[–]Loud-Job7030AREA 51 R2 | M15 R2 | AW610M | AW558 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago*(0 children)PSU is good, my area 51 r2 has a 1500 watt psu, but it never goes beyond 600 watts, and i have a 5960x (140w) and a rtx 3070 (220w). First thing you would need is buy a 1tb generic x10 speed kingston SSD for around 65$. Next is the RAM, sell the 2x8 and get 2x16 hyperx fury for a good boost. Next i would suggest to upgrade the GPU, all things considered the 1080 is still powerful, even by todays standards, but a 3070Ti or a 3080 would yeild a nice 30-70% boost considering DLSS and RT. Lastly you could go a for a cpu upgrade, the good thing about ur desktop, is that ur socket can handle a core i9 9900k which draws around 95 watts, it should be enough for ur psu. (cpu lets you achieve higher fps) (gpu lets your game look better while achieving those high fps) Just beware that a 3080 draws 320watts, which might be too much for ur psu if you ended up going for a 9900k, a 3070 draws 220 watts, which your psu should suffice.\n",

You'll need some longer bolts to get it to all fit, but people have said they've fitted the extra fan in just fine.Then use your new ML120 Pro (which as long as it's a 'Pro' fan and spins to 2400RPM or faster, won't cause a BIOS error), as your new front intake fan. That way your radiator has a matching pair to overcome the resistance of the radiator, and the front intake is your new Corsair, which should feed the air in nicely anyway.[–]zx12045c 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(6 children)Didn't get rid of the error message for me.

It's a power-on self-test routine designed to prevent the system from running with a failed cooling system and suffering longer-term damage.

Let it download any components it needs.

      "content:  so my awcc (x17) stopped working day before last and would not open whatsoever. i attempted to update what i could but that only seemed to have created more issues. i uninstalled the program and attempted to redownload it from both the dell drivers support page as well as through microsoft store through the link in the myalienware app, each time uninstalling and restarting before attempting each method. nothing helped. when i install it sometimes it won't even open and then sometimes it will begin to load and ask if awcc can make changes to my system and i accept yes and then from then on it only sits a the white alien loading screen and then crashes. ​ so, i googled the issue and attempted a complete reinstall of the system. reinstalled windows and carefully updated windows drivers, bios, and worked my way down the list of all the critical drivers to be updated through the dell support. however, i cannot even get the os system assist to install as of now. ​ i have carried this out 4 times now as i felt maybe i did something wrong along the way (i am not computer savvy unfortunately) yet i still run into the same issue of installing awcc and the white loading screen. ​ so my other option on install #4 was to use an older version of awcc to which the issue continued. ​ the big reason i am adamant on having the control center is because i am using a x17 laptop and want to be able to control the fans as i do not want my laptop to over heat. currently i have it on a cooling pad with fans underneath ( i have seen many recommend the device so i purchased from amazon) and i have it angled for more airflow as well. i attempted installs of msi afterburner as i read you can control your fans with that, but the options were greyed out, as well as checked through the corsair icue but they didn't allow it either. ​ is there something i am missing on the install or other options available to fix this issue. i've read many people just carried out a revo uninstall and reinstall (which i did) and it worked for them but i haven't been so lucky. thank you in advance for any information or recommendations! ​ happy new year!!\n",

Then shut down and add one new chip.  It might be able to add the chip to the BIOS definitions.  If it barfs at this point, the new memory is not usable but if it starts, then shut down, pull the coin battery and unplug.  Hold the power on button to reset the ROM, pull old memory and install second new memory stick in matching colored memory stick holder.  Plug back in and power up.  It may stall out but force restart up to 3 times.   It should catch and run normally.  Keep your old memory sticks safe with you incase a future BIOS update causes grief and you have to re-install.  Good luck![–]robloxians[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(0 children)I don’t think this would work because the new ram is running at different speeds than the old one.

I have had no drops appear anywhere yet, and my machine gets some serious usage.Most waterblocks have leak detection systems that will alert the user via flashing the RGBS red. While these can give false positives, that is better than false negatives.The best way to eliminate leaks is to minimize parts and tight bends soft hoses while plumbing- same as you would with any plumbing configuration (or any design in general)- the fewest moving parts to achieve the targeted performance.[–]martycochrane[S] 6 points7 points8 points 10 days ago(0 children)Found some replacement fans online but will take a while to arrive.

Best example would be when GTA crashes, I just click “Launch” again, and the game launches as normal. The game or computer don’t recognize a loss of connection, or an error that is displayed. The program is not minimizing, as I have to start the game that closed via the launchers again. Task manager shows that they aren’t still running.

GTA, which has been having this issue the most, is running off of Epic Games launcher as well as the Rockstar Launcher. However, the reason i’m thinking it isn’t one of the launchers is this also happened twice while playing Forza Horizon 5 through the pre-installed Xbox application, which really threw me off, as I initially also thought it was an issue with Rockstar or Epic Games[–]Adilrizwan38[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(3 children)The Specs are as followed:Additionally, everything except Google Chrome is installed on a Samsung 870 EVO 2TB 2.5 Inch SATA.

I've owned 5 alienware laptops and the biggest problem I had was on the first one where the cd drive worked intermittently. It was fixed within a day by a guy they sent to my apartment. And my laptops do NOT lead an easy life.  15+ days a month on the road living off a laptop, multiple flights every day, etc.  I keep buying them because they're durable and well put together.  (And if something is wrong, the service is excellent)[–]Yauchout 8 points9 points10 points 10 days ago(0 children)I understand what you're saying. I'm on my third alienware laptop. Mine don't live a easy life either. often when I see user damage issues on these things, I wonder what they really doing to them considering mine spends 10 to 15 days a week on the road in the vibration of a heavy truck. The last one was 6 years old before I replaced it with the current one. Maybe I won't be lucky with the current one, but we will see[–]AlbrechtSchoenheiserArea51m R2  3 points4 points5 points 10 days ago(0 children)That has been my experience as well. They replaced a graphics card during lockdowns in my garage and they have been bugging me to come to my house and replace my LCD screen but I keep having to tell them to chill out wait till the holidays are over. Then again, I have the 5-year premium support warranty.[–]zdevilinside -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago(0 children)Since March, I have had 4 different Alienware laptops fail - out of 4.m17 r3 - failed mb, replaced with x17 r1 under warrantyx17 r1 - multiple failed MBs, screens, something like 7 or 8 attempted repairs in 3 months.  returned for refundm17 r5 - failed MB, returned within 30 days.  Tech support continued to contact us after we returned the system asking us to try other troubleshooting things.  They even asked us if we shipped the system back which means that they didn't look at their own systems/tracking.  x17 r2 - the system I bought to replace x17 r1.  Failed MB, failed screen, failed battery, and it is still not fixed.  Been offered an exchange.What is bad is that I am on my sabbatical from a US Government job.  I have had to make 4 separate trips back to the US at my own expense to get these things \"fixed\" else I get a huge cut in equipment - i7 instead of a i9, 3070ti instead of 3080 ti, 1080p instead of 4k screen, 1TB instead of 4tb, and the list goes on.At work, we have noticed that the number of systems requiring hardware repair over the last few years has almost doubled during its time under warranty.  HP has actually been about the same - .2% fluctuation while Dell's has gone up 1.7%.  Not good in the least.  Oh, and that is over about 20k Dell systems, laptops, workstations and servers.When I return from my sabbatical next month, I am going to go along with many others on the Change Control Board, and the Product Advisory Council where there has been a push to drop our dependence on Dell equipment and start buying more HP.  We have JIT contracts with both so it isn't that hard to change.  Do you think Dell will get their act together if they start losing $50m+ in sales a year because of their lack of quality control, logistics, and other supply chain issues?The most common reason behind Dell's issues has been \"China and COVID\" but I don't believe it anymore.  Why?  HP has just as much reliance and hasn't had as much difficulty as Dell.[–]darth_magnum45 5 points6 points7 points 10 days ago(6 children)Probably happened during shipping.

I fix MacBook/Phone and Tablet so it shouldn’t be a problem for me to replace it . But what a frustrating situation. Never took this laptop outside , always been extremely careful with it and it broke on his own . 1st and last Alienware for me[–]darth_magnum45 6 points7 points8 points 10 days ago(0 children)Dude that’s really over exaggerating the issue. Nothing is break proof. Frankly if you see no damage you might be able to get them to fix it depending on if your warranty is still there.[–]cornezy 14 points15 points16 points 10 days ago(2 children)So no more insight,  no nothing?

I don’t know that I would swear them off entirely, but I’m definitely making a much more informed decision befor buying again.P.S. have had good experiences with ROG and Legion laptops. Got the Lenovo Legion 5 recently for my wife and it’s very nice. Zero issues with it and I secretly wish it was mine. Boo hoo[–]Spooky1937 2 points3 points4 points 10 days ago(0 children)I personally won't purchase another Alienware desktop due to thermal issues from the case design itself. But their peripherals and monitors are usually great. Next pc I will build myself and use Alienware monitors and peripherals only.[–]sId-Sapnu-puas 2 points3 points4 points 10 days ago(1 child)Can happen to any laptop of any brand tho. Sometimes you just get a lemon. I owned 2 ASUS laptops which had to be returned within 2 weeks of ownership due to faults. I couldn’t be bothered to deal with ASUS support so it was easier to get my money back and I eventually bought an Area51m because it offered more power at the same price. I was prepared to return the Area 51m immediately should it arrive faulty but it worked fine and has served me well the last 3 years.[–]Fearless-Two-7100[S] 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago(0 children)Probably unlucky[–]DataGOGO 2 points3 points4 points 10 days ago(1 child)Go buy an MSI, Asus or any other brand. When something goes wrong let me know how long it takes them to send a repair tech to your house and repair it.... Oh yeah, They won't, you have to put in a box, pay for shipping to return center, wait 6-8 weeks and hope they fix it. Parts go bad, and a certain percentage of parts will die withing the first 6 months of operation. That has nothing to do with Dell, that is just all electronics.[–]sId-Sapnu-puas 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)Yeah the Taiwanese brands are awful with customer support. When my ASUS products had issues early into ownership I returned it immediately to the seller and got my money back. Far easier than dealing with ASUS directly.[–]dburly 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago(0 children)I’ve had my Alienware 15 R3 since 2016 and it’s still going fine. I’ve replaced the touchpad about a year ago and I’ve had no complaints. Some people just have bad luck. Every company makes a few bad ones every now and then.[–]aka619ASH9 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago(0 children)To be honest. I had very good experience with Dell, be kind and be polite. I bought Area 51M laptop, remember tht modular laptop and it is still rocking with lot of upgrades. But when I first got it, there was a minor chip on the plastic near web cam. I requested for a new laptop and it came in a week, as I paid 5grand +, so I expect a clean cut piece from the box.Yeah, sometimes it can be bad luck. Like I had getting deadpixels with Samsung crg9 monitor. So if you are under warranty, talk to customer suppport, explain it to them and I am sure they will help you out.[–]mocha-only 3 points4 points5 points 10 days ago(0 children)Sir.

They really are fantastic in the majority of cases, and rather than give up on a brand completely, give them a chance to fix it your you.Rebooting randomly is usually a software problem - not something caused by Alienware, but more likely a bad Windows update, a bad app installed, or just a combination of apps and updates that don't play nice. Could happen to anyone with any brand of PC.[–]Fearless-Two-7100[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 10 days ago(3 children)The issue for the rebooting issue was the Dell support app , can you believe it ?

I won't be buying Asus again and will pick up an Alienware next time. Its almost like each of our single experiences with a brand aren't representative of the quality of their products.

It's only a few months old. And Asus is not doing much to help him. Anecdotal issues are just that, anecdotal.[–]DataGOGO 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago(2 children)This is physical damage.

It was impacted in some way and it broke. guessing towards lower right-hand corner.[–]Fearless-Two-7100[S] -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago(0 children)How can it be a physical damage with a laptop closed with nobody at home. I know already that alienware will use the same excuse . Most likely it’s a manufactured issue because I never take out my laptop from home and i never changed the position of it.[–]darth_magnum45 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)That’s not necessarily true as it could be a defect that kicked in or something. Without signs of physical damage it’s a defect issue and should be covered by warranty.[–]RowPuzzled2354 -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago(0 children)Rare variant[–]thewecken -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago(0 children)It has not been 1year and the charger is not working.

My screen was repaired on my m11x 3 times before they sent a “senior” tech to do the repair. 3 months out of warranty the screen went out again. My desktop was purchased on 11-2-22 I received it 11-28-22 spoke with Dell tech support on 12-2, 12-4, 12-8 and then on 12-20 they offered to repair my motherboard. I declined and said I wanted a new pc. It’s currently “in production”. I wish I would have bought an Omen heard nothing but good things but at 900 a 6600 xt and a Ryzan 7 sounded like a good deal.

Especially since you mentioned you're in Oz. I'm in Melbourne and my house cooler crapped out a few days ago and 2 days ago it was like 37 degrees in the house. I went out to try beat the heat and I came back to find out that one of my 3d printers had crapped its control board mid print. That was definitely due to the heat and humidity. Maybe your laptop was running while closed and the heat caused a hardware failure? I've had my 13 R3 for years now and the hinge sleep switch is the only issue it's ever had so maybe yours was similar? Either way, hope you get it sorted mate[–]Fearless-Two-7100[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(1 child)It’s not that humide or hot right now in Sydney mate , so maybe it can be caused by humidity. Also , my wife got a MSI and use it everyday and not any issue similar to mine. I contacted the customer support and hopefully they will fix it under warranty . \n",

Loud unit so get used to it -- you may be comfortable playing with headphones but everyone around you will think you have a mini-vacuum turned on as the fans get LOUD even on light gaming. The laptop has very small fans, 4 of them so at Low-moderate RPM, they are very audible. 12th gen Intel is just not very cool running to begin with so spikes to 90-100c is going to freak you out but  so far ALL of the laptops with 12th gen run the same temps.  CPU - 80-100c gaming.  GPU - 70-90c gaming.  Paid 5k / 3.7k USD for mine. So you got a great deal after the usual Lysol treatment.[–]Thick-Detail-8198 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(0 children)Good deal definitely. But i would make sure that the machine has no ‘hidden’ problems, given you were able to get it in that descent price. These models are fairly new in the market and I would not think of any reason/s for someone to sell these in low price unless they really want to get rid of it at any given price they might take.Congrats though! I hope you love it!\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)I have an Alienware m17 R4 which originally had a 17.3 inch 1080p 144hz screen. I bought this screen from ebay. https://www.ebay.com/itm/394040093093?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=utzqkwgjtq6&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=MJljWzLWQsW&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPYI removed my old screen which is basically glued in btw. So use a bit of heat and be careful but to be honest you will likely damage your screen a bit taking it out. Afterwards you can just place the screen in with out putting the backing strips on and the bezel will hold your new screen in place. Mine was a 40 pin connection and yours may be as well. So my laptop has advanced optimus which means it has a mux switch. The screen was never officially supported by alienware on the m17 r4. It works just fine. I think the igpu can't support 165hz at 2560x1440 as it remains at 60hz but when i press fn+f7 and switch to discrete gpu mode then the screen works at 165hz. Only \"bad\" part is the screen i linked doesn't have gsync. So long answer short. Yes you can replace your screen. Yes you can upgrade it. It does not have official support and never will. Dell doesn't sell upgrades and won't change your order to accommodate a different screen even if they were to sell it to you which they won't. Dell has long abandoned the path of upgrades and repairability.\n",

Otherwise your VRMs will overheat as they no longer have direct airflow.Beyond that, you'll want to use fans capable of at least 2400RPM, so that they don't trigger the BIOS errors on boot. Any 120mm fans that reach 2400RPM will be fine, though.[–]DaBomba_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(4 children)The Corsair H60 have 2400 RPM as their max rotational speed, so I think I am fine there.

It’s technically a B550A board.I absolutely think it was worth it, yes.  After fiddling with fan curves to stop it sounding like it’ll take the fuck off, nothing ever exceeds 85 degrees now, and my idle temps are late thirties across the board.It is a complete pain in the dick.  You will have to accept BIOS errors (which means you’ll need a wired keyboard).  You’ll have to buy PSU cable extensions.  You’ll have to do a push-pull with some meaty fans for the AIO, or otherwise luck out with a cooler that’s compatible.  You’ll also have to either live without or cut a custom I/O shield because that’s part of the case on the R10.Having said it’s a complete pain in the dick, it’s much less of a pain in the dick than the R10’s case and chassis.  I’ve lusted after Alienware since a decade before they were Dell and even I feel like they made the conscious, malicious decision to use the case they did.[–]Mossberg500_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(2 children)I agree with you on the small stuff. It was my biggest drawback on this pc but I got such a good deal I couldn’t pass it up. Is it possible to just buy a new PSU just for the longer cables?

It’s resting on the backplate with a metric fuckton of thermal paste essentially being used as glue.  This has brought temps down a good 8 degrees in this case, which is down a total of about 30 degrees cooler than the bone-stock 115 degrees I was getting in the R10 case!It appears to be inconclusive whether the stock PSU has an atypical pin-out for the main ATX connector, or whether the mobo has an atypical pin-in.  Long and short of it, I’d only use extension cables rather than replacing the entire supply unless you’re swapping out the mobo too.  To be completely fair, the R10 PSUs appear to be from dell’s server division so they’re actually pretty good options.In terms of upgrades, the Corsair 5000X case I’ve got set me back about £125 and has space for a full ATX board, dual 4090s and a second power supply with room to spare.  I’m not that mental/rich unfortunately, but if you have the room for it, I’d put my stamp of approval on it, whatever that’s worth.\n",

No such thing as a legitimate 10 euro key unless you qualify for a particular Microsoft discount, and that’s sold to the individual not through a company.[–]PookiasX17R2 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago(0 children)I’m a little confused with your component selection — you’re pairing a 5900X with a 6600 XT? Unless you’re really in need of a 12-core CPU, I would strongly consider allocating more of your budget to your GPU obviously if the main use is gaming. You could easily do a 5600X or 5700X and massively increase performance pairing it with a 6750 XT or 6800 XT at that price. As for which you should do — unless you’re seriously uncomfortable or have zero desire at all to learn how to build a computer, or if you really just want that Alienware design, I would 100% build your own. You’re getting off the shelf components that can be re-used and easily repaired/replaced, higher quality base components (especially RAM, motherboard, case), and the pride of looking at your system and knowing you built it yourself. This is an Alienware subreddit - a lot of folks here are in the camp that they’re fans of the brand or they simply didn’t want to build their own, so there will be some bias here. But I’d definitely lean towards building your own — just try to better match your CPU/GPU together.[–]Sweaty-Barber1971 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago(19 children)If you go Alienware you will get a real warranty and also sometimes some performance mode goodies[–]ARimworlder[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(17 children)You get warranty with every one of those parts which is in every case longer than 1 year[–]Sweaty-Barber1971 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(16 children)Yes but warranty does not cover accidental from installation[–]ARimworlder[S] -1 points0 points1 point 10 days ago(7 children)As long as you follow the manuals/video guides its unlikely that you will accidentally damage something during installation.[–]Sweaty-Barber1971 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(6 children)Ok, just another thing, dell does offer free technical support and also a option to extend the warranty after purchasing the system[–]cruisin5268dAlienware 17R5 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(7 children)I personally do not know anyone’s that has ever needed accidental damage coverage on a desktop computer.

The value in prebuilts isn’t in the components, it’s in the time involved in building. In my particular situation, I choose an Alienware because it’s a reliable brand I knew and so I could plug in and get right down to using it the moment it came in. If You have the time and know how of course your going to save money building your own. If not buy a good Alienware and just get to gaming.[–]nickierv 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)I have seen the time involved argument but that relies on 2 things: 1, the parts are sensible. So no i9+GT1030 for a gaming system. 2, the actual time to build. If your really lucky you might find someone who will build you a system for $20, but most places will be asking $100+. Figure 3 hours if you have never built before, 20-30 minutes if you have. Then also account for things shaking loose in shipping. It can happen to anyone and is more common that most think. If you built it, you know what to look for. If not, are you going to spend 2 hours on the phone chasing around \"check to make sure the GPU/RAM/storage is plugged in\"[–]ARimworlder[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)Small error i only spotted now: the equivalent list has 32gb of ram not  16 but it is only a £30 difference or so and further cements my point.  This also assumes that you are getting a cheap windows key[–]cruisin5268dAlienware 17R5 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(4 children)If you’re comparing costs then you need to compare costs…Windows license, internal cables, fans, so on.  People tend to leave these out of their comparisons.  Personally I don’t think it’s wise to make a decision based on price because you’re comparing two very different computers and experiences. There’s also some key advantages of a prebuilt such as a single point of contact for warranty issues - and not just that you’re covered but you actually have support. On top of that you’re getting hardware that’s been tested for compatibility as well as driver and software support which is extremely minimal for individual components.[–]ARimworlder[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(3 children)A Windows 10 Key (No e cores so no point in 11), i have no idea what you mean by internal cables and the G360A comes with 3 fans. I can understand the point about warranty but I don't understand the point about compatibility as PCPartpicker and basic knowledge of you rcomponents will show if anything is incompatible and you can just get drivers from the AMD/NVIDIA website or windows.[–]cruisin5268dAlienware 17R5 -2 points-1 points0 points 10 days ago(2 children)Lol pcpartspicker is not the same as a team of engineers designing an entire system and then doing thorough testing on all the components as well as designing software to ensure everything works together all nice and happy.Regardless if it’s Win 10/11 you’ll need to buy a license (or key as you said) either way.[–]nickierv 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago(0 children)You don't need a team of engineers to design a system. Also, if a team of engineers designed the AW i9 systems, I would be double checking qualifications.[–]perfes -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago(0 children)Lol you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Yes you need a windows keys but you don’t need to fab ur own internal cables for a pc. The Alienware also probably has lower quality parts in it since they use their oem parts for higher profits. Main reason people buy prebuilt is so they don’t have to build it themselves.[–]devkets[🍰] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)So it’s a £500 difference. I see two main differences going with the Alienware:These two reasons are, IMO, the two biggest factors people end up buying from a pre-built company. We can always save money by following DIY methods in any hobby… so while I do find it interesting to see the price difference when having matched components, I don’t really see the point to defending the build-your-own model as much as you have in this thread. But those are my thoughts.[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)Building your own has always, with the exception of pandemic fuckery, been cheaper, your not really informing anyone in this sub of that.  We're not here because we think we got a better deal cost wise then building our own.  A lot of people are here because they A) Like the design B) Can't be bothered to build their own C) Don't know how to build their own and don't want to learn.[–]Relentless_Recluse95 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)Probably won’t add much to what’s already been said… But I will say I ordered the R14 Ryzen edition from Amazon & I love it.

I did some mild fan replacements and reapplied the thermal paste, and it has worked great! I didn't have to use the warranty at all, but I have used tech support 4 or 5 times, and they have been very helpful and have no extra charges for it. The only downfall to the Aurora PCs is the upgradeability, in my opinion.\n",

Usually it interferes with keyboard itself.  In fact it did when it failed an update recently on my m17R2.  I had to reload windows and all apps from scratch and wipe drive to get my keyboard and command center working again.  It also was dead upon initial reinstall but after removing the drivers rebooting by pulling battery wires (would not reboot any other way) it finally all got back into working normal state.  Wasn't easy but I did get it all back to working better than new condition.  I love my number pad and no current alienware laptops have it anymore sadly so am gonna keep my laptop going as long as I can.[–]T-Trollm15 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago(4 children)Use \"Go dark\" at AWCC to turn off the lights, or \"Go dim\" to decrease brightness. Also, you can press Fn+AlienFX to do so.You can just modify light's color to something less bright as well.[–]iiDark_Roses[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(2 children)But the problem thats causing me to not turn off the lights is that the AWCC doesn't work.[–]T-Trollm15 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago(1 child)AWCC UI or AWCCService?

This is because you can purchase a M15 R7 that comes with warranty for $1400.00 That extra $400 bucks is worth it for current or last gen internals and the knowledge of a new product. So you need to make your laptop considerably cheaper.

Seriously though you can get a laptop thats better than that brand new for under $1000. You’re asking too much. Go look up your laptop on eBay and filter completed and sold listings or star to list it and eBay will tell you the average selling price and you’ll see what it’s worth which should be much less than you’re asking.It looks like $600-700 from my quick glance. $300-$400 for parts only (not working)[–]Zentrosis 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)As others have said, 1000 is very high.

Was wondering if repast makes sense.[–]xLeeS[S] 2 points3 points4 points 11 days ago*(0 children)The overall performance gain isn't that big apparently, but there was a significant improvement on the CPU. The GPU already had a good application of the thermal interface. Only the Element 31 was underperforming.It is a big risk due to loss of warranty and the possibility of liquid metal leaking, so I would not recommend it for people who don't know how to disassemble and clean liquid metal correctly. The gain in performance ends up not being that much.[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 1 point2 points3 points 11 days ago(0 children)Nice, good pics and comparisons.  From what I can see you actually only gained a few degrees.  From what I have read online Kryonaut extreme does have a burn in period though, so the temps may improve over time.  Seems like the Element 31 wasn't doing that bad overall really, which is good to see.

However, I did see that for normal use, some people reported that there was a deterioration in performance after 3 months of use.I will be monitoring the temperature after a few months.[–]soulee06 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(1 child)The issue isn’t that Element 31 sucks. The issue is that Dell applies any thermal paste like a bunch of monkeys. I would love to re-paste also, but not sure the procedure to remove the element 31, if special chemical is needed etc.\n",
      "model:  alienware m15 r7\n",
      "content:  i recently bought an alienware m15 r7 and as an enthusiast i like to get the best out of the machine possible. it had been a long time since i had a notebook, and i researched a lot until i decided to get this model. when i was researching the model, i saw the \"element 31\" specification, which encouraged me in the purchase since i know how efficient liquid metal is in heat exchange, which i have seen in several cpu delid's and in the video cards that i've had over the years. however, when using it i could see that in reality this \"element 31\" was not what i imagined for liquid metal performance. so i decided to remove the lm and replace it with a high-performance kryonaut extreme thermal paste. at first, i really wanted to apply conductonaut, but i ended up giving up as it would be much more work and maybe the gain wouldn't be worth it. it was difficult for me to do this procedure, because on the internet there was nothing about changing the thermal interface of the m15 r7, so i was guided by the videos of the r6 and i managed. there are very few differences between the two in the matter of disassembly, the big difference is in the part of the element 31 where it has a \"cpu barrier\" to not leak liquid metal to other components. unfortunately, i didn't take pictures of the process, i was so focused that i completely forgot about it. but, the real big difference is about removing element 31. it is quite dense like a silicon, but when you pass something (in my case, a cotton swab) it starts to really look like liquid metal. the hardest part was really removing the lm correctly to avoid leaks, even more so when dealing with a notebook. now, for what really matters: https://imgur.com/a/rld5eqn. - the test was done with a benchmark in 3d mark time spy, which can be checked at the link. hardware stats by hwinfo. ambient temperature of 17 °c / 62.6 °f with a/c in both tests. it is important to note that the notebook was not in stock, i set the tcc offset of the i7 12700h to 10. i also had undervolted the gpu via msi afterburner curve, where i left it at 1545mhz at 700mv. gpu below 65c can stay at 1530mhz. memory clock with +1700mhz. from the alienware command center: overclock: n/a (off) thermal: balanced power: balanced my final thoughts. it is worth it? with the result prints, it can be seen that now the cpu can work with a higher voltage and higher consumption, even with thermal throttling (with tcc level 10), consecutively gaining more points in the benchmark. the average temperature of cpu was 87°c with element 31 and 78°c with thermal grizzly kryonaut extreme. average frequency went from 3.495mhz to 3.913mhz. the gpu made no difference at all. there was no element 31 in it. now it warms up a degree less. i'm also noticing that the fans are making less noise and even in the benchmark they took longer to start spinning. for those who want an improvement in noise, it might be worth it. ----------------------------------- i hope this post helps anyone who has this question about changing the thermal interface of this notebook. maybe, if i had done the test with everything in stock, there would have been a more significant gain, but it's the configuration i've been using since i bought it. however, if you're going to do this procedure, remember that working with liquid metal is not easy, and if you haven't done it before, you could end up damaging your device permanently. be careful.\n",

You'll also likely find that if you ever need to contact Support about anything GPU related, they're going to ask you to install the latest full driver package anyway, rather than your cut-down version.[–]Mindless_Foot_1338Area-51 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(2 children)DO NOT DO THIS IS WILL BRICK YOUR LAPTOP.

I could understand if you’re building a purouse-built computer that will only ever do one task, and only needs certain components of device drivers. But that’s not the case here I would assume? Are you lacking in ram, or storage? In that case there are better and more permanent solutions to those issues.[–]cns000Alienware 17R5[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago*(1 child)my laptop has a gtx 1080 graphics card. it is an old graphics card. these days nvidia drivers have features that improve the performance of new graphics cards. unfortunately, all of those features are not used by old graphics cards so there is a performance penalty so the performance can get worse on new drivers. that's why i want to debloat the driver to remove all the unneeded features[–]Maggaen95 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)Checking reviews of NVcleaninstall, hardly any mention performance differences, and those that do does not show any consistent or significant differences. This makes sense though, NVcleaninstall doesn't let you say rewrite DX11 logic, it just lets you remove features you may not need, that would not be in use anyway if not used.  Don't get me wrong, do what you want, but it seems to me thatt you have a severe misunderstanding of the benefits this will give you.\n",

      "content:  i want to install nvidia driver version 527.56 on my alienware 17 r5 i9 laptop by using nvcleanstall to debloat the driver. i have never debloated the driver before so i want to make sure i am doing it correctly. i will use these options https://i.imgur.com/sdevy7c.jpg some nvidia graphics cards have usb c ports so they need the usb c driver of the nvidia driver. my graphics card is a chip and it doesn't have a usb c port so no need to tick usb c driver of the nvidia driver and not ticking it won't mess up the usb c port of my laptop also the last time i installed the nvidia driver i installed it normally so it installed the nvidia usb-c driver. i will clean install the nvidia driver so that will remove the nvidia usb-c driver. if i don't instead the nvidia usb-c driver then the usb-c port of the laptop will continue to work ok because it uses a different usb-c driver also i am connecting the tv to the hdmi port of the laptop and it will still work with the options that i selected is what i said correct?\n",

Put the machine in performance mode and try again.  Gaming laptops will hit 100c nowadays, it's just the way it is.  100c is no longer danger territory, despite what some people think, it's a matter of can the laptop hold it's clock speeds when it does it.  If it's throttling hard AND hitting 100c then you have a problem, but if it's getting to 100c and holding the clock speeds then it's operating exactly as intended.  You can use TCC offset in the BIOS, set it to 10, that will limit the CPU temps to 90c and you will likely see very little difference in performance.[–]alafcagri[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)Thanks 🙏🏻[–]DataGOGO 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(1 child)Normal behavior for a laptop running a synthetic workload like Cinebench[–]alafcagri[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)Thanks mate\n",

      "content of comments: (6 children)If you believe your experience is an accurate representation of general experience then fair enough, if your advice is based solely on Dell letting you down then you are not the right person for that job.[–]zdevilinside[S] 2 points3 points4 points 11 days ago(5 children)I guess that you think it is fair that I have had to make 4 special trips back to the US during my sabbatical year to get systems replaced/repaired/exchanged.  Each trip cost me over $1000; the amount spent on the trips cost me more than I spent on the top-of-the-line system.  Further, every single time I have had to deal with these issues I have been treated poorly by the \"customer service\" team.  They told me straight out that if I wanted my work done overseas during my sabbatical year that I would have to get an i7, 3070 ti (at best) instead of the i9, 3080ti.  Is that a fair exchange?Have you read how many people have had problems with Dell systems that have posted on here?  There is enough to cause concern.  You can scroll through the previous posts on here and see just how many people that have had poor service and support; you can see how many people have had problems with their systems. It isn't a small amount.Dell has gotten to the point that they do not really care about their consumer products - they think you MIGHT buy 3 or 4 systems in a decade and therefore blow them off in comparison to the service they provide to businesses that purchase 100 or more during the same time period - it doesn't matter if it is the standard warranty or the Premium Support Pro such as mine has.I have also noticed a marked decline in the Dell business line.  So much so that we had already been talking about cutting back on our Dell purchases and increasing HP in its place.  I had held out to keep the number of Dell purchases the same but after these experiences, I can no longer do so.  Why reward a company for not providing the level of product and service that they should?It took me so long to respond to this message because I was on the phone with Dell's Executive Escalation Team where they said that they can send me out a replacement system where I am traveling but the choices were even worse than previous offerings as exchanges.  Yes, they offered less than a X17 R1, i7, 3080 ti.Can you look me in the eye and tell me that I have gotten what I paid for when I personally have spent close to $5k on systems that have resulted in 4 exchanges/returns, a total of 18 service calls since March, and still doesn't work?  Can you look me in the eye and tell me it is a fair trade by being offered an x15 r2 with i7, 32GB RAM, 3070 ti for a x17 r2 with 64gb ram, 3080 ti and a i9 CPU?  Face it - Dell screwed up here.  I have legitimate reasoning behind the decision to not want to purchase another Dell and why I have made the decision that I have.[–]zdevilinside[S] 2 points3 points4 points 11 days ago(0 children)I just got another call from Dell.  It is amazing how quickly they respond when they find out that there is going to be a loss of such a significant number of system purchases.  They didn't offer me anything different than the 3 previous systems or this one around.[–]Muppet2701 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(3 children)From your post you have clearly been let down by Dell who have treated you poorly. I have been let down by Dell, HP and Lenovo personal use products however in my professional role I have only let how business respond to my professional issues with them influencers my approach to future procurement. I do not work for a government so all my procurement spend is from money my business has earned so the spend is always what is best for the business not me personally, I would hope that anyone who has influence over spending tax dollars would look for best procurement and not use their position to settle a personal score.[–]zdevilinside[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(2 children)Asus treated me this poorly back in 2008 - I haven't spent a dime on them since.  The organization I work for has shown a significant increase in problems with Dell systems over the last few years; HP's has remained stable at about the same level as it has been over the last 10.  If you see an increase of equipment trouble tickets go from .4 % of systems to 3.5% of all systems you buy, do you see an issue?  Last year was the worst at 3.5% for Dell.  The year prior it was at 2.8% which is about the level we had with HP.  HP's response time for tickets that have hardware component replacement is about the same as Dell's.  This is more than just a personal score; it is something that is a trend by Dell over the last few years - putting out a product that has decreased in reliability and support.  The Product Advisory Council and Change Control Boards (which I am a member) have previously discussed the increase in purchasing of HP systems over Dell due to the uptick in problems we have had with Dell.  I was one of the people that continued to push for Dell despite the increase in trouble tickets.  I do not believe I can do so after their 8 P's failures.  Is it a personal score settlement when you have already been considering the change prior to the issue in question?  No, it isn't.  It is the acceptance of the reality that a company you supported is no longer offering the quality that can be supported.If you saw that significant of an increase in faulty systems where the competition is actually putting out a better product, would you change?  Would a personal \"grudge\" as you think this is be enough to finally cause you to no longer be a hold out on the change others have wanted?[–]Muppet2701 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(1 child)If it is not a personal score then the fair enough, reading the original post it appeared that it may have been. I hope you get resolution from Dell as the issues you describe are appalling.[–]skastoger 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(4 children)I want to upgrade two of my old Dell all-in-one desktops and latest m15 R2  to x17 in February, I used to have 1060 and 2060 Alienware laptops, great company, I only use Dell products and will stay with them.[–]zdevilinside[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 11 days ago(3 children)I have been a Dell-certified technician since 1999.  When I come back from my sabbatical, I will be returning to my job with the US government where I sit on the Product Advisory Council, and the Change Control Boards.  We have the choice of HP and Dell business line systems.  I will be pushing for HP at this point.[–]MogRulesArea51mR1 / M15R5 Ryzen / Aurora R13 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(2 children)Why are they offering you a lesser system? That does not makes any sense, it goes against their own rules.  Simply explain that you will not accept a lesser system, that should be the end of that conversation.  I will flag this up on my end and see if we can get someone to look into it.[–]zdevilinside[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)Exchange would take place outside the US is why.  They have to exchange with something that is allowed to be sold in the country that the exchange takes place.  They also decrease it due to the tariffs that have to be paid on the device upon their shipping it to me.[–]zdevilinside[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)I am traveling extensively during my sabbatical year doing volunteer work all over the world but predominantly in Mexico and other Central American countries.  The next 2 weeks will be in Australia and then 2 weeks in New Zealand.  After that, I will be in Mexico for 6 to 8 weeks and then Honduras for a week or so.  Back to Mexico for another 5 to 8 weeks then home to the US for a week.  If I want an exchange to take place while I am in Mexico and Central America, I either take the lesser system or make a special trip back to the US to do the exchange.[–]zrezer 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)Good to hear, don’t allow yourself to be pushed around by them because you are right—they do not care.[–]anonimoise -1 points0 points1 point 11 days ago(1 child)When I had a problem with Dell I emailed their CEO directly.

Howard Elias' email address won't accept emails from outside of Dell - it bounced back to me.  The rest have resulted in ghosting.  I don't have a lot of enthusiasm with Dell anymore.[–]Sweaty-Barber1971 -1 points0 points1 point 11 days ago(8 children)For my private business dell has been number one due to stability and support, we have band HP because of unreliability and non existent support, we don't really like Lenovo because of the non removable bloatware, we also band razer blads because of their dangerous battery issues, for my company anyways Dell has been the best even as going as far as giving us upgrades for free[–]zdevilinside[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(7 children)In our case, we been tracking how many systems we have had issues with during their 3 year life cycles at our facility.  HP has remained pretty steady at 2.2-2.4% over the last 3 years.  Dell has gone from a 1.8% to 3.5% over the same period.The facility I work for spends about $100m on computers each year.  The majority of that money is in the high performance computing section but the rest is in the range of 10k-12k desktop/laptops and servers.  About 70% of that is Dell, the rest is split pretty equally between Apple and HP.[–]Sweaty-Barber1971 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(6 children)At our different facilities, over a 3 year life cycle Dell systems remain steady anywhere between 0.8% to 1.2%, our Dell systems are exclusively XPS and Alienware laptops, also keep in mind the systems that did fail got replaced fast and for a newer model by Dell,Now for out HP systems, over a 3 year life cycle system failure rate stays anywhere between 5.6% to 6%,Our Lenovo systems over the same period has a failure rat of 3.8% to 3.9%Our MacBooks have a failure rate of 0.9% to 1.4%Our Razer Blades have a failure rate of 9% because of the battery expanding,Overall Dell has been number one for my company aswell as I use dell for my personal systems.We have lost thousands of millions because of the unreliability of other systems,Also keep in mind my company uses exclusively laptops[–]zdevilinside[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(5 children)We use Optiplex and Latitude systems.  We spend about $100m a year on desktop computing systems.  The fact is that we are seeing an even greater percentage of Dell systems needing part replacements in the last few years - to the point of 3.5% now.

Which is a shame because I like Dell’s XPS laptops just fine.[–]ProtonSubaru 2 points3 points4 points 12 days ago(0 children)Why not just buy a cheap fractal case and mobo? You can switch everything else over to the new case and mobo. Switching fans on the Alienware is a bitch because only certain types work and they all need to be connected like it came. I made mine work fine but I did the research first[–]Raztax 3 points4 points5 points 12 days ago(0 children)Also when you open the case the cost cutting is staggering.This and the computer cases with very poor air flow are my biggest issues with AW.

Love it, it was also the only way I could get an RTX 3090.  The only weirdness I have is now and then it would spontaneously reboot, I did tons and tons of diagnostics but it did eventually stop..

It was built like a tank yet still very portable and performed very well for its size and price.[–]Khainyte 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(0 children)Alienware M15 r 2 that I bought in 2015 still going strong. Daily driver for work when we went work from home. What failed on me was an EVGA 1080 that died in 2020 right before 30 series cards and crypto went full stupid.New job, so it probably won't be doing much these days as I replaced it with a X17 r1.[–]IndigenousShrek 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(0 children)I just got an R13, I used to use a mid HP laptop that lasted me 9, and it wasn’t even for gaming. I’m hoping my new one will last for at least 6+ years, as I take good care of my electronics (my 2013 3Ds I use nearly everyday, and all I have had to do was get a bigger SD card and a new battery and it worked like new. Also, I still have a GBA, Wii U, and a tablet that I use often that show no signs of stopping anytime soon).\n",

Bought a bunch of parts to build a PC with an Alienware Area 51 R6 motherboard (Socket TR4), putting in an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X in it, already have an EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC 12GB GDDR6 graphics card that’ll be going into this build, looking to buy at least 32GB DDR4 3200Mhz RAM, already have an M.2 512 GB SSD for it and planning on putting in an additional 1TB SSD for storage, still need a PSU, RGB fans, and I really want a RGB liquid cooler and a nice ATX case. Any recommendations? Comment with your suggestions please.[–]waldojim42 1 point2 points3 points 12 days ago*(0 children)I have a TR build that has been running 24/7 since I built it. Homelab server sort of deal. 2990WX/ASRock Taichi/128GB RAM(G.Skill Ripjaw V)/ 3x14TB + 3x8TB EXOS drives/ 1TB NVME... Anyhow - Just going to say that in a BIG ASS case with a LOT of room for a decent cooling loop, these things can and will run terrific. Not great gaming machines, but wonderful workstations or small servers.Now, obviously, from here on, this is what I have done, so I will simply state that I am 100% happy with the choices I made here, which is why I am listing it out. Obviously, to each their own.First thing to keep in mind: Memory clock speeds are going to suck if you populate all channels. Worse, if you try to run at CPU limits. Meaning high capacity dual rank kits in your case. You can likely get 128GB on that board, but like me, you are going to end up with RAM clocks down around 2800Mhz or so. If you go low density, up to 64GB, you should be able to hold between 3000 and 3200Mhz.I would not suggest going CLLC for these though, very few that can properly cover all the chiplets. EK has a decent collection of TR4 water blocks, I can tell you they work well on this platform.I went with a ThermalTake 900 Snow edition case, XSPC 480mm slim radiator  with 4x Phantec static pressure fans and the Thermaltake water pump+res combo unitThat thing cools well enough to leave a 2080 super in the loop if you want, or let those fans run slow and silent only handling the CPU. That specific case will support up to 2x480mm radiators, so it can handle quit a decent thermal load in there.Now, that is just what I did - as I was looking for a machine that was 24/7 stable. I don't overclock that machine.Also for that machine, I run a PC Power and Cooling Silencer 1050 - been using that in there since I built this machine - Feb 19. Still working perfectly. Bought a second for my primary gaming rig as well recently. Never had a bad PC P&C unit.Edit: Oh - and get something decent for the top mounted exhaust fans. Those things are trash, bearings when out well within the first year. I believe I have double ball bearing Arctic fans up there now.[–]bitcoinalbert87[S] 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago*(0 children)<image>Ended up buying this Lian Li / Der8auer PC-O11DW Case for $100.00 from a local guy. He attempted a build with a 4090 GPU which ended up not fitting in the case. He couldn’t return it because he threw away the original box. Long story short his loss is my gain. He originally paid $240.00 for it on Amazon.[–]bitcoinalbert87[S] [score hidden] 1 hour ago(0 children)Posting an update. So far I’ve received the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X processor, the 32GB (4X8) Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro RAM kit, TeamGroup MP33 512GB M.2 SSD (main drive), also bought Lian Li Strimer Show extensions (24 pin and  8 pin), Enermax 120mm RGB fans (6 pack), and Enermax AIO Liqtech 360mm Liquid Cooler TR4 OC Edition.

This is what controls the AlienFX so if you don’t have it then you’ll need to find one. Some third party motherboards just work fine with the Alienware MIO board but some don’t. You need to change a windows registry to get it to work in some systems but some aren’t possible at all. There used to be a detailed guide on the Alienowners forum but it was shut down this year.

A service in which a purchaser from outside the US buys a product in the US and ships to a domestic address (the service) then the item is forwarded along to your foreign address.  The non-US billing address is throwing them off.  There's an Alienware account that pokes its head in here from time to time, but the username eludes me.  Maybe another redditor in this sub can tag them.They should honor the warranty.  You've never taken the product out of the country of origin.

I probably should have stepped up to the 32gb ram version but I was happy taking that few hundred and putting it into peripherals. Will prolly get a desktop down the line that I can upgrade as the x14 is mainly for work trips.\n",

I bet that deal is on Dell Canada for like 2500 lol.Anywho, on to the point. The G16 is decent kit, but lacks one crucial thing (unless they've changed it) no expandable storage. It gets one nVME slot, thats it. It even has the internal connector for one but it's not populated. Dumb dumb decision by Dell.I think the raider would be built better too at least from what I've read. I haven't touched that particular model, last one in my hands I think was a 66 but I could be mistaken.Overall,  the higher end GPU on the Dell would definately  e better than the Raider. So its hard to say, if you want pure performance, keep the G16. If you want storage options and build quality go with the Raider.[–]Goldenmonkey27[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago(1 child)Ah I feel sorry for you! I appreciate the advice.

It's just general advice.[–]Clayton2k 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago(0 children)100% if you're blind and buy something visibly broken. It should be pretty apparent. When you install the hinges I would tighten them, if needed, it is easily done with needle nose pliers.  I have purchased and replaced at least 25 without issue. The real issue is people not fixing it fast enough and torquing' the hell out of the system and breaking the shell, screen, lid etc....[–]IkouyDaBolt 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)I've worked as a repair technician and not all shops are able to stock parts; so it is possible they're going to have to order the parts so it's not going to be an instant fix.If it's under warranty some warranties allow either overnight of parts or a technician to go to your place of residence.[–]smokepotandwatch 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago(0 children)I own a dell vostro 3510 and your inspiron chassis and keyboard layout  looks extremely similar to mine . I guess I was right to just leave my laptop open most of the time (the laptop is just over  a year old and I have closed the top lid maybe 40 times total) guess what ?? the bezel to the left of the screen was broken and I discovered it yesterday when I added some more ram . The break is really small and a little bit of super glue should render the broken part invisible . Really goes to show the type of build quality dell has on lower mid range models. Also I use my laptop plugged in most of the time .Truly sorry for what you are going through and I hope it gets fixed . Best of luck.[–]DeathAlgorithm 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago(0 children)But how do you OPEN your laptop?I am very curious[–]jc1luv 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago(0 children)Have you ever taken a laptop apart? If so, then you can repair this. To be o. The safe side, I would oder the plamrest, which is where the hinges scrrw on, also the hinge assembly along with the screen back cover. Those are your 3 parts for point of failure. Out of those 3, at least 2 will need replacing, the hinges and the screen back cover, the palm rest is yet to see\n",

(both while the techs were remoted into the system.) in searching the internet and here on reddit, i have seen many complaints about this issue but no solutions. can dell please help with this issue!!! there is also the dreaded \"device cannot start error 10\" message which is no help. there were 6 system log messages from mtconfig about not being able to configure the device – the detail info is below: log name: system source: mtconfig date: 1/8/2023 9:55:01 am event id: 1 task category: none level: error keywords: classic user: n/a computer: wandaslt description: an attempt to configure the input mode of a multitouch device failed. event xml: <event xmlns=[http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3a%2f%2fschemas.microsoft.com%2fwin%2f2004%2f08%2fevents%2fevent&data=05%7c01%7c%7ccd5e0e7561904b6a7a8808daf18d9746%7c84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7c1%7c0%7c638087887677288455%7cunknown%7ctwfpbgzsb3d8eyjwijoimc4wljawmdailcjqijoiv2lumziilcjbtii6ik1hawwilcjxvci6mn0%3d%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=f7cpsbqg23k5l%2ftdufiqtpgajb4i50n3ylzc2t4pid0%3d&reserved=0)\\> <system> <provider name=\"mtconfig\" /> <eventid qualifiers=\"49157\">1</eventid> <version>0</version> <level>2</level> <task>0</task> <opcode>0</opcode> <keywords>0x80000000000000</keywords> <timecreated systemtime=\"2023-01-08t14:55:01.0359904z\" /> <eventrecordid>12465</eventrecordid> <correlation /> <execution processid=\"4\" threadid=\"13352\" /> <channel>system</channel> <computer>wandaslt</computer> <security /> </system> <eventdata> <data> </data> <binary>000000000100280000000000010005c000000000840100c000000000000000000000000000000000</binary> </eventdata> </event>\n",

You can use either regular DDR3 or DDR3L it doesn't really care.Honestly tho, with a machine that old, I probably wouldn't bother upgrading it. Save your money and get a newer machine.[–]redgreenbluedude[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(1 child)Thanks a lot 👍It's for an elderly couple who are not interested in a new pc  - and I figure the ram upgrade will breathe a bit more life in it (and cost of regular ddr3 ram is pretty low, so I think it's worth a shot)[–]GMoney7304 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)More (and faster) memory does tend to have a noticeable difference in performance. But the absolute best upgrade IMO for an old pc is to replace the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) with a Solid State Drive (SSD). SSD's are quite cheap nowadays and it can make a night and day difference in usability. \n",
      "That said, it's a definitely bit more complicated than swapping ram, it's not something I'd attempt if you're not very tech savvy.

Some have multiple screens.  HD (720), FHD (1920x1080), touch/non-touch.  For best results replace like for like.Also check the Dell warranty status on Dell's site and see if you have complete care or accident damage coverage.[–]CiroZorro 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(7 children)Use https://www.laptopscreen.com/ or search Amazon, you need a better model number than Inspiron 15 3000 to make sure you get the right replacement, you are looking at $60-100 for a replacement screen.Can you share your Dell Service tag, from that I can tell you the exact part number.[–]antoniocjp 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)I'd start here: https://www.dell.com/en-us/lp/fixyourpc[–]Fidelio40 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(0 children)Mexico![–]w9s9 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago(0 children)Punch your brother back[–]6clu 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)If you want the harsh reality of it: their isn’t going to be anything you can do quickly unless the damage is very minor (which I doubt due to the half screen working, other half not). So whether or not you can have it for school in the couple of days, the answer is no. In regards to the damage: \n",
      "- It’s worth taking the screen panel off and checking it to make sure the screen hasn’t been dislodged, whilst I doubt it has under the state it could just be a simple repair like that - do not do this while the computer is on though as we don’t need you causing more damage then it’s worth. \n",
      "- Ensure if you do take the LCD out to not apply pressure to the screen in the event damage was only minor.\n",
      "- Upon removal, check pins and connectors for deformity. If the connecting element to the laptop is bent, then do not buy a new LCD and either consider taking it to a specialist or getting a new laptop (it will be more costly due to more repairs being needed). In regards to getting it repaired:\n",
      "- A new screen is going to cost you about 50/60 USD. Luckily it’s not a rare screen to replace. \n",
      "- You have to make sure you find one identical to your laptop design set up, in regards to the Inspiron series it’s important you check the mountings (at the top and bottom) are the same in order to make sure it fits your computer. \n",
      "- Check your warranty, Dell have a warranty system which only requires your product code (it’s on the box). If you are still in warranty, send it to them and they’ll repair it. \n",
      "- You could make the repair yourself, but theirs an applied risk to this. Not to call out people in the comments, but a lot of them will not do the repairs themselves and although despite computers being quite simple theirs bits which can go wrong. \n",
      "- Take it to your local tech repair centre, most of the time they have insurance and tools on hand. They can give you a quote and buying screens then is not your concern.I’m not sure how hard you hit your brother, but i think he deserves it in light of the situation.[–]Slimshadeopteryx 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)Well, good luck with that..  if you don't physically need to take it to school, you can probably plug in a desktop Monitor and it will work just fine for now.The second question then is how old is the machine, and is it still under warranty from Dell?  An Inspiron is a basic home user/consumer model, and I will pretty much guarantee it does not have Dell Prosupport, especially PS plus - aka on site in home repair, and accidental damage coverage.  So you will need to send it away to Dell for repair, which could take 2 weeks or more.  You also obviously can't convince Dell that this happened as a result of manufacturing defect, so it will be an out-of-pocket cost as well.So the short answer is, you're screwed. It will not be fixed in 2 days, and you will need to pay for repairs, and you will also need to send it away for repairs. Replacing the LCD screen could be $150, or potentially more.  If it isn't under warranty, any computer shop can do the repairs for about the same price. They would simply order the parts from Dell and do the replacement for you, it actually only takes a couple of hours at most so potentially someone local could do so same-day.Obviously your brother should pay for it out of his allowance or whatever money he earns from a part-time job.[–]unclemarv 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago(0 children)Ugh… where is mom and dad? They should be making little brother feel back AND responsible. If he’s really young, they should pay for the repair and garnish his allowance until he can pay.\n",

I have already changed the battery and power settings to stop the screen from turning off and it’s obviously not working.[–]arnole999 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(0 children)First thought is that there might be a short circuit happening? I remember dealing with something similar on my mums old Latitude (I think, it was a 13\" 3rd gen i5 business laptop) which was damaged by a soda spill on a keyboard and the function key for sleep would randomly short out. In our case, as the laptop is already used from a distance plugged into the TV with a wireless keyboard, I just took out the damaged keyboard and the shorts were eliminated. I don't have much experience with Dell laptops, 4 in total, but I would guess that if there's a short from the touchpad, you'd be able to check that by unplugging it and the cable is usually under the keyboard, otherwise a site like iFixit might have a better guess. Also, and this depends on the laptop itself, but there might be an option to turn off the touchpad from the BIOS.Also, does the laptop shut off if using an external mouse? As you've mentioned that left click shuts it off.[–]su_A_ve 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago(1 child)Boot and run diagnostics. Does it happen there too?

      "content: i am not sure why on the dell website, the docking station compatibility list shows that the inspiron 16 plus is not compatible. i have the model with the nvidia 3060 graphics card and it has a thunderbolt 4 port. here is my setup: https://preview.redd.it/q1o0pfswy99a1.jpg?width=1775&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4e4089a40ac3177b092b0d41f589f7c23f72789e i was able to get three displays working since the two monitors on the sides are 1600 x 900, while the lg monitor is 2160 x 1080. i honestly do not care about 4k at this moment. since the dock has 2 displayports and 1 hdmi port, that made it work perfectly. i am going to guess i will only be able to connect two 4k monitors and the third one will not work. connecting three that are somewhere near or at 1080p, no issues. my 2 external drives connect with no issues. transfer speeds are very fast too. ethernet works without a problem. i have a mesh system and speed tests show i can get over 800 mbps up and down when directly connected to the satellite router since i have gigabit internet. i think what tops this off is the charging, the power button on the dock, and the way the graphics card handles the monitors. my laptop has a barrel connector charger. when i plug in third-party usb-c chargers that are over 130w, it shows the charging slow warning, which can get annoying. i was expecting something like this to happen when using this dock, even though it says it can power deliver up to 130w. the result was completely the opposite. i did not see the charger warning appear when i plugged it in. i went into the bios setup and confirmed it was getting the full 130w watts without an issue. i know some have issues with the power button built into the dock not working all the time to turn the computer. the power button works without an issue when turning it on or putting it to sleep. what i find interesting is how the computer handles the way it outputs external monitors. when i plug in a monitor using the built-in hdmi port, it does not use the intel graphics card, (when using the internal screen), it actually turns on the nvidia graphics card and uses it to output the monitor. i did not know if the usb-c port is capable of using the nvidia graphics card as well, until now. when i connected everything. all three monitors are running on the nvidia graphics card without a problem. the intel one stays at 0% after closing the lid. i did some light gaming on it to see what it can do. it performed much better than i anticipated. i know it is not a gaming laptop, but it was cool that it is capable of high-performance usage when needed. i do not see any reason why the dock is showing as \"not compatible\" when it clearly works without an issue with the inspiron 16 plus 7620 laptop. ​ in short or tl;dr. the wd22tb4 docking station works flawlessly with all three monitors and external devices connected. charging, the power button, and the way it outputs the monitors work great as well.\n",

Right now, there's 3 chrome tab open, 1 tab with spotify music playing, one with reddit open and one with facebook open. The bottom of my laptop is noticeably hot. It was worse before and cpu was hitting 100c just with little activity. Then I turned off the turbo booster and it got a little better. It stopped hitting ridiculously high degrees but the stabilized degrees are still around 50-60c.Right now, I turned off the turbo booster, it's on battery saver mode, and it's not charging. But even with this, without looking the cpu temp screen, just by touching the bottom and the keyboard of the laptop, i'd say the degrees are around 80 celsius. It never affected the performance even though it hit 100c. But still, It's so uncomfortable and annoying. I've had heating issues only when I played games with my previous laptops. I didn't play games with this laptop and yet the heating became an trouble just by watching youtube.Whenever I post about the heating issue, all the advices i've got are, \"change the thermal paste\", \"clear the dust of the fan\". But I think the main issue is just the laptop. I think this model has terrible cooling management.

If you want the best cooling performance your device can handle and are okay opening it up you can likely obtain a decent amount by replacing the trash thermal paste OEMs like dell put on CPUs, just replace it with some Kryonaut from Thermal Grizzly and you should see a decent improvement. Ultimately the problem here is that Intel's U processors are 28w (TDP) parts now and that implies that they boost up pretty high initially to give users a sense of more performance than older models, but that renders the anemic 1 pipe heatsink of your Inspiron useless when it's boosting up. I personally don't think any CPU should be reaching 50C on 2.0w of power, that's ridiculous to me.[–]sparttraonics 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(1 child)Yup.[–]Bilguun-M-0409[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)It was on battery saver modeNo chargingTurbo booster was offI was doing almost little to nothing (listening music on spotify on chrome with another reddit and facebook tab open)I feel like it's not normal to stay around 50-60c.

So this generation with the screen lifting up the laptop is meant to help the fans draw in more air from the bottom and put it out by the hinge area. I have a vostro 7500 with the same design and a lot more powerful CPU and GPU. It's a bad thermal design. They really need a side vent too which you can see on some other Intel 12th Gen vostro and Inspiron models.Anyway I just prop the screen hinges up with a cork mat or book to help more cool air from the bottom.[–]NonKevin 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)double check the fan is running.  If you had the laptop for a while, your thermo paste may have caked and needs to be replaced.[–]oliver88128 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago*(4 children)i have a dell inspiron 3511. the temperature is normal for the laptop.if you want a lower temp , set the thermal mode to cooling mode.if you really want to do something to lower the temperature, then replace the  thermal paste with Honeywell thermal pad. it will lower the temp 5~10 degree.the dell thermal system keeps the temp between 50~60 degree to reduce fan noise in balance or quiet mode.[–]Bilguun-M-0409[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(3 children)How to set thermal mode to cooling mode? Isn't that the same thing as turning off the turbo booster?Also, how long you've been using your laptop? Anything bad about the laptop that will happen overtime?Are you satisfied with this laptop?[–]oliver88128 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago(2 children)oh, you are right. when the turbo is disabled, there is no difference between the cooling and quite mode .in non-turbo mode, the laptop temp is less than 60 degree. so fan is not working.at the moment, i don't know what the difference will be between the two modes if the laptop thermal is bad and temp reaches 70~80 degree under workload.and i have been using this laptop for 1 year. in my case, i use this laptop only for web browsing.the build quality of this laptop is very poor.after a year of use, the trackpad is starting rattle and the bottom rubber suddenly disappeared. and sometimes burn-in is observed on the screen.as a programmer , i am not satisfied with this laptop. but we can't expect more than that because this is inspiron 3000 series.so i bought a new dell precision 3571 and i am happy with it.[–]Bilguun-M-0409[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(1 child)and i have been using this laptop for 1 year. in my case, i use this laptop only for web browsing.Why? Is there wrong with using this laptop for something more (like programming)?build quality of this laptop is very poor.Damn, I'm screwed.so i bought a new dell precision 3571 and i am happy with it.Aside from the better heat management, build quality, and 12th gen chip, what's better about precision 3571 compared to inspiron 3511? How comparable is it?[–]oliver88128 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago(0 children)besides the better thermal management, better build quality, better performance management, what we need more for a laptop ?i can do anything i want with the precision 3571.(programming, gaming with medium configuration, watching video for a longtime on battery mode)of course , you can do programming on your  inspiron 3511 laptop.however you can face thermal issues when working in more heavy environments like android studio with android emulator.in my case, the laptop was frozen after playing cs-go.(it could be a thermal problem)but don't worry too much. the inspiron 3511 laptop is still working. and i used the laptop for programming for 6 months before buying the precision 3571 laptop.the worst issues iwth the dell inspiron 3511 are thermal management and build quality.besides that, the 4 core laptop can handle most workloads.enjoy your laptop and take care of it like a baby.(i didn't try to repaint the thermal paste on the inspirion. maybe i could try it in near days)[–]amanfromthere 0 points1 point2 points 11 days ago(0 children)We sell a fair amount of refurb dells.  First thing I do is replace thermal paste because 75% of them run 60+ at idle and 90+ max.  Drops the temp 20+ degrees usually.​That being said, those temps are totally fine.  Ones with cooling / thermal paste issues will easily peg 90-100.  That's where the damage comes.\n",

      "content of comments: (1 child)Dell has an \"ID\" chip inside the charger, to \"avoid using low quality chargers that might damage your equipment\"(which I kinda call BS, but I can see how using a lower wattage brick and/or unstable charger can damage your laptop if you're not careful).It seems that the issue might be the cable and/or charger itself and not the laptop.Try either replacing the charger for another of same wattage that also has the ID (properly says for DELL, make sure to check other reviews about it, otherwise get another original dell charger), or DIY fix it.Since you said you need to bend it weirdly I assume the ID wire broke(split open(open circuit, not connected)), hence when you bend it, the broken halves touch and it works.You can try fixing DIY it by getting a new single wire, and replacing all the way from the brick to the connector itself, or trying to find where the break is, cutting that part open carefully and mending the wire. Unless the \"fold\" you need to make it's very close/on the connector itself, then you'd need to cut it open to re-solder the wires(or just mend by peeling the cables a bit and twisting , which I've done in the past but soldering is more preferable because you won't have to worry about wires coming loose), which can be done with a box cutter(utility knife?) but be careful because it's sharp and prone to sliding(I got a deep cut on my fingers multiple times like that lol)[–]JFalc27[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 days ago(0 children)Thanks for the help, when I took it in the first time they took off the bottom cover and plugged it in and it charged perfectly fine.

Reboot into the bios, see if the HD is seen, if not, reseat the cables to the HD and motherboard.  While open, check if its an Hd not an SSD that the disk is spinning.  If not, likely the disk board is out, you will need a replacement and reload software including licensing.  If you can find and evil twin HD, switch the board out.  If the HD is seen in the bios, you will need to repair the disk structure.  I do this on a different PC running chkdsk ?: /R and then with the HD reinstalled in the original PC, attempt repairs with F5/F8 if it does not boot up properly.[–]BenjiHoggi 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(0 children)I think I might know the problem.

Check your fans for dust and clean them.I also would recommend to do a clean install of Windows just to be sure that no bloat is installed on it. But this is a lot of work though.

This is more involved, but if thermals are a problem and you’ve done everything else then this is still a pretty easy next step (you should do this anyway, it’s good to reapply thermal paste every so often).[–]Azzim_N 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago(0 children)You could send your laptop to your local computer shop,or try researching on how to clean dust from laptop and do it yourself\n",

      "content of comments: (1 child)Feel free to ignore this answer.If you want no fan noise and you really only need a web browser, you could consider a MacBook Air M1. They have no fans whatsoever and great battery life. You can install Chrome or Firefox if you have a browser preference. It also supports Brave browser, Opera browser, and several others.If you prefer Linux, it's now possible to install a native Linux on them with hardware support improving every few months (see the Asahi Linux website for details).Currently they are US$800 on Amazon US (with \"good\" quality refurb units as low as $703).Of course, if you are set on using Windows or the price won't work for you, just ignore this. Thanks for reading.HTH.[–]smartshader 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago(0 children)For someone who used both dell inspiron and macbook m1. I cannot stress this enough. Macbook m1 is way better performance, stability, battery life, temperature if you put it on your lap, and lifespan over inspiron and latitude.[–]jc1luv 4 points5 points6 points 19 days ago(2 children)When you can go latitude, never go inspiron. Latitudes have better specs and are tuned to handle workloads. Plus, their cooling system is better.\n",
      "Either way you go, me sure it's a 4 core processor. Both models have a 2 core lineup, and that will definitely have the fans running more often because of the extra work the processor has to do.\n",
      "It also helps to look at all the specs. Make sure it's at least a 2.5 ssd if the laptop doesn't have an m.2 slot yet. But most latitudes will as far as 2017 if I'm not wrong.

You just look at the processors name on the Intel website. For the fans to go off, there's more than one thing at play. Depends on the cooling system, overall machine specs, for example, if you also have a dedicated GPU that adds to the overall temperature of the machine. Also, programs that you use, some programs are very demanding. But as I mentioned latitudes, at least the 5 or 7 series are nicely tuned, and unless you're running a very demanding program. Fan noise is minimal, if any. Currently, I use a 5420 with an i5, nvme 512gb, and 16gb ram ddr4, and that thing makes no noise whatsoever. At least I don't notice it. My 5760 makes more noise, but that one runs a 4k display on an nvidia card, and I'm always editing or watching 4k content.[–]wrathofnothing[S] 1 point2 points3 points 19 days ago(10 children)I wanted to buy old models 2017-2020 since they're cheaper and because i wont use any program mostly, only chrome for basic things + youtube/netflix every now and then, i have been using Inspiron N5110 for 8 years and it was awesome and always quiet until 3 days ago where the fan started kicking on every few seconds when the GPU reaches 51C even after i replaced fans so i figured it's better to go for another laptop.[–]jc1luv 1 point2 points3 points 19 days ago(9 children)Try replacing thermal paste.. that could yield good thermals.\n",

      "So I was going over both listings, I want to say both machines are built on top of the same chasis, so cosmetically, there will be minor minor differences. The differences will be internally. I know the price difference is a whole hundred, but I obviously go with the newer 5591. Simply because the i5 is an 8th gen with double the thread count as the i5 7th gen. The 8th gen were pretty reliable processors.\n",
      "Another difference I see is the storage. The newer one does mention it is an ssd, I'm hoping it's an NVME, but even a sata ssd is already good. The second laptop only says HD, no mention if it's an hhd mechanical drive or ssd. If it's mechanical, I would immediately replace it to at least a Sata ssd. Thirdly, the ram on the 5591 has a higher frequency, though not a huge difference, nevertheless. \n",
      "The one thing I didn't see is the battery size, if either have the smaller 50wh, if you're planning on moving it around a ton, eventually, you might want to get a 90wh size. You'll. Be happier.As far as cooking, both have the same chasis. The difference is in the processor. The gen 7 might work harder, so the fan might kick in more than the gem 8. It's just a theory.\n",
      "In the end, i would choose the newer model, mostly because of the processor.\n",
      "One last thing, I have never used either machine, so it's just my opinion, and I knew someone who had a 5580 for work, and they did mention it was loud in fan noise. But mainly because they ran a program that was very demanding.\n",

All core max turbo would probably be around the neighborhood of 2.9-3.5GHz or so depending on factors such as max power draw allowed by your laptop, turbo boost time limit and CPU running temperatures.So take the values as the CPU being able to run between a range of 1.6GHz to 3.9GHz, with all core boost speeds being roughly in the middle, and usually always higher than 1.6GHz.[–]jc1luv 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago(0 children)1.60 is more than enough for average use.

The real difference is that Inspiron are consumer laptops sold at retailers with 1 year warranty while Latitude are enterprise ones sold to corporate clients with 3-year warranty the covers on-site service.  Typically, the mid-to-higher-end Latitudes are going to be more durable than Inspirons.    Each model with each configuration is going to have a different level of fan noise and cooling needs.   Someone mentioned the the MacBook Air M1-- it's true that no Windows at a similar performance level will run as quiet as the M1. So if that's your priority and you are ok with MacOS, then go for it (and every operating system is capable of web-browsing).   For just web-browsing though, there are some low-powered and lowish-performance 6w/9w Celeron and Pentiums that often come in fan-free inexpensive Windows laptops and Chromebooks. For example, Dell's Latitude 3120, a school laptop.\n",

Sometimes the connections are the same but the supported res is different. Sometimes its the connection size, could be 30pin or 40pin and other variations.If its the same pin connector but its not supported by your GPU, you'll simply have either a black screen or random colors but could mess up your machine.I've replaced screens before but even if other configurations are allowed, I've never ordered any resolution that is not native to that specific model. What I normally do is pull the display out and order the same replacement model/part.If there are other configurations with your machine, it could be because they had dedicated GPUs as well, so if your machine only has dedicated, that's possibly why you can't use other resolutions.Im curious to what you find out.

      "content of comments: (1 child)This is absolutely a thing. I've had older Inspiron's and loved them. Got the 7610 and had the renowned touchpad issue on there. The 7620 is a different model of touchpad so thought hey surely Dell can't mess it up again but yep.Luckily I feel this one is software related. If you uninstall the driver and restart you'll find some temp relief but that may be anywhere from minutes to a few days (on only a few occasions so far).Dell are pushing to perform a touchpad replacement but given they had my 7610 for a month and returned it with a dent in and the problem still present, and ultimately I believe it to be a software issue, I'm reluctant.[–]Danny-r95 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago(0 children)I just wanted to add, I've reinstalled Windows, reinstalled individual drivers. Turned power saving settings off in individual HID drivers (this actually did work for a week or 2, they turn back on themselves but actually turning it back off didn't work anymore). This all points to a hardware issue, I'm of the belief that it's still software but that the software is fundamentally flawed, so reinstalling it doesn't fix it because it isn't broken, it's just flawed.\n",

It actually is a lot more comfortable for a lot of reasons.[–]IkouyDaBolt 1 point2 points3 points 26 days ago(2 children)The technical answer has to do with Intel's Turbo Boost technology.  Providing there is enough temperature allowance and power, it will crank the CPU up to full which causes the CPU to reach 90C or so, even if the chassis is cool.  Turning it off will noticeably slow down the CPU, but the fan speeds should be slower and more consistent.Do note, a new Windows install will have a lot of maintenance for the first couple of days.[–]haris936 0 points1 point2 points 23 days ago(1 child)+1 turning off turbo didn't cause much drop in real world performance for me, but the temperatures reduced drastically.

Laptops with the 1650 Ti are built to use the iGPU to produce the video signal so, for example, the i5-10300H will determine how many displays are supported:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/201839/intel-core-i510300h-processor-8m-cache-up-to-4-50-ghz/specifications.htmland in this case, it will be 3 (1 internal, 2 external).This page makes it clear that the 1650 Ti is not producing the video signals:https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-1650-ti-mobile.c3517\"This device has no display connectivity, as it is not designed to have monitors connected to it. Rather it is intended for use in laptop/notebooks and will use the output of the host mobile device.\"​Getting back to your original questions:Is my config enough for 2 QHD monitors + the integrated one (1080p) ?yes.Would a usbc hub to HDMI / DP work for this usecase?yes. In fact, Dell says so: \"NOTE A USB Type-C to DisplayPort adapter (sold separately) is required to connect a DisplayPort device.\"https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/inspiron-15-7501-laptop/inspiron-7501-setup-and-specifications/computers-shipped-with-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-ti-only?guid=guid-c2d636b1-ba00-4e2f-9d9e-34ec91ab3123&lang=en-usIs using DP better than HDMI by any way in this case?possibly. You should be able to get 2560 x 1440 @ 60 Hz from either but you do need to be careful with HDMI adapters (some of them do not support 60Hz and only support 30Hz if you use 2 monitors at the same time). My preference would be DP.If you don't care about extra USB ports (ie, a hub) and you prefer to drive both monitors using the USB-C port, you can probably use a USB-C to Dual DisplayPort Adapter such as:https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-DisplayPort-Adapter-Compatible-Thunderbolt/dp/B0B2ZY2F9Borhttps://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-2-Port-USB-C-DisplayPort-MST/dp/B01KIMP28YI write \"probably\" because I can't vouch for those products - I don't have them and haven't used them so I can't say for certain whether they will work. Based on the reviews in the product's listing, it sounds like it should work.And this is an example of a dual HDMI adapter:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPVGQKYIs the USBC part going to be the bottleneck?I'm not sure what you mean but it's probably \"no\".HTH.\n",

While it may be annoying to you, it serves a purpose (to them).Same thing with your vehicle. It's supposed to run with a precise amount of oil. You may not want to maintain that level of oil for several reasons, but then the burden is on you, not the manufacturer.My laptop fans run a lot more under linux than they do under windows.

Inspirons are aimed at consumers so some will have user friendly features like touchscreen or 2-in-1 capabilities.Vostros are aimed at budget business, so they omit a lot of extra features, but they'll generally be more durable, easier to service, and have extra business oriented features and security.

I then rerun Intel's installer and reinstall the driver for good measure as it includes the audio driver and their software.That being said, is there any reason why you need the driver updated?  I only did it because of Modern Standby, but if everything is working fine using generic drivers does have the issue of odd compatibility issues if Dell has any specific customization with it.[–]MasterPhart[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)So a lot of games that the laptop should be able to run just can't.

      "content of comments: (0 children)I'm an oldhead desktop guy who settles for a low-level laptop to take on the road, so I'm leery of expensive laptops like these. I know many people use laptops as their primary rig, so let's take a look. I think I have the two machine you are considering, but to be sure I've included links.It looks to me like the Inspiron 16+ is a slightly better in nearly every category except weight, which makes sense given the almost 20% higher price. Depending on what you intend to do with the machine, those little advantages might or not be worth enough to justify the added cost.The deal clencher for me would be the lack of the HDMI port on the XPS 15. When I use laptops for presentations, I like to have as many choices as possible and HDMI is almost always one of the choices even in the jankiest of locations. I wouldn't want to depend on a laptop without an HDMI port. If that's not an issue for you or you don't mind carrying a few adapters, then you should disregard this.Your observation about the display choices (FHD and 3k, etc.) is a good one. It helps to know what matters to you and what just doesn't.If you are buying a Dell support plan, it's worth checking to see if the graphics card in the Inspiron 16+ is covered. My guess is that it is not, so that's something to be clear about.Personally, I would prefer upgrading the drive in either machine to at least 1 TB (and more if this was my primary device) but that's quite dependent on what OS and applications you intend to install.[–]pewpew62 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)That Inspiron 16+ is gigantic.

      "content of comments: (0 children)I got 5 years out of my last Inspiron. I only replaced it because the finish on the plastic touchpad began chipping away making the tactile experience worse than just unpleasant. It's living its second life now as my kid's Chromebook after installing Brunchwork on it and it works better than an actual Chromebook. Bought in Jan 2016[–]dukeblue219 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Honestly, that's a long time to expect from an Inspiron. It may last that long, and your work might be accepting of the possible need to replace or repair. A more straightforward recommendation is a Precision if you can swing it.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)As /u/dukeblue219 mentioned, you probably need to look at better built machines than Inspiron which are designed for regular home users who aren't willing to pay more than certain price points for a laptop. As a result, Inspirons don't last as long.The 2 lines which are regarded as longer-lasting are Precision and Latitude. Search this sub for posts about them to see what others think about them.You could also consider XPS because many XPS models and Precision models share the same chassis and internals.\"You get what you pay for\" is very true with laptops.HTH.[–]Danny-r95 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)The main issue with \"You get what you pay for\" is the line has moved on it it seems. Premium priced laptops are now considered standard. You can buy a £1k laptop and find issues and have people saying \"You get what you pay for\".\n",

      "content of comments: (1 child)According to the manual:https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/inspiron-14-5425-laptop/inspiron-14-5425-setup-and-specifications/external-ports?guid=guid-b8f739cc-a41e-4ac9-b3f8-ff6d9c6d8c19&lang=en-usthe USB 3.2 gen 2 port supports DisplayPort and Power Delivery so a dock with a HDMI or DisplayPort port should work.The problem is whether or not a dock with more than one video port will work. The answer to that is unknown because there does not appear to be any documentation about how many displays are supported by the iGPU (Vega 7) in the Ryzen CPU.If the iGPU only supports 3 displays (connected as: the laptop LCD, the HDMI port, and the USB-C port) then the answer is no. If it supports 4 displays, then it probably would work (no guarantees though).Unfortunately, the CPU spec pages do not specify how many displays are supported:https://www.amd.com/en/product/11631https://www.amd.com/en/product/11601Those are the 2 CPUs that Dell shipped with the 5425. Shame on AMD and Dell. That info should be documented.​I think the safer thing to do is to connect 1 display to the 5425's HDMI port, and the other to the USB-C port (either directly to the monitor or via an adapter or hub). If the monitor connected to the USB-C port can supply power via its USB-C connection, you can power the 5425 via the monitor (no need for the power supply that comes with the laptop). If it does not, you could use a USB-C dock/hub that has power passthrough to both power the laptop and enable one display to be connected.HTH.[–]forestial[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Excellent reply, thanks.

Charging is slower with lower power chargers. My 45w USB-PD charger is the slowest that I use, but it can keep my 7610 from losing charge except when I push the device to its maximum. Since I don't do video processing or run games my heavy loads never last more than a minute or two and then the charging catches back up. My higher wattage chargers (one 65w USB-PD charger and my WD19s dock which charges the 7610 at ~85w via USB-PD protocal) never seem to fail to maintain the charge. None of them will charge a severely depleted battery (low battery after extended battery use) as quickly as the 130w charger connected to the power port (barrel connector).[–]semimute[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Thanks.

Nice to have 4 drives connected at once when organizing files.  See if the 7620 has a listed minimum input power via USB.  I know that the 7573 wants to see 28W, and my ASUS gamer wants 65.  I frequently run the Dell off a PD45 power bank just to make it think that it is plugged in.  I haven't run the hub with the PD45.

I was feeling the air on the back vents on mine when the fans spin faster.  My guess is the reason why they implemented that is to help cool down the higher-performance processors and graphics cards when necessary.I know that the top of the keyboard gets very hot to the touch, so that could be why there are vents in the back.  To avoid more heat from heating up the keyboard.Maybe the reason why one of the vents is blocked is that you do not have a dedicated graphics card, so there was no need to open it.[–]harry9624[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago*(7 children)That was my another concern.

It's not a card that is inserted into a slot. Unfortunately, the graphics chip is unsuitable for VR.This is typical for all-in-one PCs. They are often designed by using parts for mobile (laptop) computers. As such, there is no way to upgrade the graphics \"card\".If you bought the machine new recently, you could return it for a refund. If you can do that, that would probably be for the best. With the refund, you can then use the money to get a normal \"tower\" PC which has normal parts including a graphic card.Depending on how much tech knowledge you (or your son) have, you can either buy a pre-built tower PC (easier but you need to choose the PC carefully so that you get the right specs) or you can select the parts yourself and build your own PC (DIY method).If you prefer a pre-built PC, go to the r/Prebuilts/ subreddit and ask there.If you want a DIY PC, go to the /r/buildapc subreddit. Read some posts there so you get an idea of what it's about. Then when you're ready, post a message with your needs.FWIW, my personal recommendation is to go DIY. You can get the exact parts which are most suitable for your needs and it's usually a fun experience (or rather, it can be a fun experience but it can also be a struggle if you've never done it before, but you can always ask for help).HTH.[–]nova70385[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)Thank you this was very helpful\n",

      "content of comments: (2 children)So, there is a difference between the graphics driver and the graphics hardware.  You can upgrade the driver for the UHD 620 without issue provided you download it from Dell's site.  In due time, this driver will be pushed via Windows Update if no updates are performed.Do not post your tag here, however you can type it in Dell's driver page you posted to narrow down the available drivers.  Underneath check manually click the drop down, then click \"This Device\" and it'll prompt for your Service Tag.  If it determines that your laptop does not have an nVIDIA GPU then the download option for it will disappear.  You can also check the device manager under graphic adapters as well as the task manager (assuming all GPUs have their respective drivers loaded).If you do have nVIDIA hardware I would still use the one on Dell's site provided it is fairly recent as of writing.  Also, you may need to specify which GPU your programs are using.  It's entirely within reason it is crashing because photoshop wants to use the integrated (Intel) graphics and it's just not giving it the required resources.I don't own a Dell laptop with nVIDIA hardware nor use their installers, but I would imagine if the hardware didn't exist it should gracefully fail.[–]MothraMoon[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(1 child)have nVIDIA hardware I would still use the one on Dell's site provided it is fairly recent as of writing.  Also, you may need to specify which GPU your programs are using.  It's entirely within reason it is crashing because photoshop wants to use the integrated (Intel) graphics and it's just not giving it the required resources.There is a specific tool (\"Object Selection\") which is guaranted to make Photoshop crash.It sounded to me like the Graphics Card is welded into the processor, and the driver is the UHS 620. As far as I can tell there is no other graphics card installed. When they said I could not update the driver, it sounded like I was stuck with the UHS 620.There is a setting in Photoshop to \"turn off graphics card.\" It did not make a whole heap of sense to me because I thought a graphics card was sort of the point of this. (There was also anothher setting under \"Technology Previews\" to roll back to \"Pre 2016 graphics/GPU.\"And I am still fuzzy on the difference between GPU and Graphics Processor (until now, I have been using the term as though they are the same thing. The more I learn about this stuff, the more stuff I realize I do not know).In any case, there is only the one graphics driver/processor listed under device manager and that is the UHS 620 [I am not home so I cannot check the task manager]I now realize my system is totally inadquate for what I am using it for (it did not used to be until the last few photoshop updates). With only 8 GB of Ram, I now think I need more like 32 which is overkill. However, my motto is, \"pretty soon overkill will not be enough.\"I also want to be able to run a 1.5 hour MP4 video via Zoom without the fan going nuts. That is actually more important to me than running photoshop. I am wondering if I could get away with 16gb of ram. A Nvida processor, 512 gb internnal storage for less than $2000[–]IkouyDaBolt 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago(0 children)It's a bit complicated, but back in the old days with laptops even integrated graphics were a selection of ICs and chips on the motherboard.  Nowadays it is part of the CPU itself.  On desktops, a discrete (such as nVIDIA) graphics card would turn off the UHD 620 if there was nothing plugged into the latter.  If your computer had an nVIDIA option it would be a secondary graphics chip still soldered onto the motherboard, just a lot more powerful and since it's not integral can be turned on and off at will.A lot of programs don't like graphical acceleration.  Turning off the graphical card in Photoshop would force the CPU to render everything and would slow things down.  If this resolves the issue it might either be incompatible with the UHD 620 or your driver is out of date.  The drivers, the software that tells how to hardware to run, can be updated.GPU and Graphics Processor and so forth are all interchangeable terms.  Usually \"card\" is an addon card on a desktop computer or modular laptop.  My desktop has a graphics card that can be removed and reinstalled if needed.As for the fan issue, I like to experiment with Intel Turbo Boost.  I usually turn it off, but it does reduce fan noise as the CPU only operates within its original specs (which is about half power).  It's a BIOS setting, so if you're unfamiliar with that I would be careful as improper usage can render the system temporarily unusable.\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)Also, the machine does have a dedicated barrel power port. Maybe I should just get another power supply and use the USB-C/TB for docking?[–]DwigGang 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(3 children)If you boot into the BIOS and explore you'll find an option to disable the low power slow charging message.  I've done that on my Inspiron 16 Plus 7610 and I now get the message only on rare occasions. I'm using a Dell WD19s dock with Dell's 130w charger which delivers a little less that the ~90w trigger wattage for the message. The message is somewhat annoying once you know the issue and I wish it was easier to suppress. It just means that the laptop will be charging at a slower rate and might actually loose charge if you have a max'd out machine and are pushing its to its maximum CPU & GPU load, and then only if the low power charging is very low. Even then, it won't hurt anything.[–]adamloughran[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)Thanks for the note. I was able to supress the message at boot up; however, I do get the warning (exclamation point triangle) in Windows 11 battery tray still and my power settings which thinks I am on battery. Do you always see that warning with the Triangle in the battery status notification area?[–]DwigGang 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(1 child)No, and I don't get the indication that it is on battery. But then, my power brick is larger at 130w than USB-PD power bricks so your net power to the computer, after the hub/dock takes its toll, is likely considerably less than what my system delivers to the computer.[–]adamloughran[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Yeah, I just want to be sure it's safe to charge the battery with this docking station. I should probably get one of the Dell Docs; however, I live outside of the country and getting one of them is impossible. Thanks again.[–]The-Scotsman_9510 | 4K | i7 | 16GB | 512GB 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)It'll still charge, but at a lower voltage. Won't do the battery any good long term.The dock obviusly can't provide the required power for the laptop, despite using your laptop's charger.The dock will have a maximum power output, you should check that against what the laptop needs.\n",

If you are the original owner and you plan to be in the country that you are in for more than 6 months I would fill out a Change of ownership form.

      "content: i have a dell inspiron 5580 purchased in 2019. this has i7-8565 processor, 24gb ram and 2tb hdd. some months back i got fitted a samsung ssd 970 evo plus 250gb as the computer was quite slow. i cloned my c: drive to it and the laptop has been working very well. however i have noticed that the hdd has got pretty noisy since i fitted the hdd. it is silent at times but at most times there is a continuous hum. the hdd health is good so i wonder if this is due to the ssd accessing the data on the hdd faster than it is used to. is there any solution to this problem or should i replace the hdd with a sata ssd of 2tb? the 2tb ssd's are quite expensive but the continuous humming is also disturbing. will this ssd work, https://www.amazon.in/2-5-inch-internal-solid-state-wds200t2b0a/dp/b073sbrhh6, or would it not be compatible?\n",

First question: do you know if, when you connect an external display via Thunderbolt, it goes to the iGPU or the Nvidia dGPU?[–]thestrongcyberuserInspiron 16 Plus 7620 w/ Nvidia 3060 Graphics 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(5 children)I'll be honest with you.  I never had the chance to try connecting a display to the Thunderbolt port, BUT I am going to assume that it uses the dGPU because if you plug in a monitor from the HDMI port, it starts using the Nvidia GPU exclusively. I'm planning to purchase a WD22TB4 docking station, so it will be interesting to see if it uses the dGPU.[–]tropeenthusiast212[S,🍰] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(4 children)Oh please let me know how it goes, I'm considering exactly that kind of setup!

In the entry it matches there is this text:\"Check if the display cable (EDP) is seated properly or pinched at the hinges.

If you have 1 DIMM then it's simple really: get a replacement.The online Support Manualhttps://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/inspiron-15-7580-laptop/inspiron-7580-setup-and-specifications/memory?guid=guid-9cd6d69d-68a5-4054-8c0e-e3966f67bdc4&lang=en-usstates your machine has 2 SO-DIMM slots which accept DDR4 RAM which is rated for 2400-2666MHz so that's what you would shop for.FWIW, I believe your machine is from about 2018 so you might want to consider this as an opportunity to upgrade to a newer machine (or not, it's up to you).\n",

You can go to that device properties and get the hardware id that you originally asked for.  However, the fact that it shows up there without any error means that it should be working within Windows already.  There *shouldn't* be any further drivers required... generally those just simply work.  Although, obviously there is something causing yours not to work.I assume that you have checked the Windows control panel settings for the touchscreen to make sure that the settings have not gotten disabled somehow for that.  Also, and I have seen this before myself... there is a setting that will disable a mouse if another mouse is plugged in.  Sometimes, Windows gets mixed up with the touchscreen and touchpad, seeing them as a mouse and/or touchpad, and will disable one or the other due to the other one being present.  There is a setting in the control panel for that, to turn that feature on/off.  Turn that setting off, and just see what happens.  At least that will either fix it or it will eliminate that as the issue, one way or the other... because everything in your picture looks good.[–]justalonelychild44[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Yes, the touchpad is working.

      "content of comments: (3 children)If you have replaced the hard drive, clean reinstalled windows, tried ubuntu, and installed all updates including bios, then this is a hardware issue.  Probably something that would be difficult or impossible to fix (other than replacing the motherboard).[–]walidfen[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(2 children)I saw a video on YouTube. The guy removed VLC and his dell worked just fine. I tried and it seems to be working I donno how and why. I'll test it for some days and see the results[–]this_is_me_it_is 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(1 child)Your original post indicates that this happens when doing things that are not related to VLC.  VLC doesn't have any affect on the system when it isn't running.[–]walidfen[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Yes. It happens randomly without opening vlc. How did the trick work ? I don't really know[–]Mind_Matters_Most 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Thermal Paste needs to be replaced. If it's never been changed, there's no heat exchange between the CPU/GPU and the heat pipe. The CPU/GPU is probably thermal limited due to excessive heat.The other thing you can try, not sure, is to go into the BIOS and hit reset bios to factory default.[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago(0 children)Try running this: How to Run a Preboot Diagnostic Test on a Dell ComputerIf you have a hardware problem, that test should find it and tell you what it is.\n",

      "content: hi everyone my dell inspiron 15 ( series 3000 bought in 2015 ) keeps freezing for no apparent reason. i tried installing a new ssd instead of the old hdd and installing a new windows 10 and the problem persists. tried with ubuntu and it isn't solved. it freezes on random things, like watching youtube / a movie on vlc and even when simply clicking on the desktop. the screen just stop reacting and the mouse freezes for 5 to 30 seconds. i can't buy a new laptop for now and i need it for my daily use and studies is there any possible solution ? ( hardware or software ) thanks\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)Anything with USB A involved won't work. Plain old USB is a 5V standard. USB-PD for charging items like laptops over USB-C ports goes up to 20V and is much more complex.You need a USB-PD capable charger with a USB-C to USB-C cable rated for the appropriate power level (e.g. 100W).[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago(0 children)The barrel charger can be 45W or 65W so your USB-C based charger should be the same. Your laptop should connect to the charger using a male C to male C cable (unless the charger has something other than a female C port).The power adapter specs in the online manual:https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/vostro-13-5301-laptop/vostro5301_ss/power-adapter?guid=guid-88ad9930-8170-4253-b304-ac0b3a04d93e&lang=en-usI wouldn't connect your laptop to an unknown USB port in a public place. You don't know if it will cause problems or damage. Your laptop is important to you so don't risk it.HTH.\n",

I've read many times that Corsair RAM does not work in Dell PCs. Crucial branded RAM usually works.

You would then put the HDD into a SATA-to-USB enclosure and plug that into the computer. Your HDD will then appear in the other computer's file navigator (eg, Windows File Explorer, macOS Finder, etc.) and you can then copy the files on it to another drive for backup, etc.If you use another Windows PC, you might have to override the security settings on the various folders on the HDD to be able to get into those folders; if you use something like a Mac or Linux PC, it probably won't have security access issues.HTH.[–]PrimaryCombination26[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago(3 children)SATA-to-USB enclosureIs the enclosure (ie physical case) critical here, is that simulating something, or will an SATA-to-USB adapter suffice?

      "content: -------cpu issues-------- i7-1165g7. it's a 11th gen i7, sounds pretty powerful right? intel specified it at 28w. the chip scores 2800 on cpu-z. (which is kinda meh, that's the speed of a desktop 9th gen i5, but it's understanble since its a low-power ultrabook solution.) dell capped it at 18.7w, so that made it the same speed of a 6th gen desktop i7. even with the cap, if i kept running the stress test it would eventually fall to 1100 points on cpu-z stress, making it the same speed of a i3-4130. i managed to set the tdp limit to 28w using project-sbc on github, but it immediately jumps to 92⁰c (prochot) and falls from 28 to 18w within 20 seconds. then it keeps going down and down. -------nvidia gpu issues-------- the mx330 is capped to a 67⁰c limit, when it reaches that temp, it falls back to 139mhz which is the lowest 3d resolution for it. (stock is 1700mhz) so if i tried to play a game, it would immediately throttle from 20-30 fps to 2-5 fps. also, sometimes i would reach past that without even using the gpu, it averaged around 72⁰c with only discord open, because of the heat from the cpu going to the gpu. that means if i open a game it would run at 139mhz until it cools down (never) i managed to increase the limit using asus gpu tweak ii, i cranked it to the default 94⁰c nvidia puts on it, when it reaches around 87⁰c, the laptop all of a sudden shuts down, due to the vrm overheating. i could get it stable with 84⁰c limit. the cpu throttles even worse if i'm using the gpu with the 84⁰c limit. the cpu throttles to 1100mhz sometimes. (max frequency is 4700mhz) that makes it run with the same speed of a i5-4200u from 2013. i could disable the mx330 and keep only the iris xe which surprisingly is better than the mx330 in core speed. but there is a problem, everything i talked here was with the laptop plugged in, when i unplug it, the cpu runs at the 28w limit i set under stress for some seconds and then falls to a 14w limit (not a hardware limitation, it's a dell thing they put to limit usage on battery) (i couldn't manage to get around that one) the problem is, the iris shares the same tdp with the cpu core, so if both are being used, you get roughly 6w for the cpu and 6w for the iris on battery, and the rest goes to cpu dram and other stuff. and 6w for the cpu makes windows extremely laggy and impossible to use. so yeah, don't buy dell ultrabooks with poor cooling and mx graphics cards.\n",

To run the diagnostics, restart the machine and press and hold F12 when the Dell logo appears. A menu should appear. You should select the diagnostics option on it to run the diagnostics.If nothing is found to be faulty, you can probably continue to use the machine but be more wary if the lights continue. If the frequency of the problem increases, it's best to run the diagnostics again.As you get towards the end of your warranty period, re-assess whether you want to send the machine back for Dell to examine/service it. Once the warranty expires, fixing the problem could become, err, difficult.As for the software/visual glitching, I'm not sure what's causing that and whether it's related to your amber/white light display. Maybe others have an idea as to what's going on?HTH.[–]litetaker[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Diagnostics does not show any issues. Says all tests passed.

      "content: hello, i have a dell vostro 5320 laptop that i purchased in the uk. it has an i5-1240p processor, 16 gb of ddr5 ram, a 1920x1200 lcd panel. it is running windows 11 pro 22h2 (os build is 22621.819) there is no major issue with my laptop or its lcd screen, and the hardware works fine. however, i still see the \"2 amber and 7 white led\" flashing pattern on the charging led indicator every now and then. this happens despite the lcd functioning perfectly fine. when i googled the meaning of this led error pattern, the information i got was that this indicates a faulty/non-functioning lcd panel. and all the posts i found online mention that the lcd panel is not working or turning on. but my lcd panel works fine though. i also noticed that this flashing led pattern clears up after i shut down and turn on the laptop (i.e. do a complete power cycle rather than simply restarting it). here is a video i posted on youtube to demonstrate what is going on with my laptop: youtube video is there some issue with my laptop that needs to be addressed or can i ignore this flashing led pattern? the only issue i have noticed with the display seems to be a software/graphics driver issue in windows 11 rather than any hardware issue. i noticed that after using my laptop for sometime (over the course of several days, after hibernating and resuming etc) dragging and moving windows in the os only shows a rectangular outline of the window rather than showing the contents. and the maximise/minimise animation of the windows does not show. this makes it look like something turned off several features in the graphics settings on windows. and the issue resolves itself after restarting the laptop. note that this happens on both external monitors and on the built-in lcd display. and this is definitely a software issue and not related to the flashing led light error code.\n",

If the driver is an update, you can often use the Roll Back Driver button to restore the previous version. This is often quicker/easier than trying to find and install the driver from a website.To open Device Manager, type Windows-R (hold down Windows key and type R) then enter devmgmt.msc into the text field and press enter. The Device Manager will open. Your cirrus driver will be associated with either/or a device in the \"Audio inputs and outputs\" section or the \"Sound, video and game controllers\" section.When you locate the device, select it and right-click on it and select Properties. In the window that opens, click on the Driver tab and then click the Roll Back Driver button (if it allows you to do that).If this does not work or cannot be done, go to Dell Support, click This PC, click \"Drivers & Downloads\", then click \"Find drivers\" in the \"Manually find a specific driver\" section. In the Category box, click Audio. That should display the available drivers from which you can download the version you want.HTH.[–]Chill_Out18[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(2 children)I have done all of that and it's not working. On Dell website there's two options, high Def audio driver and cirrus logic. On the first one, everything seems to be in order but there's no sound reproduced at all. On the latter it works as described in the post :/[–]parasymchills 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Sounds like something is messed up in the Windows installation.If you have a spare SSD/HDD, you could try clean installing Windows on it and then install all of the drivers from the Dell Support website. After doing that, you should have a system that outputs audio correctly. If that is the case, you could then inspect it and see what versions of the drivers are on the \"good\" installation and try to alter your current OS to match it. This might not succeed if your current OS is too messed up (sad but it does happen).If it does not work out, you could always migrate your daily OS to your new OS installation (although that's quite a bit of work usually so you would do this as a last resort).Alternatively, you could try the \"Reset this PC\" option in Windows recovery, but it also might not work and would require the re-installation of apps.Best of luck and HTH.[–]Chill_Out18[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(0 children)That's what's baffling me because I've used the same installation as before when I had no issues.. I'll probably have to try to clean install it again since I don't have a spare drive. But I appreciate the help\n",

      "content of comments: (2 children)There are 2 things I think you should do:​To generate a battery health report, open a Terminal window and copy/paste this into it:powercfg /BATTERYREPORTand then press the enter key. That will create a report file. In the same Terminal window, copy/paste this into it:explorer battery-report.htmland then press enter. Use this if the previous line did not work:explorer %USERPROFILE%\\battery-report.htmland then press enter. The report will open in your web browser. You should be able to read it to find out what the battery's condition is.Near the top of the report under the Installed batteries section there will be some lines of \"DESIGN CAPACITY\", \"FULL CHARGE CAPACITY\" and \"CYCLE COUNT\". They will give you an indication of the health of the battery. Further down in the report is a recent history of the power/battery state.​To run diagnostics, restart the PC and when the Dell logo appears, press the F12 key to bring up the boot menu. Select the diagnostics option and let the diagnostics run to completion. If there is a problem detected, use the error code or QR code to organize a repair. It sounds like the machine is still under warranty so it should not cost you anything except time. If it needs repairing, back up your files in case something unforeseen occurs.FWIW, if it is the battery that has failed and the diagnostics says so, it should be replaced under warranty. This happened to my first battery 3 months after I got the machine and I got it replaced under warranty without charge to me.HTH.[–]Skylereer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago(1 child)Hi!

On the other hand the battery appears swollen.  Perhaps  change it now while the case is open.[–]Big_Jomez[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(4 children)Oh shit, is it swollen?? Well, after all my trouble I manged to fuck up at the end. Was getting to the last screw on the DC port to switch it out with a new one (my goal), and I ended up stripping the screw. Closed everything back up and now I'm just gonna take it to the local repair shop. Guess I can ask em to switch out the battery while they're at it. Do all batteries eventually swell, or was it from misuse?So just googled swollen battery and it seems to be very very light swelling, if any. But idk I'm no expert[–]TerrorToadx 5 points6 points7 points 3 months ago(3 children)Don't listen to him, it's not swollen.[–]Big_Jomez[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(2 children)I was going to double check in the shop.

You can easily find battery replacements on amazon or ebay.  No need to go to the shop.Try to go for Dell branded as opposed to generic.[–]GUNGHO917 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(0 children)It doesn’t look swollen.  If anything, it looks like excess wrapping around the battery that makes it bulge in places.  The wrap won’t always be perfect.  If the thing balloons and things like your touchpad raises, or, the bottom cover is pressed out (also making it difficult to fasten the screws back onto the cover), u likely have a swollen battery.[–]Ashamed-External-515 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago*(5 children)Unfortunate  mishap on stripping the screw.  I don't know if all batteries swell but there is about a max 5 year lifespan before  they start to not hold a charge.  You are correct, the swelling is minor but if it gets much worse it can put pressure on the keyboard or the touch pad and cause damage to them. You can expect to see quick battery discharge occurring sometime soon.  So yes, have it replaced.Edit:  You didn't  do anything wrong to cause the swelling, if it is swollen.  I am no expert either.  Just going by stuff I have read.Is the DC port physically broken or is the laptop not charging?  Could be a dead battery if it isn't  charging.[–]Big_Jomez[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 months ago(4 children)Yeah...im so salty because I was so close on getting it done but I had to mess up the last step. Eh, I'm sure the local repair shop can handle all my issues.It's charging, by I have to contort the ac adapter for it to work. And no, it's not the adapter because I tried another perfectly functional one and it had the same issue.That makes sense since my laptops going on its 4th+ year.

      "content: hi all, we have a dell vostro 7510 with an intel core i7-11800h and geforce rtx 3050 ti graphics, loaded with windows 11. bought it in late june, and since new it has been making an intermittent popping sound through both its built-in speakers or through headphones. it's the sort of sound you'd expect when plugging some headphones into a jack while you're wearing them, or when a sound card resumes from sleep / power saving mode. however, the popping even happens while the laptop has been continuously playing music or a movie for a while. we've also tried playing our streaming video through different web browsers, or playing a local file through vlc and we get the same result. we have noted that it seems to happen more often when there's some network activity after a long idle period. we have tried it with wifi and wired ethernet (through a usb hub) and it still happens (even with the wifi card disabled), so we don't think that's the cause. we've updated to all the latest drivers, applied every os and bios update available, and we've even just had the motherboard changed by a dell technician, but it's still happening. i was thinking it could be a power supply issue, but we've just changed the motherboard and i believe the power supply unit is on the board itself? i guess what i'd like to know is - is anyone else experiencing this issue? the actual popping itself doesn't bother me that much, but i'm worried that it might be some other underlying issue. for example, i had a dell g7 7588 gaming laptop that had similar sound popping issues (much more severe, and happened every time it played audio after a long idle period). this was eventually fixed by a software update, but the laptop itself had a long history of random technical issues until it finally died due to a power supply issue, where it would not charge its battery. if the problem is widespread, i guess it's probably: a) a software / driver issue that will be fixed eventually. or... b) there's a high incidence rate of faulty components on the vostro 7510 series, so even a replacement motherboard may have the same issue. thanks in advance for any help / insight.\n",

Do you have a power strip or UPS protecting the Vostro?[–]verywellwhatnow[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(6 children)I live in Poland, Central-Eastern Europe, however we do not experience (hardly) any power outages or fluctuations. I do not use a UPS - would that help? What i also thought about is that this alternating sound could be caused by different power needs of the computer, depending on the process the CPU is currently dealing with. Could that be the reason maybe?[–]hayabusafiend 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(5 children)A UPS, or at least a power conditioning power strip, is good to protect your equipment (TV, PCs, stereo, etc).  Power brownouts, outages, and spikes can damage power supplies.  Some types of large power supplies will change (transformer vibration) pitch depending on the wall input voltage.  A UPS won’t eliminate the sound, but will make it a consistent frequency.As for the noise, it shouldn’t be buzzing.  You said the buzzing “alternates”.  On/off?  Pitch?  How often does the sound change and does that match anything the PC is doing?[–]verywellwhatnow[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(4 children)It is always there and it seems to correlate with the CPU usage. When I open an application or a couple of them at the same time the pitch of the buzzing gets higher and after that it subsides, but it stays there. I was thinking that maybe the power supply`s fan could be adjusting to the current power usage of the pc`s components making it more energy efficient, but then still the sound is pretty annoying and i cannot recall hearing such a sound working on older hardware or not so long ago on a regular-sized pc with a 500W power supply.[–]hayabusafiend 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(3 children)Where do you hear the noise?  Is it coming thru the 3.5mm analog headset?Pitch changing with CPU usage is more likely a cooling fan or RF (radio) noise you would hear in the 3.5mm analog jack.Gently open the case and move your head over each component:  CPU fan, power supply, hard drive(?).\n",

      "content of comments: (3 children)Inspiron is the low end consumer laptop, with the lowest build quality but a range of performance options. If your decision is based on price look here. XPS is the high end consumer laptop, designed to look sleek and compete in the MacBook Pro space (though, not without faults). If money is no object look here. Vostro is the low end business laptop. Better quality than Inspiron and decent performance but not really a great gaming rig. If money is important but balanced with reliability and support needs, consider these. Latitude is a more robust, everyday business laptop. No good gaming options. If you need to equip 100 staff at your office, buy these. Precision is the high end business workstation, with the best quality and support of all and max performance. If money is no object and you need a computational beast that will run for 10 years, buy this.[–]daegou[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(2 children)Thankyou so much!!

They do tend to run hot (you'll want to replace the abysmal thermal compound), and some of the components are cheaper quality, but in many ways are just as good as an XPS.[–]daegou[S] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(0 children)Got it, tysm 🙏🏼\n",

Some ultra low power crap with only 2 real cores which is not acceptable in 2022.) Are targeted clearly towards gaming with all the quality problems. Also I cant justify buying laptops for business use having \"gaming\" in the name..) Out of budget starting at 2K+ for XPS/Precision.) Have poor ST performance (AMD).) Are last Intel gen.) Not available to business customers (Lenovo Thinkbook 16 G4)​So far the onpy decent options seem to be:.) Vostro 5620 (heard about heating issues, dont know if this is still a problem).) Vostro 7620.) Maybe Lenovo Thinkbook 15 G4 when it becomes available[–]lokujj 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(2 children)Something that concerns me about the Vostro 7620 is that it only has a single RAM upgrade slot, and that is coupled with 8GB integrated memory. What I'm wondering is if that integrated RAM locks you into using Dell RAM in the SODIMM slot, which would significantly influence the cost of upgrades.For example, it looks like a 32GB @ 4800 MHz stick of Crucial RAM runs around $200, but the most comparable thing available from Dell around is $500.Anyone understand this, and able to comment?[–]HootersMcBoobies 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(1 child)Yea I was looking at that. I'm considering getting one of those $200 32GB DDR5 SODIMMS + the 7620. I'm currently using an X1 Carbon 11th gen for work and they are SLOOOOW. The 11th gen chip is truly a waste of sand and the thing is so \"thin and lite\" that is constantly throttles. It's not unusable, but it's laggy and my Dell XPS 15/i9 from my last job was sadly way better (and I am not a fan of XPSes .. lots of quality control and thermal issues).[–]lokujj 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago(0 children)I'm considering getting one of those $200 32GB DDR5 SODIMMS + the 7620If you do this, I will be curious how well it works.

Be careful removing the old CPU, ground yourself to avoid any static shock, and apply thermal compound (not too much!) and check that the heat sink is snug before you turn it back on.[–]InvertedKite[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(2 children)Thanks for the reply.

      "You can help keep it cooler by proping the back of the laptop up so it can suck more air though the bottom.Or 2 if you want to risk opening it, get some better thermal paste.It is surprising that it's thermal throttling with just a CPU.

Are you mistaking it for power saving modes?If it had a Nvidia GPU then sure I can understand it gets hot.[–]Thin-Gene617[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago(3 children)Thanks for the reply, I figured it out.Dell gimps the firmware on everything that isn't an XPS or a Latitude to make sure they don't get issues before warranty expires and to make sure the cheaper laptops don't perform as well.Even Latitude 5xx1/Precision 35x1 series (Intel H series instead of U series) are gimped by locking TDP to 35W instead of default 45W to prevent cutting sales from the Precision 5000/7000 lineups. The 14inchers are understandable but even the 15 inch with a bigger heatsink (unlike Lenovo Dell does not reuse same motherboard/heatsink across different models with different chassis) are locked to the same and tools like XTU/Throttlestop cannot remove the limitI am returning this piece of shit immediately.[–]richkill 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(2 children)Let us know how the return goes.[–]Thin-Gene617[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago(1 child)I had to struggle for two hours with indian phone operatives before they finally accepted the return. Some of them were very nice and it's the only reason I got through.Another handy Dell scam is despite advertising on the actual product page as I was buying that it came with \"EZ-returns\" meaning you could ship it back without paying a fee or providing proofs, it apparently does not apply to the Vostro line because they're business laptops.Beyond me why they'd have such blatant false advertising. Because of that I had to go through the tech support department and convince them that something is wrong before they authorized the return and transferred me to the customer care department.So overall false advertising on the performance and false advertising on the return policy. Personally I'm done dealing with this company forever, I'm just glad I was able to get my money back.[–]richkill 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)Good to hear.

I use darkroom for editing so not sure what exactly is the difference performance wise to Lightoom. Overall I think its decent for what I ask it.I'm not sure of the difference between the 12thgen intel and ryzen 5000 chips but I would assume the intel is faster as it is newer. So unless you go super heavy with your edits I dont think you could go wrong with your choices.[–]litetaker[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)Thanks for the reply. I was considering the Inspiron 14 with the Ryzen 5700U CPU a few months ago. But what I noticed is that the iGPU in the AMD processor is weak and unable to play 4K 60Hz HDR videos on YouTube when I connected the laptop to my 4K HDR monitor. Therefore, after doing a lot of research, I decided to not go for the AMD CPU as it struggles with high quality videos unfortunately. I tried an older 11th gen Intel laptop at a store, and it was able to play 4K 60Hz HDR videos on YouTube just fine. And since the iGPU on the 11th gen and 12th gen Intel CPUs are the same, I thought an Intel laptop is probably a better choice for my use case. So I think the Inspiron 14 with a i7-1255U will be enough for me.[–]Falcon007_rb 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago(0 children)Idk man I usually tell people to stay away from dell because their customer service is non existent near my area...

Save the laptop cash and buy a desktop + iPad (or similar).[–]litetaker[S] 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)I like the flexibility of a laptop, as I can take it with me elsewhere and have all my stuff in it. An iPad or another tablet is not going to be the same as a full fledged laptop with a desktop OS on it. I already have a tablet and it is nice, but a thin and light laptop would be better. I am not going to buy a very expensive laptop with a powerful GPU, the laptops I mentioned in my post only have iGPUs. And I used my current laptop for 7+ years so I don't think laptops necessarily get obsolete in just 3 years.

      "Is it still like this?[–]beanimus0829 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(3 children)Right around there. I've noticed a difference between when I use standard charger and my generic 100w type C. I also get a warning in the bios when I use it. Obviously battery life will vary depending on what you are doing as well.  3 months would be pretty early to see battery decay. I just think they kept it super thin and could have gone a bit thicker and put a bigger battery.[–][deleted] 8 months ago(2 children)[deleted][–]beanimus0829 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(1 child)I really enjoy it still. No problems with larger spreadsheets with vlookups and logic statements. 3D modeling im not really sure as I’ve only goofed around with basic shapes for 3D printing. I can say with the original charger i got borderlands 3 to play at 60Fps on high settings but my ram use was showing in the 12GB range. I believe this is due to the 4GB of VRam not being enough and overflowing to my ddr4. If 3D modeling also has the ability to use standard ram, it may be affected more by how much ram your program also uses. Overall i think a great computer, but you do see wild variances in battery life. For me it seems to drain more while idle as opposed to working.  I see it last anywhere from 3 hours to 8 hours.[–]SumolizerVostro 7500 - i7 10750H - 16 GB DDR4 - GTX 1650Ti GDDR6 - 512 GB 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(0 children)i got a high end Vostro 15 7500 ( i7-10750H/1650ti/16 gigs ram and 2 Nvme ssds )Its slim and smart and looks very classy the keyboard is good.

Vostro is a \"small business\" Inspirion. There's W2Best on YT who had several problems with this Vostro/Inspiron. This was a year or two ago and he reviews the new 16\" Inspirion.[–]taylofox 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(1 child)I understand that vostro is better than inspiron in Dell ranges, where from worst to best it would be something like: inspiron, vostro, latitude, xps[–]Arcane_Logic 0 points1 point2 points 7 months ago(0 children)Actually, that is inaccurate. XPS: These are usually attractive machines, with high-end components. But, they can sacrifice \"Form over Function\". Hence, they are not as robust, and sturdy as Latitude's. Latitude: Dell's best business machines. These do not look as stylish, as the XPS line. But they are full of substance. They usually have good, to great specs. These are designed for business employees, who can be careless, clumsy, etc. Therefore, they are built more solid, than the XPS line.[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(0 children)I'm not familiar with Vostro but I'm a big fan of the big business computer lines like Latitude, ThinkPad, Elitebook.You spend a bit more for the performance than others but you get a machine that's durable and meant to be relatively easily repaired by in-house IT and tend to have more parts available. But honestly, you gotta do what you gotta do.[–]ashdrewness 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(0 children)Vostro is basically a re-skinned Inspiron[–]TerrorToadx 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(0 children)They're cheap business laptops aimed for small business who don't have the budget for the Latitudes. Doesn't mean they're gonna break after a month of usage, but worse build quality for sure.[–]DiwagarV 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(0 children)Vostro series is a budget series and if you cant afford any other series, nothing wrong in going with Vostro. Latitude is business series and I don't know who suggested that for a student. Instead look into Inspiron series which is the mid range for general home users. Among the series, few set of configurations and build quality differs. For eg: Latitude series doesn't come with dedicated GPU. Irrespective of the series you choose, try to pick the right hardware configuration, else PC wont perform well as expected.[–]transplant_west 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago*(4 children)I got my vostro 5620 (on a GREAT sale) last week.... it rocks honestly... my only complaint is the max sound is tooo low.

Really impressive speed and battery.The only thing I dislike is Windows 11. It's just Win 10 with an appalling theme and no logic, and 2-3 times more steps to get to the same place.And price was incredible: $550 from the Dell site in europe.[–]Cavehomme 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago(0 children)You've no doubt made your purchase decision already, but for anyone else asking the same question, here's my own experience.I've used Vostro and Latitude laptops for many years, also HP, Lenovo, Thinkpad, Toshiba, Asus, Apple. I keep coming back to Dell because they are very well designed, and well built, excellent pricing, and they do what I need for business, and for my pastimes. I've acutally just bought in the Black Friday sales a new Vostro 5625 with a Ryzen 7 CPU and graphics and did some speed tests against a 2 year old Thinkpad with Intel 10 series -i7 CPU. The Vostro blew it away. It wasn't just a bit faster, it was 4 times faster on running some very long and complicated Excel macros! Very happy with it, and like the deeper / higher 1900 x 1200 screen compared to the too wide Thinkpad and most other laptop screens sold today. It also gives me a full 4K at 60 HZ on my large desktop monitor which I use for graphics.I highly recommend the Vostro for small businesses, professionals and students.\n",

The 2g volume is more than enough.Clean the heatsink and CPU carefully and thoroughly with strips of coffee filter paper and alcohol. Take your time; doesn't take long; but do it right the first time and you'll never have to do it again.Tip for applying - you really do not need a lot of paste, just 2/3 small drops for the CPU and 1/2 drops for the GPU. Then just use your finger wearing a surgical glove or any flat, clear plastic implement to squish it down lightly - this is better than a spatula. Touch up any small area that isn't covered and repeat. It is better to have a bit more paste and no air gaps than too little.When screwing the heatsink back, line up the fan in the hole, then screw down the numbered screws 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 (opposite corners) about 3 turns at a time until done. Then plug the fan back in.[–]mad_programmer_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 12 months ago(3 children)Thanks a lot. I ordered MX4.

(i probably just dated myself). the win10 key is only valid for win10 and not for win11. so there goes saving a step by skipping 10 and installing 11. i guess my question is solved so i will leave this up for posterity.\n",

It was the screw on the right side middle. I was able to force it out eventually , but it stripped the head and I had to replace that screw. Once it was off I noticed the hole on the bottom of the case panel and the hole it threads into on the computer didn’t 100% align. You might be able to apply a little gentle downward pressure on the case around the screw while turning it, as long as it’s one of those middle screws on the left or right. I also remember having to give a little downward pressure on the screw driver while turning the stuck screw. But again, be gentle if you try that.Edit: more info.[–]usafle[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago(3 children)Took it to a local computer shop (not Greek squad) and took them all of two seconds with a \"specialized screwdriver\" \n",

      "content of comments: (8 children)It's might sound pretty dumb, but try removing all SSDs and power up the laptop (give at least 3 mins to allow showing the DELL logo).Note that when replacing a Dell laptop's components, the BIOS takes some time to do a checksum. It happened to me when I added a RAM stick and it took forever to boot... it was the BIOS doing the checksum. I freaked out and thought laptop was dead... it was just taking time adjusting the new hardware configuration.It is pretty hard to brick a laptop just by placing a new (extra or not) SSD. In my opinion it should boot without SSD and leave it on for a while. If it does not boot by any means, just send it to RMA/Warranty.Edit: does fan spin full speed while on?[–]heschlah[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(7 children)Thanks a lot for your help.I first removed both SSDs and then also the RAM sticks but the screen is still dark except for the keyboard light.

If not, it will be stuck in a loop.You can try the CMOS battery but I believe won't change a thing.

Better than most Macs I ever had and that's since the 1990s. PC business laptops are a far cry from consumer models. Like they are built by different companies.[–]heschlah[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(2 children)That's why I chose the Dell Vostro - I expected business quality. But in reality it's just a rebranded Inspiron.. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago*(1 child)W2Best on YT has done a lot of videos on Vostro, but called Inspiron where he is in Europe. He's got the new 16\" in a new video. I almost got one because it's an the \"small business\" section, but the dark color and the dedicated graphics. He had the 15.6 a year or two ago and has several videos on that one as well.I have 2 Latitudes. I bought them based on using them at work. My Macs crapped out so I thought I'd try Latitude. There's a German guy who did a comparison of a Dell Latitude 7450 and a MacBook Pro. I ended up getting a refurbished one from Dell for cheap and it was wonderful. Then got a newer model and its been wonderful (Windows 11 is running perfect on it, had some issues with W10).I have a consumer G5 SE gaming laptop and its nice, but yeah, nowhere like the Latitude.Considered a 17\" Inspiron, love those big laptops, but feel the HP Envy is a little nice (and the aspect ratio I prefer 16:9). Don't have one yet.So after 15 years of using Mac and Latitude, the Latitudes have been rock solid and the Macs have had the issues...like paint coming off the keys, logic board problems, failing screens ($$$) and the keyboard problems. People put Apple up on a pedestal. I certainly and blindly used to do that. I have 3 MacBooks sitting here that failed...in the last 10 years...never again...My last Mac, MacBook 12 crapped out. $1500 down the toilet. The keyboard problem, before Apple had their repair program. Screen crapped out just after a year, paint came off the keys. An amazing laptop with just problems. Another Mac, 2016 MBP keyboard failures (fixed after Apple wanted to just spray air under the keyboard...) then the screen went out just after a year...that's a $550 fix...\n",

      "content: hi everyone! i recently bought a new in box dell vostro 7500. it is equipped with an i5-10300h, a geforce gtx 1650 ti (4gb), a soldered 1x8gb 2933mhz ram (it has one extra dimm slot fortunatelly), and an adata 256gb ssd. after reading some posts (after buying it) i noticed that many people complain about overheating and aslo laptop media claims its great potential is hindered by poor cooling, i decided to understand better the cooling solution and what can be improved. first impressions air intake comes from the bottom, but the exhaust is not sides or back like regular laptops, but pointing right to the screen. odd desing given the \"gaming\" capabilities of it. air intake exhaust i also noticed that even though 'dell update' states everything is up to date, there were plenty of windows optional updates (driver-related). but before updating i ran a test and found out that my cpu and ssd were underperforming (based on userbenchmark.net). then i updated the drivers and now everything's working as expected. easy fix if you don't want to open the laptop. internals i've decided to open the laptop to look into the cooling solution and inspect the thermal compound. i found it very weird that the gpu thermal paste looked dried-up since the cpu one looks perfectly fine (fresh). back of laptop without the cover back of laptop without the cover and after heatsink removal. ​ close up of thermal paste residue, is the gpu one dried-up? gpu thermal paste def. dried solution approach i've decided i should go with a new thermal paste, and picked up one of the best non-conductive one (price-wisey) which was thermal grizzly kryonaut. so i ran some tests with the stock thermal paste, and also using a cooling pad. unfortunatelly i did not perform a 100% use of cpu and/or gpu on stock since i was unsure on how to perform them. thermal grizzly kryonaut ($9 the gram) new thermal paste application tests i did some gaming on high (fortnite) for 20mins to see the difference and also checked temperatures on idle. to pick up the temperatures i used the open hardware monitor tool, with a sample of 10 seconds. then took the average of the samples and placed them in a bar-chart. results cpu on idle (in cº) cpu while gaming (in cº) gpu on idle (in cº) gpu while gaming (in cº) the new thermal compound outperforms the stock one on gaming because: cpu temp was reduced 6.7% (5° celsius) gpu temp was reduced 17% (8° celsius) it's impressive how the thermal grizzly compound was much more efficient than the stock one. i believe it was because it dried up due to incorrect application: there was a big gap between the gpu and the heatsink and it dried very fast. note that on idle, the improvement was not noticeable, i believe this is due cpu and gpu fans were powered off due to inactivity/low temp. i think this also impacted the temperatures while using the cooling pad which did not help at all on idle. thoughts even though the new thermal compound outperforms the stock one, since the cpu and gpu share the same cooling system, while cooling down the gpu with the new thermal paste, it also helped the overall heatpipe temperature. ​ disclaimer: please don't dyi if you have never opened a laptop before. take it to the technician to perform above steps.\n",

My absolute need is a powerful Intel CPU that doesn't thermal throttles since it will be under load while doing work, GPU is not of my concern since I'm not into gaming, nor I do intense graphic stuff.I will not use it unplugged at all, and would not use it on my lap ever, most of the time I'll plug it to a second monitor either at home or in the studio.Other options in my region at this price point and this configurations are Acer Nitro 5, Dell G15, Inspirion Plus and Asus TUF F17, which I liked because it's a 17'' but I read some horror stories here. Originally, I wanted to get Legion 5, but at this moment I can't find them in my region at all.Please help.Thanks[–]JayAbbhi[S] 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago(12 children)Laptop media has a review for this thing out here https://laptopmedia.com/review/dell-vostro-15-7510/Personally, i'd go with the maxed out config since it's only $200 more than the base config, and you get a lot more for your money, that is of you want a game a lil bit on the side.

You could always go down to a lower performance profile, since Dell's software will actually change the fan speed curves and wattage based on the performance profiles.[–]alonzo86 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago(8 children)I was under impression that cooling pads don't really work, but I will get one if they could keep the CPU temps under control. Asus TUF F17 17'' is the least expensive for me, but I'm really afraid to get that one lol, if I knew it won't have problems plus cooling pad I would get it right away.\n",

It's been a while since I've been buying a computer with my  own money, so am somewhat out of the loop regarding AMD vs Intel. The AMD has a lower on paper TDP which I guess would translate into lower power consumption, but not sure how that translates into real world usage.Your insight regarding \"AMD processors are known for equivalent or better performance at lower power consumption\" lines up with both the above, and other reports I've read. The question is, by how much.[–]FreshlyCleanedLinens 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago*(2 children)Maybe this will help?Seems like a pretty significant battery life improvement, plus you will benefit from more cores, depending on the processor.Edit: Also don’t forget about power consumption’s effect on thermals, which isn’t insignificant given the limited heat dissipation on these thin and light laptops.[–]mvdw73[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago*(1 child)Thanks, that was exactly the kind of data I was looking for.

I have the non-to 3050. Erosion of your machine, everything else looks the same. I struggle to get 4-4 1/2 hrs battery on Win11, after a clean install and using iGPU. That’s doing light tasks like just browsing.I usually get about 3.5 hours. Getting it to 4.5 is with a lot of effort and using every power saving method I can think of.Linux I can’t get it to deep sleep properly on suspend, so the battery usually dies overnight when I suspend instead of shutdown.Side note, Dell part DVG8M 86wh battery I was told by dell works with this.

Biggest thing is memory and storage. If you have to work with VMs a lot then maybe go with a 1TB SSD as they get chunky. Also applies if they want you to use lots of IDEs and stuff. Android Studio, IntelliJ, and Verilog take up a good chunk of space. Other than that, everything else is solid.[–]cojerk 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(1 child)Its been many years since I've got my CS degree.  But I would wonder now, would a good recommendation be multiple cores for experimentation with multithreaded development?  I know almost all CPUs have them these days, but is there a recommendation to push for more if able?[–]J_Money99 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)I think the shift from single threaded to multi-threaded is the biggest hurdle. Anything after that is just repeating what is already done from 1 to 2. We did use Raspberry Pi's for my OS development class and had to implement some multi-core stuff at an OS level but I think for standard software development it really depends on what language you are using. You can technically do multi-threaded with a single core CPU but it's obviously not as efficient as multi-threading on multi-core. This assumes you let the OS scheduler do all the work of dividing up the threads amongst cores.\n",

However, I'll give some further info from other findings.I have 2 laptops, 1 work laptop, the Vostro 5502, and my personal laptop, the Inspiron 15 7566.I was able to change the refresh rate on the Inspiron model by going to (on Windows) > Display settings > Select monitor > Advanced display settings > Display adapter properties for Display 2 (the Dell 2421HS). I was able to change the Screen refresh rate (in the Monitor tab).The thing that I noticed when the settings window opened, is that the Inspiron 7566 has the Intel HD Graphics 530 (on-board graphics) other than the Nvidia GTX 960M, and the Vostro 5502 has Intel Iris Xe Graphics (on-board) other than the Nvidia MX330.When I follow the same steps trying to change the refresh rate from the Vostro's side, I can only see a maximum of 60Hz.So, my thought was that it could have been something with Intel's display drivers, but no changes due to no updates available.I opened Intel's Graphics Command Center and saw under the Display tab, under Information, it shows at the bottom, the supported resolution at 1920 x 1080 (75p Hz), but 60p is the highest option selectable from the Refresh Rate option under the General tab.My troubleshoot will go on.[–]Marcel_Steenkamp[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago(0 children)So, from my further investigation, I see that the Intel Iris Xe allows for 60Hz at 1920x1080[–]Marcel_Steenkamp[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(2 children)Thanks for the detailed feedback.

As CCIE_ explained, what can be normal for you, is not expected normal for me.    I typically expect Lithium batteries to last \"yea many charges\" before it's time to replace. OR, if you are a harsh user, and often times let the battery drain to 0%.  That also decreases the lifetime of the battery.   As a person who experienced replacing 8 batteries for one laptop in it's lifetime...   Batteries can vary in longevity.\n",

I have my laptop switched on for pretty much the entire day and have it plugged in the entire day. My daily usage includes 6 hrs of online video meetings(MS Teams), 3-4 hrs of YouTube/video streaming. 4-5 hrs of doing assignments/studying, using word, powerpoint, Adobe Acrobat, Chrome etc.\n",
      "The laptop certainly does not power through all of that. I haven't tested the battery life but I'd say you'd get a solid 4-6 hrs of normal usage until the battery drops down to 20%. Dell claims that you'd get 7-8 hrs of battery life out of it. I think with my daily use scenario the battery drops down to 20% from a full charge after my online classes are over(5-6) hrs and that's when I start charging. Games are a big no no on battery so always plug it in before playing anything.\n",

      "content: between about 3-5 years ago we sold a couple (maybe 20 or 25) dell vostro 5568. when the first of those reached an age of about 2,5 years, we started to get complaints about those devices \"breaking\" at the hinge, ripping apart the casing and not being able to open/close the lid anymore. the cause of the problem is always the same: the screw that attaches the hinge to the \"bottom\" of the case is missing. as a consequence, the hinge breaks out of it's fixture and rips apart the computer. so far we heard of about 6 or 7 of them where the case actually broke apart, making the device unuseable. (one customers tried to got it fixed by dell but it was expensive and took a lot of time until it finally happened.) we investigated a few (4 or 5) other cases where there was no visible damage yet, but in all of those cases the screw was either already missing or clearly loose. so that's already about 50% of what we sold that is broken or was close to break. and that's only the cases that were reported to us... so i think it's safe to assume, that a very high percentage of those devices will break within maybe 2-4 years after they were sold, all due to the same weak point that is obviously present in that model. anybody have a similar experience? has dell ever acknowledged this quite striking problem? when we inquired dell, we were told that there is no such issue known to them.\n",

It's a high traffic part. So, I don't think it can be repaired. Unless you were able to somehow strengthen the hinge. I'm kind of surprised. Dell is usually good in the hinge dept.  Especially on older machines. It is likely that you can easily find the part on Ebay. Should be an easy fix.  Also, if you go to dell's support site and plug in your model# or even better, your Service Tag#. You can probably find the service manual.

The process to repair it is simpler than you'd think.  But obtaining the exact Chassis or part, might be daunting.   eBay is your best friend.  Dell provides Service Manuals for just about Everything they make. Checkout the support page.   Now for us tough guys...    You will for now on, carefully open and close the hinge lid.  Maybe even hold the plastics to help apply pressure to keep the metal bits inside in place well enough to adjust to the lid opening and closing.    Either the plastics surrounding the copper nut, used to mount the hinge assembly has broken, or a screw or two are loose.   HP/Acer laptops I hated the most for their poor hinge designs.[–]DeepestBlueDragon 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)Dismantle it. You *may* find that the hinges have a small nut on the end which you can loosen VERY SLIGHTLY to let your hinges move more freely.

So often times, the experience with using Dell's ProSupport services seems lackluster and downright failing to actually resolve problems. ​But this also is indicative of how Dell's QC/QA has gone downhill as well.   UNLESS.  You spend for the Pro Plus Premium type of packages where one actually deals with a support technician who has local residence, and experience to resolve the problem.   Sadly, I've also have many years at being a Biased For Dell type of guy. Only to find more and more Dells I work on, are often hobbled by the factory OS installations.   This is where I find many people don't realize that \"bloatware\" exists, even if the new clean factory install is where you started.  A reminder to people, that once you start up that new computer, it is already 6 months old, from fabrication, to warehouse waiting to ship.  Custom orders are essentially base products with the change orders made.    Factory OS installs are essentially images created to have all the pre-installed software/driver packages that support common-line models.  So like XPS/Inspiron G/Alienware laptops, often share the same base frame, but have widely different components installed. Same for factory OS installed, often times, a wide range of additional \"backend\" of things are loaded.    Anywho.  I often advise a clean install of the OS, and download the drivers ad-hoc.   When I received my Inspiron 15 7567, I presumed it was behind on firmware updates. And to no surprise. It was 3yrs of BIOS updates, behind.    Also knowing what the base specs of your Vostro will help give us an idea of why your performance is so poor.     The Vostro 5510 series comes in various options so, I presume the base model, and I would guarantee the HDD is part of your problem.   I'd double the RAM to help improve the performance of the lower end of the CPU specs.     A Vostro is pretty much right in your sights based on what you described as your needs.  Often when I am maintenance Vostro's, my typical first thing to replace are the HDDs to SSDs.[–]LCMTO[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)Thank you so much.

And when pressed it did nothing.  Actually had to read the tiny booklet that came with it to learn that one has to plug it into the ac adapter for first time set up.  Do they ship these things with depleted batteries these days? Sheesh!As Dell wanted $100 more to double the memory from base 8gb to 16gb I bought a 8gb module for $25 to install myself.  Installation requires removal of the bottom of the case and the use of a sponger to separate the clips.  Usually a simple task but on the cheap plastic bottom of this machine several of the clips broke.   That is what made me think it was Junk.Looks nice.  so far performs ok, but can't get over these two stupid things... why not have a sticker on the power button that says 'must be plugged into ac first'.  I nearly boxed it backup to return for DOA. Lol.[–]dsg1211 0 points1 point2 points 10 months ago(0 children)I recently bought a Vostro 5510 new on Ebay at a good price. I've been using Dell business-class machines for twenty years and so I was looking forward to getting this machine. This unit has a 512 GB SSD, 16 GB RAM, 11th generation I7 and an NVIDIA GeForce MX450 [Display adapter]. It's a nice performer. The keyboard is quiet but I'd have preferred a bit more key travel that I had with my Latitude E-7270. I really loved that Latitude but I wanted something that was ready for Windows 11 and the 7270 was not. My only concern, like others who have commented here and elsewhere, is the fact that it seems to get hot and I can feel this on the top half of the keyboard. I've set the Dell Power Manager at the \"cool\" setting and while I definitely hear the fan it's still hot. Perhaps not alarmingly hot but warmer than I'm used to and I'm just wondering if this could cause long-term harm to the unit or should I assume that the machine would just shut down if it got too hot. It's also odd that I so far can't locate any professional reviews for this particular Vostro model. Admittedly, I should have researched this before buying it but I had enough faith in Dell products that I just assumed that I couldn't go wrong with a business-class Vostro and I hope I was right.\n",

      "content of comments: (0 children)When it comes to lifespan, the larger a laptop is the better cooling is usually. Precisions were always bulkier than others and are meant for professionals, so that would be my choice. That said, not all product lines are consistent, so you might find something thicker in a cheaper line.[–]saperkus9010 SFF || Precision 7520 2 points3 points4 points 1 year ago(1 child)I had an opportunity to check Latitude 5420, Latitude 7420 and Precision 7560. Latitude 7420 is a toast - pretty warm and with almost everything soldered to a motherboard. I wouldn't buy it without at least 3Y warranty. Latitude 5420 is better in this case, but it can't take prolonged load - a strong throttling is applied after a minute or two of load (about 30% performance loss). Precision 7560 took prolonged load rather well and have probably the best touchpad in non-Mac devices. On the other hand it has less ports than Lenovo ThinkPad P15 G2 (it has 2xTB4, 2xUSB-C and 2xUSB-A) and worse internal port selection than HP ZBook Fury 15 G8 (it has 2xM.2 + 2xSATA or 4xM.2 ports for SSDs). Sadly, I didn't had an opportunity to test the later two, so can't say about their performance. However all of them have not soldered dGPUs, so even if dGPU will die, it can be replaced without replacing whole motherboard.[–]GlitchyDragon65Dell E7440, 8GB, 500GB HDD, i5-4th 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago(3 children)latitude models but will be overheating but not always[–]sidroy090998[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(2 children)Can u elaborate as to which series in latitude that overheats ,my pick is latitude 3420[–]GlitchyDragon65Dell E7440, 8GB, 500GB HDD, i5-4th 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(1 child)i don't know about latitude 3420 but no latitude series overheat unless you are doing very heavy gaming or programming but you are using it for graphic design so it will not overheat but if you simultaneously charge and do graphic design for a period of time it will definitely overheat (Personal experience) but dell latitude are made to handle overheat[–]maldax_ 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)It's an impossible question. Any laptop can fail, some of the same models go on forever while others will fail. If you are worried about the investment lasting your best bet would be to include Dell's Premium support for however many years they will let you. If it dies they will send a tech to fix it or replace it.[–]touristh8r 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)Don’t go with a 3xxx series precision as they have had heating issues lately.

This is a vast improvement over the 7590 if so.I have a 7590, and the parts I got for the price are absolutely insane, but one thing I had about mine is there is incessant coil whine. The only time it's inaudible is if it's on battery power. If it's plugged in, especially at 100% battery, the thing makes constant electrical noise, and it drives me insane.[–]beanimus0829[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago(2 children)Yea exhaust out both sides and speaker on top.I don’t hear much plugged in but I’d imagine it somewhat depends on your workload.Parts for price on these seem overlooked.  To me it is solid deal.[–]HSNubz 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(1 child)They probably fixed the issue then. This occurs no matter the load. Can be plugged in, entirely idle, insane coil whine. Really glad to hear they improved some of the issues. I don't have a lot of heat issues because I mostly use it on a hard surface so the vents have space underneath the case, but it just seems like a stupid design. Same with having the speakers on the bottom, but they were going for that \"sleek\" look.[–]pentiumred 1 point2 points3 points 9 months ago(0 children)i have terrible noise and heat issues[–]BayouBillyWithHeavyB 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(2 children)Speaker volume isn't great on this device either. If you want to game on  this device - you can get everything except the newer fps games to run in 1080p - however - you MUST go into the \"Dell Power Manager\" software, click on the \"Thermal Management\" tab and set it to \"Cool\". Optimized won't work - it will allow your CPU and GPU to fry themselves just to keep the fan noise down. Given the immense power of the CPU for a mobile device (the gen 11 and Zen 3 processors have made... noteworthy improvements on the previous generations) - you might even want to pop into BIOS and tell the CPU to avoid Turbo Boost, etc. Cash price for quality of hardware is very very good.[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)The hardware insane. After I got mine they raised the price back to 1700 USD.Fan kicks on when plugged in and under load. Battery power stays whisper quiet. Even on battery still blazing fast compared to my gaming computer (7700k 16gb ram). SSD and higher speed ram go a long way with this configuration.Agree on speaker volume but really designed around the business professional concept.  I still run hulu and listen to shows in the background but easy fix would be a little bluetooth speaker.  If just doing video calls I’m sure it would be fine.Not sure why they add a 3050ti but doesn’t hurt.[–]SUPERCELLEX 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)protip: if you want a bomb, slip it into ultra performance mode, your computer will now consooooooom 120W in the name of Allah[–]MonotonicO_Music 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(9 children)Hi. I see you posted this 2 months ago but I am wondering if this is strictly a business computer or if it will fun music production software like fl studios without much latency? I see the processor is really good and it has a solid amount of ram. Thanks![–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(8 children)I'm not sure if latency is related to codes or hardware but I'll say that the speakers are not the loudest.  Processor is insanely good but I'm also coming over from my 7700k for comparison.Basically the audio is ok and probably great for zoom calls but typically I connect to Sony wh-1000xm4 that I have for music and all else where I want good audio.[–]MonotonicO_Music 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(7 children)Thanks for the reply. From my understanding latency is reduced by having a good CPU and lots of Ram. I'm going to conect it to speakers so I think that will fix the audio or use headphones. I'm also coming from a slow cpu so I think this should work fine.[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(6 children)Yea latest gen i7 is pretty hard to beat. I know a lot of people prefer AMD but at a certain level doesn't really matter.  As a disclosure, I don't run windows because how much bloatware came installed from the factory.  Dell loads it up.  Even a fresh install wasn't loads better sitting at 4gb idle and me disabling as many startup applications as possible.

      "I ordered and paid 2 times.

I purchased Win 10 pro with Win 11 upgrade, i-7, 3050TI, ITB, thunderbolt 4 connector. They had a new system on the Dell outlet for $648 and there were 8 available. I took the one year of accident replacement plus taxes and the total was 797 and change. A super deal!. And the order sat there for days --I kept checking.  Three days later I get an email that the warehouse rejected the order and he has to manually put it back in so he put in the same specs and same price and I replied by email and said OK. He said he would call me.  No call. I call the # on the email and he does not have a VM set up so I emailed him a number of times.  He responds Weds night and says the cart expired and I can get the same system for $1184 because they were giving me a discount I told him no way -- we went back and forth and I called numerous times and finally I said I want a supervisor. I wanted to tell them to f --off but I had already purchased the Thunderbolt dock. Finally, Aa sup called on Thanksgiving and said he will have to get approval for it.  Fine. Get it. Finally, he called me today and I had to give my payment info again and now the order is complete. All the folks I spoke with had very heavy Indian accents. I wonder if they are even located in the US. Anyhow it is resolved. The dell outlet seems disorganized. I think they have scratch and dent models now.[–]tuannm30 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)I agree with your comments.They canceled my order 2 times, until the 3rd time they process my order.\n",
      "They sent me an email asking me to call 866-383-4713 to verify the payment, but when I called (total 3 times) I met an Indian. Their English is difficult to hear, and they don't solve the problem for me.However, the order continue to be shipped. Their process seems a bit cumbersome, unprofessional.[–]Reddotist 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(3 children)I was finally able to find a review of this laptop. So after 3 months do you think this laptop is worth it?[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(2 children)So it is tough to say for others, but I really like the hardware. Tiger lake i7 with 16 cores, 16gb ram, 1 tb SSD with another open m.2 slot, and 3050ti.  I was happy at 1200 with tax in the middle of a chip shortage. There are things I don't like so much. If you hold it up by the bottom with your right hand in the corner, it flexes enough that you can't click (oddly specific scenario I rarely encounter). The speakers are really not loud. Very moderate tone and without a doubt just made for Skype calls and basic things.  Sooooooo much pre-installed bloat. Battery would have been better in larger size but pretty easy to get 6-8 hours use I do like how impressively quick the computer is. Easy to install Linux on. The actual design is slim and easy to transport. Fingerprint sensor is nice to have. It looks like a business computer but can also play light games no problem.So 3 months later, yes I'm happy. If other computers have similar specs in the price range then couldn't hurt either depending on use.[–]Reddotist 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(1 child)Thanks, I'll probably buy one for 1100 (tax included) in BF. The only thing I don't like is that the 2021 version they removed the 97Whr battery version (not sure why). However, as a CS student, I code a lot and only play light Esport games, so I prioritize weight and portability over performance. Hopefully it will last for the next 4-5 years.[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)The hardware is somewhat future proof I would say. I've heard rumor that you can order a higher capacity battery, but after opening to install the other SSD I'm not really sure how you could. In Pop OS you can change to integrated graphics only and get crazy battery life. Other distros of Linux programs like powertop go a long way. Took me from 2 hours of battery life to around 7-8. Windows also gets great battery life. Around 5-6 hours of video.  Easy 8 hours text editing/spreadsheets/web browsing.  It is really tough to pinpoint exact battery life because if you are gaming it will be close to the two hours. I'm sure compiling code will have a similar effect.  For battery life I doubt you beat an m1 I just didn't like the fact that it started at 8gb of ram and 256gb SSD.  With stuff I do in excel with vlookup, if logic, and template imports I used to crush that little ram.[–]dinayo_vvooko15 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(3 children)Thanks for the review, I just purchased one - same specs --from the outlet and new. They had a terrific Black Friday special so on 11-21 I purchased it with accident insurance and taxes for just a hair under $900. And similar to what another poster wrote they canceled the order. I called and called and emailed and would not take NO for an answer. Finally only today --- they honored it.I am not a gamer. I plan on using it for business and for video editing.All of my computers have been refurbs so I was the one that installed the cards and operating system.  I have never had a brand new system so I have questions about reinstalling the OS. You said there is a ton of bloatware. Is there anything that I should keep before reinstalling? Do I have to then download all the drivers and such like I do on the ones I refurb?  Do you recommend doing this right away?Thanks,[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(1 child)There is an option in windows called something similar to fresh start when you go to format. I believe it is supposed to remove all vendor software.  My advice is boot with the bloat and see if there is anything you want or that is useful to you.  There wasn't for me and pretty quickly I removed Windows after as I moved onto manjaro Linux. Also don't forget you have an open m.2 on your board.[–]dinayo_vvooko15 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)Great. Thanks. They said it will ship Tues and for all the aggravation they are sending it expedited.

Web browsing and spreadsheets easy 5+ hours. Depends on your system. In windows they manage power settings pretty well with Windows 10. In Linux I can disable the GPU completely and switch to integrated graphics.

      "Upgraded it to Windows 11 without issue and then went ahead and removed all the pre-installed bloat except for a few Dell things (battery management / upgrade stuff).  I installed Steam and have no issue getting 60fps (while plugged in) playing Valheim -which was the reason I purchased this laptop; to play that addicting game when I'm on business trips and stuck in a hotel for days.  I also tested out Cities: Skylines but I don't have a Bluetooth mouse with a double click button so it's unplayable at the moment.  But, it looked fine and had no hiccups.I used to carry around a Surface Go2 so to me the screen looks Huge and bright.  I bought the measly 8GB since I read that you can upgrade the memory yourself - is this true?  You can pop another SODIMM in?  So far with just 8GB I haven't really seen any issues.  You guys have a website somewhere that shows you how to open this thing and add the memory etc...?[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(6 children)I upgraded the m.2 which is just an open slot but the original it comes with is an odd size so had to swap slots to fit the other. Ram is two slots but never verified if it is soldered.Yes a lot of gaming laptops have dedicated buttons so you can move and click on track pad but realistic approach is to use a mouse.[–]usafle 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(5 children)The same spec'ed Dell G15 Laptop was almost double the price for this one!  I guess if you add some fancy RGB lights in a keyboard and slap the word Gaming on it, makes it more expensive.  Your review helped me a lot with the purchase as well as some of the others that have commented on this thread.  So, thank you, again.What did you upgrade the m.2...too? Concerning the RAM, I'm assuming it has to be matched?  So I can only get up to 16gb total on here if the first one is soldered on the board, correct?[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(4 children)Ram you should go matching yes. I added a second 1tb SSD I had in the slot so running 2tb. I keep an Kernal on each and treat one like a work profile and the other a personal goof around. I own my company so easy for me to do.[–]usafle 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(3 children)So 16GB if the 8gb is indeed soldered into the Mobo. So you replaced both SSDs?  I didn't see a config for a shipped / OEM 1TB SSD.  The largest I saw was the 512GB.[–]usafle 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(4 children)So I've been tinkering with this laptop the past few days and so far, it's pretty damn good.  I've managed to free up a lot of memory but removing most of the unnecessary Dell pre-installed Bloat (just like the OP mentioned; so much bloat)  I've also successfully ran Display Driver Uninstaller in safe mode and then rebooted and NVCleaninstall to get rid of GeForce Experience (which was eating up some CPU and RAM) and all the NVIDIA telemetry crap.  The only issue was some sot of NVIDIA Framework Device manager that was missing drivers.  The fix for that; download the OEM Dell NVIDIA drivers, extract to a temp folder and then point the NVIDIA Framework Device to that folder to install those drivers.The MaxAudio software that is installed to, I guess help, with the speakers are eating up some RAM and CPU cycles as well.  Not sure if removing them would make the speakers worse or non-functional?I've managed to get my paltry 8GB RAM system below 45% usage after doing all those tweaks so, not bad!I'm trying to research where and what memory to get to install into the machine and if indeed the first DIMM is soldered into the mobo or not.[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(3 children)Are you in windows 11 or 10?  I never tried 11 and heard it is worse in bloat. Since they won't allow 7700k or older I'd imagine pretty bloated.[–]usafle 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(2 children)I'm now on Windows 11.  I didn't really mess with tweaking the device when it was on Win10 because I knew I was going to immediately upgrade to 11 when it was pushed.  I also removed all the stuff from Win11 I was never going to use. So far I haven't really seen anymore (or less) bloat from Win11 vs Win10.  Just found the Dell service manual for the laptop.  If I am reading it correctly DIMM1 isn't soldered onto the MoBo and can be removed normally.  So, if that's true, it's good news.  I can theoretically max out the memory to 64GB if I wanted to go that high.You've been inside the case when you upgraded your SSD - did you happen to look at the memory modules when you cracked it open to verify?[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(1 child)No just looked at the m.2. I got 16gb ram and my default System boots around 1gb ram usage so I haven't looked into upgrading ram. I can say it is pretty easy to open and look at though.[–]usafle 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)I'm debating whether or not to upgrade from the 512 m.2 to something else along with the RAM at the same time or just do them one at a time.  I'm not sure if I trust myself to open the case more than once without breaking something. LoLJust have to hunt around for some deals first.You said in an earlier post that you couldn't put another m.2 in beside the OEM m.2 due to the weird size?  I'm going to assume then that you reformatted everything and started from scratch?[–]Xtian_Ar 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago*(1 child)Why do people expect to use the laptop for gaming if it wasn't designed to do that? For gaming there is a specific DELL line, not Vostro line. It may be that it can be used for gaming from time to time, but without expecting too much. I think it is better for office use and video editing tasks.[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago(0 children)Neither was the TI-83 graphing calculator but it doesn't stop people. I could see the appeal of having a laptop that looks ready for business but can also run light gaming.  In theory at a conference no one has to know in my other drive I have steam and games setup for when I'm bored at the hotel.[–]dinayo_vvooko15 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago(0 children)I updated mine to Win 11. The 1-tb drive so far is enough for me with the 16 GB RAM. Have been mainly using plugged in with the Dell 19TB dock. Wifi is super fast although I'm currently working on running an ethernet connection to the dock. Had a hard time finding the TB vs the TBS. Main difference is I wanted the audio connectors. (1 x 1/8\" / 3.5 mm Headphone/Microphone Combo\n",
      "1 x 1/8\" / 3.5 mm Line-Out). For now, I have 2 27 inch side-by-side QHD monitors connected. Once the company I'm with starts us up with travel again I will see how well it does on battery power. I also have a 1-tb external hard drive and would eventually consider adding a second 1 tb internal SSD and going with more RAM. I have 3 laptops on my network - the other 2 are on Win 10 pro - older laptops that work just fine however according to Microsoft are not upgradeable due to the processor. It was a small adjustment getting used to win 11. For business and personal use, I am satisfied with it. The outlet experience was awful though. I did write to them with details and, not surprisingly, never receive a response.[–]pentiumred 1 point2 points3 points 9 months ago(3 children)i have one i7-11800H -- 1TB SSD -- RTX3050 Ti​It runs so damn hot and loud, im quite disappointed as i paid almost 1200 euros[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(2 children)Strange. Mine is typically insanely quiet. Especially on battery. Maybe check your bios settings.[–]pentiumred 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(1 child)what settings do you have? what applications do you run?[–]beanimus0829[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago(0 children)I just run the default in bios but I removed the boat of Dell software. If you are gaming the fans will kick on, but everything else it is quiet.  I don't hear my fans in sheets, browsing, or other normal use.[–]Mundane-Extension981 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago(0 children)Hello, is the fan noise loud?  I had the Inspiron and the fans were really loud and the keyboard got really hot.  Any feedback would be great, thank you![–]Swag_Grenade 0 points1 point2 points 4 months ago(0 children)Yo I know this post is a year old but I just ordered this laptop, what would you say the average battery life you get is as I've seen that seems to be the number one complaint about this model. Also you said you don't have issues with it running loud or hot, if so that's good to know. I was wondering where you saw the display was 400 nits though cause per the official Dell spec document it says 300 so IDK.Anyways thanks if you happen to see this.\n",

      "content: i couldn't find a review of this computer anywhere but it was recently on slickdeals for 1149 usd with latest gen i7, 1tb ssd, 16gb ram 3200mhz, and a 3050ti (not especially important for the build). ​ first impressions for this computer were bad. if there were an award for least sexy unboxing, this would be up there for sure. just some cardboard and scotch tape over a flap to prevent tampering in shipping. it didn't help when i booted it up and was almost at 8gb ram usage out of the box before opening apps. so first thing i did was a fresh reinstall of windows removing apps that were loaded in. removing the built antivirus they shipped with freed up almost 4gb of ram by itself(i did this before the fresh install just to check). worth keeping in mind that when you first setup a computer it will have a lot going on with updates and such so battery, ram usage, and overall speed will be affected during this time. my fans were also kicking on while plugged in and nothing really crazy that i was doing. i immediately started to worry i was hit with the heating issues i always hear everyone complain about. ​ after the fresh install of windows however my view changed on this computer. the ram usage with nothing going on stays around 4gb and running a few browsers(chrome for my personal email and items and firefox for work related with quite a few tabs) goes to about 8gb. the speed on this is amazing. my previous computer was a 15\" 2014 macbook pro but i also have a gaming pc with 7700k, 16gb ram, 1080ti, and clean windows install. i've been running light photo editing, large excel files, browsers, videos, and using like most people will use without any lag or even the fans coming on. sure if you run a stress test or something the fans will come on but other than the first time booting they have not. ​ let me also say this is not a gaming computer. it may have a graphics card but it would make much more sense to stream from my other computer. the vostro series is know to be more for business professionals and i would say does a great job in that category. i did run bioshock 2 remastered on here and even in battery saver with integrated graphics it wasn't an issue. no noticeable frame drops or stutters. i did get a message in the beginning it was not supported with the integrated graphics but no issue. when plugged in on the 3050ti also obviously no issue. in games you will get the fans spinning as this computer is ready to give you everything it has when plugged in and it is incredibly slim. ​ a 56 watt hour battery is more than you would think. browsing and actually using my computer for work i run into no issues making it through a day. if i did have to charge it up the charger provided is insanely quick. if you can leave it for an hour untouched you are going to be pretty close to charged again. sure it would be nice if it was larger but if it works and keeps the design slim, why not? the smart switch between gpu and integrated graphics as well as varying power to processor go a long way to preserving the battery it does have. i haven't tried out the type c charging. ​ 400 nits display. doesn't bother me and feels plenty bright. it has a 1080p display and i would bet that is part of why the smaller battery stays effective. you could run a 4k display and crank the brightness but for what they are trying to build in the vostro line i don't know if that would make sense. this thing is a beast of a work computer but i doubt i need to look at excel in 4k and 144hz refresh to be more productive. ​ i'm no tech expert but have a background in mobility sales and ecommerce. if there is anything i've missed that you want to know, just let me know and i'll try to answer as best i can.\n",

The only real difference is that Vostros are considered business laptops while inspirons are considered consumer laptops. Meanning that the Vostro gets Dell business support (the best support dell has) while the inspiron gets regular support. Oftentimes the Vostros will also come default with windows pro.All else being equal...
