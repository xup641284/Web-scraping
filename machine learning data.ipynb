       "'hello everyone, i purchased an xps 17 9710 in january 2020 and just after 1 week of use i entered the uefi bios (version 1.6.0) and changed some settings, nothing serious just the keyboard backlight and battery settings. after restart, the pc won´t pass dell logo (no post) as dell call it. and the status light in the front of the laptop flashed 2 times amber and 8 times white. started to research on it and found out that according to dell \"display failure - ec detection of power rail failure\". dell support team troubleshooted the device and then advice for a motherboard replacement due to the that power rail failure. a month later i received my device and entered bios... i was in real disbelief when again the same happened, and again the motherboard was replaced. after the second replacement i updated the uefi bios firmware to the latest version and as my warranty is running out, i contacted dell to talk about this. the support agent ran a couple of test on my computer and advised to enter the boot menu and run an extensive diagnostic on the machine. every test passed without any issues, and from that same boot menu screen i entered the bios once again almost 1 year after the 2° mobo replacement. it went ok, i just browsed through the options without making any change whatsoever. i do not have the confidence to make any changes to a bios setting even with the latest firmware. the laptop has been working flawlessly, i just don´t want to lose my pc for 1 month again while dell issues a replacement for me. do anyone has had this issue? could you please confirm if recent bios firmware do not compromise the power rail as it happened twice to me? any help would be appreciated. hello everyone, i purchased an xps 17 9710 in january 2020 and just after 1 week of use i entered the uefi bios (version 1.6.0) and changed some settings, nothing serious just the keyboard backlight and battery settings. after restart, the pc won´t pass dell logo (no post) as dell call it. and the status light in the front of the laptop flashed 2 times amber and 8 times white. started to research on it and found out that according to dell \"display failure - ec detection of power rail failure\". dell support team troubleshooted the device and then advice for a motherboard replacement due to the that power rail failure. a month later i received my device and entered bios... i was in real disbelief when again the same happened, and again the motherboard was replaced. after the second replacement i updated the uefi bios firmware to the latest version and as my warranty is running out, i contacted dell to talk about this. the support agent ran a couple of test on my computer and advised to enter the boot menu and run an extensive diagnostic on the machine. every test passed without any issues, and from that same boot menu screen i entered the bios once again almost 1 year after the 2° mobo replacement. it went ok, i just browsed through the options without making any change whatsoever. i do not have the confidence to make any changes to a bios setting even with the latest firmware. the laptop has been working flawlessly, i just don´t want to lose my pc for 1 month again while dell issues a replacement for me. do anyone has had this issue?

my co worker thinks it has to do something with the way the 12th gen processor was built anything with nvme and the largest size you can find within your budget. samsungs are very good. view poll hey everyone, this is a pretty niche use-case but i figure i\\'d post it here in case someone with this laptop is curious about an egpu. running the new dell xps - i7 1260p/16gb ram/1080p screen. i have it hooked up to a razer core x with an rtx 3070 (not the ti). the core x is plugged into a 1440p monitor and i can reasonably play almost any game. been running rdr2 on high (can do ultra on 1080p), gta5, and i even got half life alyx to work with no hiccups wireless streamed to my quest 2 via virtual desktop. it doesn\\'t make sense for me to have a different desktop than my laptop since i travel often and need it for work, so this egpu set-up is awesome! could i seek any opinions from owners of the 2022 xps 15 as to whether the xps 15 is still ok as a portable device taken to the office? is it too heavy to be routinely taken to office. i\\'ve ordered an oled model but having 2nd thoughts. another bug bear is the lack of ports. i have an hdmi monitor, wireless keyboard, and usb a flash drive and would have no issue with these on alternative laptops e.g. lenovo x1 carbon gen 10, but am really limited by the lack of hdmi, and usb a on the xps 15. would have to constantly use the dongle and then potentially still have issues with lack of usb a. however i was drawn to it by the reported good screen, processing power, upgradeability of ram and ssd in the future, and the reasonable battery life on 12th gen processor. i don\\'t really game. mostly for office work, but want something that will still be doing well in 4-5 years. alternatives include lenovo yoga 7i. tldr: what kind of cpu socket is in this? what’s the cheapest cpu that will fit in it? what’s the cheapest ram that will fit? it’s a dell xps 8950 —— long story: i was turning around at the end of this gravel road i noticed a pc tower sitting in the rain. i throw it in the trunk. later on i open it up and see the cpu/ram/gpu/nvme is missing. i plugged it in an i got power in the leds. no video output. keyboard and mouse powered up. i assumed it’s because of no ram and cpu. i’ve built computers before so i’m not a complete beginner. but this one is stumping me a bit. sticker on the case says i7. the socket says lga 17xx/lga18xx. so i go to ebay to sort by this socket type and see what the cheapest buy it now cpu is. this ain’t even a socket option. i type in the service code and find the original configuration but even that’s super confusing.there’s nothing that says what kind of ram and cpu is compatible with this. so what’s the cheapest way i can test to see if this thing is working? no water seems to have gotten inside the case. i don’t think it was there long. i looked to see if i could find the original owner because i wouldn’t be surprised if this was stolen. but nothing came up when i googled find stolen dell owner. i assume they probably wouldn’t be too excited since all the good stuff is missing anyway. if the mobo and psu were fine are my assumptions correct that i wouldn’t get to a bios screen without a cpu and ram? my current pc is a ryzen that uses ddr4 ram. that ram didn’t fit. i have another pc with an i5. it’s from 2016 and i assume this is a much newer socket. i‘m looking at picking up an xps 13 plus, and i’m curious if anyone has real-world experience with high-resolution, multiple external display support? reading the documentation (https://dl.dell.com/content/manual17257051-xps-13-plus-9320-xps-9320-external-display-connection-guide.pdf?language=en-us&ps=true), it seems to be self contradictory. it says: you can connect up to two 4k external displays or one 5k and above display using the thunderbolt 4 (usb-c) ports available on your xps 13 9320. on page 4 - page 6 says it supports 3 4k external displays, or 1 8k - page 10 faq about 8k displays lists faqs for multiple 8k displays. the specific configuration i’m hoping to use the laptop with is 4k + 6k + 4k. the two 4k’s connected via a tb4 dock, and the 6k directly to the laptop. i’ve looked at the intel xe specs, which suggests it would be supported — but i had tried a surface pro 9, which has the same gpu specs, and it did not drive the 6k display. who wants to be first to take the leap?

i highly doubt dell is going to replace anything for just that as i\\'ve seen them deny much worse. so, my company (started a new job today) got me an 15\" xps (9520). i\\'m a thinkpad guy. the machine is fine so far, looks nice, works alright, few complaints (ignoring that it comes with malware/bloatware preinstalled and that win11 is .. not great). there\\'s one thing that already drives me mad after 8+ hours of using it: the keyboard. is there any way to have both function keys (f1-f12 - all of them) without the fn nonsense and have a home/end key? i need all the fx keys for work (some more than others, but f3, f4, f5, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12 are a constant thing for me to use and i always always always always need home and end. ctrl + home / ctrl + end is something i use every few minutes. home and end are on \"f11\" and \"f12\" (in quotes, because the way fn and fx keys are handled makes zero sense to me). is there a software solution? did anyone figure out a way to fix this mess? i .. plan to carry a keyboard everywhere with this laptop otherwise, because this is breaking things for me one way or the other a bunch of times, every hour. i can either have fx keys (non-negotiable) or home/end (desperately needed). how do you guys handle this? i\\'ve got a xps 13 9310 and luckily my computer has thunderbolt support; though i\\'ve never used it. i\\'ve been researching usb hubs and docking stations and of course the ones with thunderbolt 4 compatibility are way more expensive so i came here to ask you folks if it would be worth the upgrade? morning, i\\'ve just got myself a dell refurbished xps 13 9310 ads have been trying to get the fingerprint and ir camera working and was wondering if anybody has managed this in arch? i\\'ve googled and read the wiki and nowt seems to work. that said i\\'m not the most experienced in arch, i can install from scratch but struggle on the more complex tasks. so any help would be appreciated. i\\'m a photojournalist and am looking to upgrade my laptop. just looking for some second opinions on the two i\\'m debating between. right now, i have a dell xps 15 (9550) and overall still love it — it has a nice variety of ports (both usb c and usb 3.0, hdmi, sd card reader, headphone jack, a dedicated power port), beautiful borderless qhd display, 1tb ssd, etc. unfortunately, it\\'s gotten to a point where the battery only lasts about an hour and it\\'s struggling to keep up with lightroom, premiere, etc. there are two potential replacements that i\\'m debating between on sale for around the same price: macbook pro 16\", m1 pro, 16 gb ram, 1 tb ssd dell xps 15 (9520) 3.5k oled display, i9, 32 gb ram, nvidia geforce rtx 3050 ti, 1 tb ssd on paper, while both pretty powerful, the xps has twice as much ram and a dedicated graphics card. my main concerns with it is the battery life and lack of ports (just three usb c). on the other hand, the macbook pro likely has better battery life and more ports, but might be less powerful and i generally prefer windows to macos. also, when i used a friend\\'s macbook pro, the transfer rate from my sd card seemed significantly slower for some reason. i have minimum processor state set to 0% when on battery. it looks like the minimum frequency that subject processor will go to is ~1.5ghz. i also have turbo boost disabled when on battery. i have noticed increased battery life without sacrificing basic productivity speed (afterall this is a 8-core/16-thread processor). i thought i read that this processor is good down to 800mhz. is there a way to set a minimum frequency so it can go below 1.5ghz when not needed? i bought a dell xps 15 9520 in november 2022. used the laptop a few times in december, and didn\\'t turn on for a week because of travel. today, i tried to turn it on and the laptop was completely dead. no sign of life. i called dell and they are sending a technician to replace the motherboard. \\u200b questions for the group: \\u200b am i eligible to replace this dell laptop (purchased in november 2022) with a new laptop? have you had this situation before? what was the result? how can this be possible? i was under the impression that by purchasing an expensive machine, i would have fewer problems. thank you for your time, and happy new year :) i\\'m thinking of repasting my machine and would really appreciate some pointers as to brands / types to use. this will be the first time that i will be doing this kind of thing so any help would be really appreciated. i\\'m already under volting the machine to reduce thermal issues which has helped but i wanted to go a step further by repasting. any help / advice would be really appreciated - thanks in advance. does anyone else have uneven lighting on their xps 9520 uhd screen that looks like this? i attached a photo which shows it pretty well. there\\'s a large area in the middle of the display that looks brighter and a bit warmer than the rest and in person its actually pretty obvious. it\\'s like there\\'s a diffused light source in front of the computer thats reflecting off of it, and it moves up and down when you tilt the screen. i\\'m trying to figure out if my laptop is defective or if this is just a quirk with this model. thanks for any help! https://preview.redd.it/z4r5msa2njaa1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e969db488f33bd7ad70b8f3a3e4e327d499eee5b does anybody know a source that can confirm if the 1920x1200 uses pwm to dim the display or not? thanks! (first post here/ever on reddit so bear with me please) the title, basically. had this model for about 2 years, and haven’t had any problems until a few days ago. i’ve done some casual gaming on it (probably not the smartest idea), which made it run hot and the fans a little loud from trying to cool. now whenever the fans ramp up, this weird noise (video) starts happening and i’m not quite sure what is going on here. is the fan dying, something stuck in there, or something else entirely? if anyone has any advice for this, i’d appreciate it a lot! ...watch me jinx it with this post.... 🙄😑🙏🙏🙏 as titled; i\\'ve had a brand new (~aug. 2022-ish) dell xps plus 13\" laptop & plagued with trackpad issues. wasted way too much time tinkering with it, should have reloaded windows straight away, but whatev... 🙄😑 using the factory dell partition / image on the ssd, i reset / reinstalled windows 11 pro & so far the touchpad has been 100% *perfect*!!! i didn\\'t even have to install any updates; as soon as the windows restore finished, it was working perfectly well \"out of the box\" so to speak, with everything set to defaults, and whatever patch / / firmware / update level it left the factory with. obviously i am installing all updates, esp. firmware that dell released for this thing, but it has been working perfectly *without* any updates whatsoever... i know reinstalling windows is a giant pita, but i recently came across this app & it has made reloading windows truly painless: https://web.laplink.com/product/pcmover-home/#tabs2 \\u200b anyway; i know the touchpad has been the bane of many people\\'s existence; looks like dell just didn\\'t image them properly from the factory or something..... idk....... if you\\'ve been struggling with the trackpad of your dell xps 13 plus, i\\'d stop wasting time & just reload windows. hope this helps someone. i have a dell xps 9310 and the damn thing only had 2 usb c chargers; that really bothered me when i got this. anyway, my two usb c ports on my laptop have become maybe bent or loosened over time with all the adapters and dongles. because when charging, the cord naturally just hangs down and that has in turn stretched the port, therefore the cable just falls out all the time. some with the other port with the usb to usb c adapters/dongles. adding that extra length to the stick naturally makes it droop/hang down and it has stretched the port. it\\'s hard using usb sticks anymore because those also fall out. idk if this is common with these computers or what, but does anybody have any ideas. i could obviously get the ports changed, but the same issue will eventually happen after several months. thanks for reading hi all, can you guys tell me why there is no \"wake on approach\" feature in xps 15 9520? i guess it is available in xps 13 plus but not in xps 15 9520 model? any hardware constraint? thanks the model seems amazing but i really wanna to use linux, not windows. xps15 9520. when i replaced the screen, i accidentally broke these two screws...now they were just stripped. i understand these two screws (and that silver piece) help to \"press\" the screen cable in place, so i guess if they were loosed, there could be connection issue with the screen? or even worse? any ideas/advice? i bought a refurbished model direct from dell, and it is giving me so much grief. what started as a graphics issue has led to trouble with my windows installation after an attempted repair organised by dell, then the camera dying, not to mention several other minor software issues. also, it heats up pretty severely... while i have premium support warranty on it, this laptop is honestly becoming a major inconvenience, rather than a happy purchase. it\\'s usable for light tasks at the moment, but it feels like my 2018 inspiron 13 was better quality than this xps. at what point is it reasonable to be given a replacement? does anyone have any good experiences with this model of xps? hi, my 9310 broke and was was wondering whether it\\'s better to get the 9315 clamshell or 9320 (xps plus). i don\\'t like the 9315 2in1 since it has no fan and has its 2 usb c port on the same side (horrible) and heard mixed experience regarding its form factor (detachable keyboard and weight etc). just to reassure myself, the 9315 9w i7 12th gen performs better than 9310 11th gen i7 right? i\\'m leaning towards 9315 but i heard the 9320 is x2 the performance but 9315 has better battery life and runs cooler and more quiet. i\\'m hesitant to get the 9320 because it seems to be hotter, worse battery life and i would have to get used to its new touchpad + fn keys + keyboard. i don\\'t really need touchscreen but i care about the display so was wondering whether the non touchscreen or touchscreen display looks better for 9315? edit: turns out the difference is touchscreen = ips display, non touch screen = matte display. will choose ips. also i plan to use fedora linux so was wondering if either choice would have any issues as well? has anyone tried using egpu with either model as well? so coming from 9310, is the 9315 or 9320 better? should i get the xps plus for its performance and deal with its downside or stick to 9315 and take the performance hit? thanks for the help, this dilemma is stressful.. hi, my xps 13 9310 won\\'t windows reset, keeps on failing with no reason given. everything is up to date, driver wise. i wanted to simply reinstall windows 11 keeping my data. i\\'ve done a fair bit of troubleshooting but can\\'t seem to get the reset to work. \\u200b when purchased it came with windows 10, so the dell recovery wants to restore to windows 10 from about 18 months ago, not what i want. it is also out of service warranty. \\u200b knowing the above, i\\'ve backed up my data with the intention of using a bootable mirco sd (or usb if the micro sd in not bootable) to format & remove all the dell restore drives and fresh install windows 11. \\u200b is this sensible... or is there another easier/better option. thanks for any suggestions. i purchased a fully specced out xps15 9520 in july and i have barely used it. i regret purchasing it and am looking to sell it. i live in ireland and any laptop buying websites offer up to €500 for used laptops, they obviously have no interest in a €3000 laptop. so i posted it on a lot of buy/sell services in ireland but could not find any buyers, there obviously aren\\'t many people out there looking for something like this. any tips on any international or irish services which will buy something like this? cpu fan is crapping out. its making a chugging sound or whirring sound. i\\'ve got dell premium support plus and just called in a tech repair visit. i feel like its just a simple fan replacement but this is the 3rd or 4th rodeo i\\'ve had with dell since buying a xps 13 back in 2017 and honestly they are notorious for royally fucking up simple repairs. previous repair attempts included causing more damage to laptop, repair tech using a gross workstation with shattered screen glass all over it, one bricked unit, replacement boards failing multiple times resulting in a complete new system replacement. all these service requests took months to resolve. fml. i received my xps 15 9520 in late july. since just about day one of running it, almost every time i booted it up i would get the support assist screen saying it was testing the processing fans. a month later, i began my semester in a pretty demanding program, and simply didn\\'t have the time to deep dive into the issue. i also ended up using the computers on campus, as they were optimized for my study activities. when i did use the laptop over the fall semester, it performed ok at best; the keyboard would often get really hot, the fan would randomly start spinning quite loudly, and it sometimes would be quite stubborn when i was trying to boot it up (wouldn\\'t turn on on the first try, etc...). so, when the semester ended, i got in touch with dell. first they had me run diagnostics over the phone, and when those failed to resolve the issue, they sent a tech to replace the fans. the new fans made a difference... for a day. and then out of nowhere i started getting blue screen errors, with different error messages each time. again, i called premium support, and again, they had me run diagnostics as well as remote accessed the laptop to run more tests. these phone calls ended up being around 2 hours each time. the issues persisted, so we got to the point where the tech wanted me to backup my files so we could do a reinstall of windows. upon reinstalling windows, the laptop would not recognize any wifi networks, and after some poking around the tech realized it was because the wifi drivers needed to be reinstalled. he said he would email them to me so i could load them onto a flash drive and then transfer them to the laptop. this would about 3 hours into the phone call. at that point, i thanked him for his help but explained that these calls were taking up way too much time (i\\'d sunk about 12 hours into dealing with tech support up until then), and asked to speak to a manager about a replacement or refund because i don\\'t have endless hours to be on the phone with tech support, especially as nothing they had done had resolved the issue. i spoke with several supervisors, and just got off the phone today with a customer service rep from their \"corporate\" team, and they all said the same thing: a) technical issues happen with computers, b) you should have called sooner, its past 30 days so a refund or replacement is impossible, and c) they can send a tech to come fix it. all in all, a pretty crappy experience, both in terms of customer service and in the performance of the laptop. if anyones considering a dell product, i would advise looking elsewhere. i\\'ve just received a dell windows xps 13 9310 laptop. the question i have is, can i download then install dell\\'s ubuntu image on it? i\\'m helping someone troubleshoot some strange issues with their wd19tbs docking station and dell xps 15 9520. they primarily use the docking station while using the laptop, but this week decided to work from a new location. they tried using the charger that came with the laptop but it wasn\\'t providing a charge. they decided to just go back to the docking station since the laptop was about to die, but received a battery notification from windows stating \"slow charger: to speed up charging, use the charger that came with the device. i confirmed the user is using the 180w power supply that came with the wd19tbs and i also confirmed they\\'re using the thunderbolt ports rather than the usb-c ports. we have attempted installing just about every driver i could find for this model laptop and docking station. looking for some direction on what could be causing this issue. side note: the user also mentioned the 2 hp 27er monitors they use with the docking station are randomly flickering throughout the day. this could be related to an overall docking station issue, but not 100% sure about that. dell just announced the new latitude 9440 and it looks to be a combination of the xps 13 plus and the latitude 9330. the xps had the newer keyboard design and the 9330 had the meeting controls built into the track pad. the hdmi port is gone and looks to be a slimmer design overall. andrew marc has a first look video and it is shipping in march. it should have both u and p series processor options. any others experiencing this weird battery behavior? is this a know issue? should i do something about it? how to prevent this from happening again? the most weird thing, is that the laptop has been plugged in all the time, there is no way the battery was draining. with my laptop plugged in, on optimized battery through windows and on cool thermals option in mydell, my laptop gets 1243 single core and 10358 multi core scores on geekbench. is this bad or normal? i show being in the 20th percentile but i\\'m unsure if its due to my power settings. thanks! also quick thing, can it handle 144hz refresh when i\\'m at home i use my xps15 with the lid closed and connected via \"selore\" usb-c hub to 2 x hdmi monitors, keyboard and mouse. all works fine until i restart or switch-off/switch-on, at which point the monitors do not come back on, and the keyboard & mouse are dead. so i have to either unplug and re-insert the usb-c or open the lid to use the physical power off/on button. this all seems a bit shabby - my previous laptop would work out which monitors were connected and automatically switch them on during power up ? i get the same issues if i ask windows to power off the monitors after inactivity - they never come back on. is this behaviour as designed or a fault / setup issue ? any others experiencing this weird battery behavior? is this a know issue? should i do something about it? how to prevent this from happening again? the most weird thing, is that the laptop has been plugged in all the time, there is no way the battery was draining. i hear white noise in addition to the video\\'s audio when watching a video. i hear a click when either the video goes quiet or i pause the video. this is not caused by my headphones; i have reproduced the issue on multiple headphones. this issue usually occurs at the end of the day, after i have been using my computer for a while. on 12/9/2022 9:20 pm i used dell update to update my audio drivers. it has not fixed the issue. i have disabled audio enhancements in control panel; it has not fixed the issue. any others experiencing this weird battery behavior? is this a know issue? should i do something about it? how to prevent this from happening again? the most weird thing, is that the laptop has been plugged in all the time, there is no way the battery was draining. does someone owns 9320 and use it for data engineering work (sql, pyspark, powerbi)? is that performing well? i\\'m wondering if i should buy this one with i7-1260p/16gb configuration. i\\'m not sure where i did right with my 9550 or where i did wrong with my new 9520, but the audio quality is so different. i tinkled with maxxaudio and other settings again and again, but i just can\\'t make my 9520 sound like my old 9550. anyone else experiencing similar things? hi, recently, i updated the bios on my dell 9720 with core i9 12900hk from 1.11.0 to 1.12.0 and found that the voltage offsets specified through throttlestop were not applied. intel xtu also wasn\\'t able to adjust voltages. it showed the undervolt protection error. this situation usually occurs when certain memory areas (0x150 msr) are locked and marked as read-only. i\\'ve double-checked the virtualization settings (memory integrity, hyper-v, etc.) and even tried to disable the virtualization support in bios, but the voltage offsets still were not applied. later i tried to update bios to 1.13.1 and reset bios settings, but the issue was still in place. additionally, i\\'ve checked the overclocking lock and cfg lock settings in bios and double-checked if their offsets are the same. ultimately, i solved this issue by downgrading bios to 1.11.0. now i want to clarify if it is related to the bios firmware by itself or if there are issues between my windows setup and the new bios. has anyone experienced the same problem after bios upgrade to 1.12.0 or 1.13.1? thank you! i was getting various not-working to half-working (half squished screen) display results on my monitor* via hdmi, trying various hdmi-to-usb-c adapters/hubs on my xps 13 plus. my monitor is the samsung ultrawide g9 --so maybe less of an issue for those with a smaller, less demanding monitor. anyhow, what finally worked for me was changing the refresh rate from 60hz to 59.98hz (yours could be 59.94hz) in the windows display->advanced display settings. i knew the refresh rate was there but i would have

just had to restore my windows 11 using a prevous image. i have 32gb factory-installed ram, with 31.7 gb reported as usable in windows. i know that windows always holds a little bit, but for some reason i \"thought\" that mine was 31.9 gb prior to the restore. that is what my desktop reports too. if someone on here with similar configuration can confirm whether 31.7gb is correct, or if i have an issue or need to do something to minimize system reserved memory? thanks. i have a dell xps 13 9310 laptop and the stupid thing only has two usb c ports! nothing more than that.... but i suspect most companies are going this route bug idk of course. any between all the annoying dongles and adapters, the freakin usb c ports have gotten all loose and usb sticks fall out sometimes partially sometimes all the way. it\\'s so difficult to use anything that requires usb c now. i mean i can obviously have the ports changed, but then i would have to keep doing so. any idea to help alleviate this some? is this common with dell laptops? thanks i\\'m not sure where i did right with my 9550 or where i did wrong with my new 9520, but the audio quality is so different. i tinkled with maxxaudio and other settings again and again, but i just can\\'t make my 9520 sound like my old 9550. anyone else experiencing similar things? i was getting various not-working to half-working (half squished screen) display results on my monitor* via hdmi, trying various hdmi-to-usb-c adapters/hubs on my xps 13 plus. my monitor is the samsung ultrawide g9 --so maybe less of an issue for those with a smaller, less demanding monitor. anyhow, what finally worked for me was changing the refresh rate from 60hz to 59.98hz (yours could be 59.94hz) in the windows display->advanced display settings. i knew the refresh rate was there but i would have naturally ignored the very similar refresh rate as the thing to try. \\u200b hopefully if someone has similar issue it saves them from trying different graphics adapter drivers and monitor settings. hey. i just wanted to come on here to confirm something and hopefully find some answers. it\\'s the first time i\\'m gaming on the xps and the moment i load into the overwatch practice range, the fans just whir to life at what seems like full speed. i get that the increased load on the gpu and cpu can cause this but even if i\\'m on a well ventilated area this still happens and it happens for quite a long time without stopping. is this a normal occurrence for other users or is this an issue that needs to be personally resolved? evening, has anybody tired to run an xps 13 9310 while using one of these?

does it run the laptop and just as importantly does it allow the charger to charge the battery? hi, i\\'ve replaced the stock nvme that came with the laptop. everything works as expected. the issue is the stock nvme that came with the computer (sk hynix pc711 1tb) will not work on other systems or external enclosure. it reports errors and does not work at all, it is as if the drive was busted, but if i put it back the the xps it is working without any issues. already tried to fully clean the drive with gdisk in hoes that would solve the problem, but no luck with it. after sometime searching around the web i can\\'t find info about the drive being factory locked to the computer it self nor any ways to get it working. anyone came across this and was able to solved? thanks anyone have the original wallpapers that came with the xps 9315, like this one? can\\'t seem to find them anywhere! thanks! i am trying to get into the bios on my xps 9310 by pressing f2. i never get the prompt to hit f2 to enter the bios. i tried repeatedly hitting f2 and it just boots normally. if i hit the f2 key at the dell logo it just boots normally. if i hold the f2 key it enters on-board diagnostics. any help would be appreciated. picked up an xps 15 this week and tried to swap out the current drive for a samsung 990 pro. the bios sees the drive but when i attempt to install windows 11 the installer doesn\\'t see the drive. when i attempt to switch raid to ahci mode i click apply and exit, but after reboot the setting is back to raid. is there a trick i\\'m missing to keep the bios in ahci mode so the windows 11 installer can see the drive? hoping someone else here has run into this (or has ideas). thanks! my device was built on october 15th, and the touchpad firmware update from dell is from september, regardless, i have updated in windows the firmware but the tools seems to do nothing, maybe because it is already up to date. \\u200b where can i check in ubuntu or windows the current firmware version for the touchpad? i am using it on a dell xps 13 plus 9320 hi everyone, i\\'ve had my xps 15 for about a year now and over the past month i\\'ve faced an issue where one of my fans run nonstop. from boot to shut down my left-side fan is running at full speed. even when i close the lid and put the system to sleep, the fan runs as if nothing changed. i opened my laptop and cleaned both fans with compressed air to see if it was an issue with dust build up, however that was to no avail. ran full diagnostics, system file checker, even did a wipe of the system and still the issue persists. temporarily i can get the fan to stop if i apply pressure from my hand to the left side of the laptop (my thumb on top of the speaker grill, the rest of my fingers below the air vents), but like i said, it\\'s a temporary fix that lasts a few seconds. i\\'m at my wits end as the fan is so loud and i work 8+ hours a day on my laptop. would greatly appreciate some insight from those in the know, thank you. hello, i have a xps from last year with the following specs that i would like to sell because i got a better one from my work. can anybody tell me what a reasonable price would be for this laptop? it is like new. thanks in advance! ``` dell xps 17 (9710) bought directly from dell on nov 18, 2021 application software additional software item number: 658-bfbo cable us

from september, regardless, i have updated in windows the firmware but the tools seems to do nothing, maybe because it is already up to date. \\u200b where can i check in ubuntu or windows the current firmware version for the touchpad? i am using it on a dell xps 13 plus 9320 it\\'s totally a waste of money. the build quality is really bad it cant even hold on to normal web browsing. it keeps lagging and getting stuck. i am a software developer. i use visual studio most of the time, and it gets stuck while debugging every time. i have to use my old i7 10th gen laptop from asus. i just got a brand new dell xps 15 9520, and i noticed that with an idle temp around 40c, there is a slight blanket of warmth that comes off the keys. i\\'m unsure if this is normal for an xps? hi, my xps 9710 takes 16 seconds to boot up from the point i turn it on to my desktop. i turned off fast startup with the understanding that due to using an ssd, this should add at most a few seconds. however, startup now takes 1:45 seconds. i\\'ve tested this several times and am not sure why such a significant difference exists. bios time is similar in both cases (8.2 seconds). windows and all drivers are up to date (via dell command). any ideas what could be wrong? dell website no longer has it available for download, thank you when i run v4l2-ctl --list-devices, i get: ipu6 (pci:pci0000:00): /dev/media0 intel mipi camera (platform:v4l2loopback-000) /dev/video0 none of them work when i try to setup howdy or configure the ir emitter with the linux-enable-ir-emitter tool. when i run v4l2-ctl

linux-enable-ir-emitter tool. dell website no longer has it available for download, thank you as the title suggests i\\'m just about to purchase the i9 64gb ram version of this machine. i\\'m not sure which of the displays to go with thought, it\\'s either going to be the 3.5k oled or the uhd+. i\\'m not a gamer - i\\'m mainly going to be writing code on it i may play the occasional game from time to time. i\\'m not sure i need the oled but they do look cool, any advice would be helpful. also does anyone know if dell (uk) are planning to have a sale any time soon - i may just wait for that before buying, i know the 13th gen processors are on their way soon but not sure i want to wait for them to filter their way through. thanks in advance i need to break it to you, but that looks like a sketchy/failing gpu. either that or windows crashed hard looking at the wd19tb, it says it only supports up to 60hz, but other places online say that it can support up to 120hz. would a 1080p at 120hz be supported using an xps 9520? what about a 1440p at 120hz? i have a 4-yead old xps 13 9360, and have been pretty happy with it. but its battery is pretty much dead, and thought i\\'d take the opportunity to replace it. i like the look of the new xps 13 9315, and am considering the i7 model with 16gb ram, 512gb ssd and non-touch screen. but having done some research online, i\\'m concerned about all the stories about poor dell build quality. while i\\'ve had a good run with my current xps, my previous dell (an inspiron) had plenty of issues; and it seems like newer the xps models aren\\'t that well-built? am i over thinking? as titled i wanted to upgrade the ssd of my dell xps 13 9320 to a larger + faster model, so i purchased and installed a western digital black 4tb nvme ssd. after installing the new ssd, the machine boots perfectly, but the haptic trackpad no longer works correctly. it behaves almost as if one of the buttons is now permanently depressed / clicked; the cursor will highlight all the desktop icons as i try to move the cursor, and it displays the little selection rectangle when i am not clicking buttons / pressing on the pad, but merely swiping my finger around to move the cursor. not sure if it matters but the new ssd is double-sided, whereas the oem (ironically was also western digital!) was single-sided. it seems to fit a bit more snugly in there, that’s for sure… i used macrium reflect to clone the old ssd onto the new one. eta: the reason i mention this is; obviously the xps is a very slim laptop. it seems the double-sided ssd might not allow the bottom cover to fully & completely re-seat / snap in. i\\'m still researching & working with it, but i could very well see the added thickness of the double vs. single-sided ssd interfering with some of the plastic hooks / snaps that help seat the bottom cover. i\\'m not sure if that could have any impact on the touchpad; helping keep the cables seated; if there is some capacitive connector that needs to be connected for the touchpad to work (almost like apple\\'s smart connector), etc. i don\\'t know what i don\\'t know, so i am mentioning what has changed. anyhow; after cloning & installing the new 4tb wd black 850x ssd, the machine booted right up perfectly, zero issues with the new drive after the clone. i was thrilled! that said; the physical ssd install itself was very simple and easy as you can see here in the service manual i followed, but when i put it all back together the touchpad no longer works normally. service manual: https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-13-9320-laptop/xps-13-9320-service-manual/working-inside-your-computer?guid=guid-dd3ae169-a824-4f1d-832e-585b176f6faf&lang=en-us the touchpad does kind of work, but it acts like one of the buttons is stuck, as the cursor just selects everything as i move it around, just like if you were holding down one of the buttons / clicking & dragging. i have already uninstalled & reinstalled the driver; no luck. i have also disconnected & firmly re-seated the touchpad cable, as identified in the service manual; no help. i just got a $75 ifixit tool kit, so i’ve got the proper equipment to carefully disconnect / re-connect those tiny little ribbon cables / connectors… when i boot into the bios, the touchpad does seem to work normally when moving around in the bios, so that’s encouraging. any ideas? hello i recently bought an xps 13 9315. when it arrived, it quickly failed due to a ec power rail failure. i got it serviced by a dell techinician, who replaced the motherboard. now i am having extreme difficulty with the os recovery system. my laptop will not connect to my local network because it wont find the ip address. i tried getting a usb with windows on it from dell, at the advice of my technician, but i cant figure out how to use that. any help troubling shooting the problem would be much appreciated, thank you. i own a dell xps 15 9520, and i charge it daily with a belkin dual port 63w charger. my goal was to carry to university a single charger for my laptop, ipad and iphone. the charger can supply 60w on one port or 18w+45w when using both ports. the laptop does charge at 60w (although showing a slow charger warning), but when using both ports (45w), it randomly stops charging and start charging again, which i guess it’s not good for the laptop. i heard that the max charging rate you can achieve in an xps over pd is 90w, and that some 100w chargers are capped at 60w as they can 100w but not 90w. i was looking for a gan charger that can charge the xps at 90w, while also having multiple ports. what has your experience been with the xps and third-party pd chargers? any charger suggestions? i noticed my 4 month old laptop wasn\\'t charging a few days ago. i\\'ve been using a satechi 100w charger that has been working fine. now, even the oem charger doesn\\'t work. battery looked fine and isn\\'t bulging. has anyone had this issue? my laptop is stuck at 3%, so i can\\'t even update the bios. following advice from other threads/forums, i\\'ve tried unplugging the battery and holding the power button for 30s and 1 minute. i\\'m emailing support right now, but it looks like it\\'s going to have to be sent back for battery replacement. \\u200b initially, it said battery not installed, but i unplugged the battery and plugged it back in. it\\'s essentially running on ac power right now. \\u200b edit: that was fast. support will be sending out a technician for on-site replacement within 3 business days tomorrow. hopefully, the battery was just a fluke. i installed ubuntu 22.04 on dell xps 15 9520 (2022 model), but i immediately noticed some wifi issues that occurred randomly when loading web pages that took longer than normal and more noticeably when doing meeting using google meet or zoom (for example the video and audio of the other participants sometimes goes out of sync). \\u200b as suggested in other posts i disabled wifi power save by editing /etc/networkmanager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf but didn\\'t work [connection] wifi.powersave = 2 next, i installed ubuntu 22.10 which has a newer kernel (5.19) hoping this issues would be fixed. this helped and the wifi seem more stable, but from time to time it happens again. \\u200b some information about my

hi guys, after telling myself that i will never buy dell product, considering how much hassle and qc issues i had with the xps 13 9300 and dells poor customer service, i couldn\\'t resist and purchased the xps 13 9320 plus - white edition , i7, 32gb, 1tb, fhd touch. just wanna lay down some things i\\'m experiencing after opening it and running it for a day. it might help someone with the purchase decision. touchbar feels alright i would still prefer physical buttons but so far i don\\'t hate it don\\'t love it. i really like the high brightness of it, its very well visible even with white version of this laptop. keyboard feels great, i got used to it very fast as a previous xps owner you should not have any problems with it. unfortunately, the backlight is catastrophic on white laptop. i opted for the white version bc it was less than 200e cheaper in same specs as the dark one. this was a deal breaker for me. definitely go for dark version! windows 11 bloatware and set up is super freaking long and annoying. i am a big believer in flushing all partitions and installing a fresh copy but so far i avoided doing it only to give it go. at the end of the day after paying 2k+ euro you shouldn\\'t be required to do it at all! touchpad is responsive, probably too responsive. i sometimes end up instead of scrolling with two fingers randomly clicking stuff on the screen. laptop gets warm, you can feel it under your palms that the bottom glass part gets warm which makes it little bit weird. definitely need to get used to it. fhd display looks very nice, i don\\'t recommend opting for 4k. combining this with power hungry cpu you be happy with 3hrs of battery life on regular use. i was able to squeeze around 6 hrs so far, updating, chroming etc. there is definitely potential for more. these are my first impressions, if you have questions feel free to ask. i have to install ubuntu on a windows version of the laptop, i remember seeing somewhere detailed instructions from dell on the different ppa and commands you have to perform to add the dell specific ubuntu drivers, example: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oem-solutions-group/intel-ipu6 hi all, i got a brand new dell xps 15 9520 for christmas as an early “going away” gift for college. after a while of using it, the audio quite literally stopped working, and it looks like either a hardware or driver problem, and i’d like to know if i’m the only one person who’s had this issue, and if it can be common with this laptop or not. i have to install ubuntu on a windows version of the laptop, i remember seeing somewhere detailed instructions from dell on the different ppa and commands you have to perform to add the dell specific ubuntu drivers, example: sudo add-apt-repository

doesn\\'t click back up. this happens a lot and it easily reproducible. this will trigger an rma for me as i dont want to deal with this for 3 years. speakers simply aren\\'t loud enough. as others have reported, the touchpad sometimes \"lags\" and the cursor slows down. coming from a macbook pro, i find i\\'m much less accurate with this touchpad. however, i havent been getting false positives clicks from my palms -- so that\\'s an upgrade from my old xps 15. the usb-c power plug remains super fragile. my old xps broke this way and 5 years later there is no upgrade here. i bought a magsafe adapter immediately to protect the port software on ubuntu 22.04 i\\'ve had the os ui freeze for about 10 seconds on several occasions. no mouse nor keyboard input does anything. the streaming in the background continues playing. after 10 seconds, the machine returns to normal. could be an issue with 22.04, not sure. the ubuntu 22.04 login screen takes longer than it did on my old xps 15. not a huge deal. i have my xps 17 plugged in basically constantly. it\\'s more of an exceptionally mediocre desktop at this point. 5 minutes ago, while plugged in, i was mid-keystroke when suddenly the display turns off. i thought it might\\'ve been my somewhat cheap usb-c dock bugging out and i was just waiting for the display to reconnect, but then i noticed the lights on the keyboard behave in exactly the same way they do when the device goes to sleep, and when i tapped the spacebar a few times, i was greeted with the lock screen. this is just one of the many sleep-related problems i\\'ve been having with this laptop in the year or so since i bought it. if i had the money for a replacement i think i\\'d be considering it pretty strongly right about now... hello. i recently purchased a dell xps 8950 and a western digital black 6tb hard drive. the hard drive makes a noise every 5 seconds. i have come to understand that this noise is the pre-emptive wear leveling feature to reduce hard drive failure. in the xps 8950, the primary hard drive slot is on the top with the hard drive suspended label down. i was wondering if anyone has ideas on how i might lessen this frequent and periodic noise. are there any other hard drive caddies for the xps that might help dampen this noise? thanks in advance. hi all, just got my new xps 15 9520 model and ... to put it simply, for the price, i\\'m a bit disappointed in its performance. i\\'ve googled and searched this topic quite a bit, but it seems to still be an issue on the 15inch. has anyone figured out how to use only the dgpu nvidia in the laptop and not use the integrated graphics from intel iris? it infuriates me because i feel like it\\'s a bait and switch. the \"gpu\" is in the laptop, but it seems everything still has to flow through the iris platform. howdy all! i know dell has had some qc issues with the xps line in the last few years, so i want some input on the laptop i recently received. i am sure i can get it replaced if i insist, but if these issues will persist in the replacement i may not bother, i am hoping other\\'s can chime in on their models and experience. \\u200b around the frame of the laptop, where the carbon fiber meets the metal, it is uneven. left/right on the front and sides. on one side the carbon fiber protrudes beyond the metal, on the other the metal protrudes slightly beyond the carbon fiber. it is significant enough to feel the ridge/bump in the seam with your finger, but you can only see it if you are looking for it. \\u200b also, the carbon fiber around the trackpad is near flush on the left, yet it is slightly raised on the right. the keyboard is slightly humped in the middle too, which i have found others note on previous models. there are other smaller things, like the esc and power keys being slightly lower than the remainder of the keyboard, and the screen not sitting completely flush with the body when closed, but those are less concerning to me. i got a great deal during black friday, which is why it\\'s hard to look at any alternatives, but the retail price of this suggests there shouldn\\'t be so many issues with quality. usb-pd needs signaling to work for high power charging. without agreed usb-pd signaling, it will default to 5w because that\\'s the safe default. anything above that must be negotiated, so that your android phone etc doesn\\'t go bang when you plug it into a usb-pd charger. i\\'d start by saying use the right usb-c cable but i suppose you\\'ve already done that. if the right cable is in use and it still won\\'t power the laptop it probably is the charger that\\'s failed. anyone had success with this? or at least know the answer to whether it\\'s muxed or muxless? bonus: do you have a current/recent source for accomplishing this? i\\'m reading this one from 2018 and i\\'m not sure how relevant it is or if it\\'s even possible https://gist.github.com/misairu-g/616f7b2756c488148b7309addc940b28 hey, i\\'ve read a lot about why the new xps 15 has problems with battery consumption during sleep mode. anything i should be aware of? i\\'m looking into buying a xps 15 9520 hi, i love my 9360, but i feel like it\\'s time for an upgrade after almost 7 years. looking to see if any of the og xps 13 owners (9343/9350/9360/etc.) have made a jump to a newer xps 13 (9305/9310) models and how your experience is? to be clear, i am not talking about the xps 13 plus model. i have read the cheaper xps 13 9305 model is very similar to the og devices, but not sure in terms of trackpad size, keyboard, etc. anyone who made a similar jump and can share your feedback would be super appreciated! thanks! i have a 4k laptop - dell xps 15 9510 [4k] - which meets all requirements for netflix 4k playback; but have learned that 4k playback doesn\\'t just happen out of the box. i bought the windows hevc extension which is what seems to be necessary for this- but netflix (both on microsoft edge and on the windows app) are now only displaying the hdr logo, rather than 4k & hdr, like it would on my amazon fire stick. i am also on the (netflix) premium ultra hd plan and have set my playback to best quality to ensure that it defaults to 4k. what\\'s weird is that some titles are indeed now streaming in 4k resolution (which i can see from keying in ctrl+alt+shift+d), but then others which should be streaming in 4k are at standard hd. really getting frustrated at this point, as one of the reasons i bought this laptop was to watch 4k content. any help would be really appreciated 🙏. update: seems to actually play all 4k content at 4k resolution after a few minutes. no 4k logo though, which is strange. howdy all! i know dell has had some qc issues with the xps line in the last few years, so i want some input on the laptop i recently received. i am sure i can get it replaced if i insist, but if these issues will persist in the replacement i may not bother, i am hoping other\\'s can chime in on their

(https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-memory-upgrade-32gb-2rx8-ddr5-sodimm-4800mhz-ecc/apd/ac258276/memory). dell couldn\\'t really answer this question for me so i figure that someone in the community might know. thanks for any help guys \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/56p17zk4eq7a1.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=79692b860c87992eb8fe1fc6154220b162f5cb64 i have a 9710. still under warranty. i am pretty good at keeping everything updated. for the past year, i literally cannot use sleep or hibernate, and even turning the system on is iffy. i contacted dell support, they had me do a wipe to base. it worked great at first, and then i made the mistake of updating the firmware. anyone else with similar issues? any hints or tips? i’m just tired of having to hold down the power button for 15 seconds every time i want to use my laptop. as the object, my laptop discharges while using an external display with usb-dp while being under charge concurrently. does anyone have a solution? also, the external monitor is recognized with the right resolution 3440*1440 only when using the usb-dp, and is recognized as a 2560*1080 with hdmi. edit: i mean it is under charge with its original 130 w charger. i made a post before about it, but still no luck fixing it. is this normal for every other 9720 user? the ends of my keyboard is cool, but the middle and spacebar isnt. i use the cool mode, it works but the fan noise from that drives me insane and im worried that it might destroy my fans. i\\'ve just noticed 3 critical driver updates just in time for the holidays. support for xps 15 9520 | drivers & downloads once again, the dell update app, the supportassist app, and the dell support website all tell me i have no updates needed but device manager tells me otherwise (my machine is weird with this). happy holidays everyone. wishing you all a safe and stress-free festive season. cheers. since clean installing windows 11 on my xps 9315, fan control has been odd, with the fan spinning like crazy when connected to ac (maybe battery cooling? but it doesn\\'t make sense). or spinning loudly on startup and then going silent in 2-5 minutes. just me? hi all ! i\\'m doing a survey for xps 17 9720 owners on the laptop design. i recently bought the i9 12900hk version (2 weeks back) and the laptop can not be placed on the bed or lap or anywhere else apart from the desk. why ? the vents below the laptop get blocked and the laptop starts to heat up and starts to thermal throttle. even with nothing open other than 1 edge browser tab, under quiet and cool modes, the laptop starts to lag and fan constantly spins making noise and heats up on the bottom. this does not happen as intensely and frequently in optimized / ultra performance mode but occasionally, although the fan noise is always very auditable and loud and the bottom portion heats up like crazy. on hwinfo i see max cpu temps reaching about 106 degree c. so my question to you all : 1) do you have the same problem on i7 12700h when placed on bed or non flat surface ? do you have the same problem with i9 12900hk ? 2) if yes, how do you deal with this problem ? given it\\'s a laptop, it is unreasonable to always keep it on the desk and never use on the lap or bed or other locations. i\\'m a dell xps 9710 owner -- i forgot about my warranty expiration date and when i go to dell.com/support -- i don\\'t see an option to extend my warranty. there is also no option to chat with a rep either. its about a month or two since it expired -- is it possible to extend it by reaching out to dell by phone/email? since laptop is expensive, it would be ideal to have warranty for repair or for accidental damage... would have to pay out of pocket for any of those without warranty. anyone have luck going this route, if dell will budget..shame warranty period is so short hi all, i got a xps 13 for work and originally wanted to put fedora on it and use it for some docker containers, but getting the drivers to work was a royal pain in the ass. i gave up, attempted to use the bios reset tool, but after letting it run for hours, it failed. i tried installing windows, but i couldn\\'t get the dell drivers on it, and the command center tool won\\'t acknowledge the machine. very frustrating. all i want to do is reset the damn thing. is there an iso out there i can download? anything at all? looking for your thoughts and experiences here. just had my 1.5 year old xps 13 9310 totally quit on me (wtf). ram/memory failure. indicator flashes amber x2, white x4. ram is built into the board, can’t replace. tried disconnecting the battery, didn’t work. it was working fine the night before, and sees very light use and great care. the warranty expired 6 months ago. 🤬 here are my options, as far as i know: the cost of replacing the whole board might be half the cost of a new laptop. through dell’s diagnostics that it pulled up, it says i can do ‘mail in service’ for $123. is that just for them to look at it? and then parts and labor after it’s diagnosed on top of that? extend my warranty. i can extend for $177 ish for 1 year, or another option was about $17/month. would they really let me buy one month of warranty and get the whole thing fixed for $17? it was an 1100 dollar laptop. my inspiron 15 gtx from like 5 years ago is still going strong, with heavier use and gaming. lesson learned on laptops without replaceable ram cards. i thought the xps was supposed to be better build quality. thanks for your time and input friends. my brand new dell xps 15 9520 arrived a few days ago, and i haven\\'t been able to get acceptable audio with it at any point. i first noticed that my external headphones/speakers using the 3.5mm jack sounded processed with a lot of harsh high-end frequencies (compared to any other laptop or audio source for the same audio files), which i\\'ve realized is from waves maxxaudio, based on several past posts. turning everything to \"off\" in the maxxaudio interface still does not produce the raw audio sound. i tried installing different versions of audio drivers per other posts i\\'d seen, and i now can get 3 different audio setups that all partially work and are partially broken: using realtek\\'s audio driver 6.0.9369.1 (from 6/21/2022) or 6.0.9430.1 (from 10/25/2022) (and reinstalling the waves maxxaudio driver here by following this workaround here, if i\\'d previously removed it): with these default drivers, the sound through any headphones or external speakers ends up sounding processed and harsh (with more high end frequencies), as mentioned before. but the built-in laptop speakers sound okay. i tried disabling the waves and realtek services per this post and related script on github here. this worked for a brief moment, where internal and external audio sounded right. however, then detecting headphones in the 3.5mm jack would subsequently stop working (if unplugged and plugged back in), so only built-in speakers would be usable sadly. i also tried turning off \"audio enhancements\" for the external speakers via the windows sound options, but then audio stops completely for the external headphones/speakers. using microsoft\\'s \"high definition audio device\" driver 10.0.22621.608: with this driver, any headphones or external speakers sound normal/unprocessed/working. however, the built-in laptop speakers then sound absolutely terrible and tinny, with no low-end bass frequencies whatsoever, while also being quieter and having really harsh high-end frequencies. i tried installing this driver based on this audio thread, where others had noticed annoying processed sound for their audio. using this open-source realtek generic uad driver: i was able to install these drivers, and external headphones/speakers sounded good/unprocessed. however, volume controls ended up not working properly when using built-in speakers: decreasing the system volume level would end up making the sound more and more muffled, but it wouldn\\'t significantly reduce the loudness, where even very low levels (like level 2 out of 100) would be fairly loud. reducing an individual application\\'s volume would work/sound fine, as long as system volume was up all the way, but that\\'s not very practical. none of the above seems reasonable. does anyone know if there\\'s anything that can be done to get both my built-in laptop speakers and external headphones/speakers working properly? thank you in advance! (dell technical support says they\\'ll let me exchange the laptop for a new one since, but i have very little confidence that a new one will be any different.) (cross-posted from the dell forums here.) hey all, long time lurker, first time poster here. recently, i\\'ve been looking at a new computer as an upgrade from my older dell precision t7610. started looking around at costco and found an awesome deal on an xps 8950. i7-12700, 32gb ddr5, 750w psu, rx 6700 xt, 512gb ssd, and a 1tb storage drive. \\u200b it\\'s supposed to arrive friday, and i can\\'t wait for it. hey everyone, tldr : looking to upgrade base model 9520 to make it a gaming pc recently, i made the mistake of purchasing the base model dell xps 15 9520. to be fair, it was at a great price and was the clear winner in my budget. after looking at a few options online, i decided that i am going to purchase crucial\\'s ram - crucial 16gb kit (2 x 8gb) ddr5-4800 sodimm. i am trying to maximize its performance, i\\'m actually very happy with the design and feel of the laptop. coming from a macbook air 2015, this feels like a powerful machine. current specification - https://preview.redd.it/g5er0kwhk67a1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0784c87928d44a9bd6f3bdafc6e3d89943522d9 has no dedicated graphic cards either, i looked into some egpus but i don\\'t think that\\'s compatible. i\\'m fairly new to trying to upgrade my laptop manually, but i am looking for any and all suggestions. thanks :) what the title says. i see in the dell drivers page that i can only select drivers for windows 11/ubuntu for my device. so i wonder what will happen if i install windows 10. sorry if this is a stupid question. i\\'m not much of a tech person the arrangement of some the pixels are weird. (u have to look closely in order to see it in the photo, it\\'s quite obvious irl. on the pointer u can see it the best.) first i thought it was a technical error and requested a replacement. but then i got the \"new\" one and had the same issue. like the titel says, is this normal or do i just buy another ultrabook? https://imgur.com/a/n7w6ehh https://www.dell.com/community/xps/xps-13-9310-charge-light-blinks/td-p/7841376 i have an xps 13 (9310), would it be compatible with the d3100 dock? it\\'s not one of the computers listed under compatibility. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/dellxps/comments/z8ctxm/ic_diamand_pump_out_on_a_9710_anyone_here_try/ so i ordered some \"ptm7950\" from aliexpress (160mmx100mmx2mm sheet) despite my concerns that it may have been a counterfeit product. still not entirely sure if its the real deal but it performs well enough so far. there are other products under the ptm6000 and ptm7000 series from honeywell that could have been easily swapped and listed online as ptm7950. anyways, replaced the ic diamond that was 3 weeks old with this stuff (was already seeing some slight pump out of the paste). used a utility knife with a ruler and a glass surface to cut nice clean pads and applied them. was pretty quick and easy and a hell lot less messy compared to paste. overall, temps seemed to have improved a bit. its not a massive amount compared the the fresh ic diamond but was massively better than the 10 month old application that pumped out. needless to say its also much better than what the original crap dell shipped with it (the whole reason why i repasted with ic diamond in the first place). i\\'ll redo these tests in 6 months and a year and see if the paste holds up. if not, ill bust it open and see how pumped out it gets. whenever i launch games, my screen constantly glitches (see image). i have to minimize the game to stop it but it keeps coming back every few minutes. i’m going to fix it in 3 weeks or so because i’m still overseas but i’d like to know if anyone is facing the same issue check if it goes into deep sleep with sudo cat /sys/power/mem_sleep. see also https://www.dell.com/community/xps/xps-13-9310-ubuntu-deep-sleep-missing/td-p/7734008 i don\\'t think ubuntu supports face unlock out of the box but you could try something like this: https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy no issues so far. maybe 2-4% usage over night. hello, i sadly broke the screen on my xps 13 9320 today because i got into a bicycle accident while carrying it in my backpack (i\\'m fine). my problem is that i cannot find any replacement parts whatsoever for this model of xps. does anyone know of any source for these hard-to-come-by parts? if it helps i\\'m located in germany. thanks in advance! hi, unfortunately for the past week or so my laptop\\'s fan has started to really malfunction, and i am wondering what the best option is to fix it. if replacement parts are available and there is a low chance of me breaking my laptop then i am not against figuring out how to do it myself, but if it isn\\'t expensive i would rather send it in if that\\'s an option. first time trying to repair an issue like this so i am pretty inexperienced... here are some details if it helps: so like other people the laptop has some odd behavior of the fans revving up at times which i guess is it either dumping heat or responding to some process, i don\\'t know. the issue comes in when the fan reaches some rpm and it starts to click and buzz strangely and then just sounds like a lawnmower. this makes me think it isn\\'t a foreign object stuck in the fan since the issue isn\\'t present at lower rpm, but i am not sure. i guess maybe the fan is loose and is shaking itself at higher rpm, but again i don\\'t know for sure. it\\'s very loud and sometimes the laptop\\'s diagnostics flag a problem with the fan and at other times it doesn\\'t. tldr: fan malfunction, want to know if i should fix it or not. it is meant to work if you mess about with drivers. i couldn\\'t get it to though. https://www.dell.com/community/linux-developer-systems/dell-xps-9310-ubuntu-22-04-fingerprint-not-working/td-p/8194742 you can install howdy. that worked. not as nice as hello but functional. https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy fwiw, i\\'m running an xps-9320 (i7/1tb/32gb/3.5k oled) with a recent kubuntu nightly and a bleeding-edge kernel (linus\\' master branch from today) and although dell (at the behest of microsoft, apparently) removed s3 so no longer available, the s0ix improvements in recent kernels seems to indicate after a day of use that the battery drain is about the same as s3 is on my xps-7390 2-in-1 (which wasn\\'t really that great either, losing 2-4%/hr). my 7390 is dying and i\\'m still trying to decide if i want this 9320; i know for sure i\\'m ditching this 3.5k screen though). ping me in a couple of days. you can try with fwupdmgr get-updates and if you touchpad is listed there with fwupdmgr update you will update any firmware mentioned. i did it periodically with dell bios and works well. never done with peripheral firmware. i don\\'t think you are asking the right question. you\\'re asking if the hardware on your dell will run a windows application on a linux distribution? i think the short answer to that question is no. now, if you are asking if ubuntu has a linux application that works like windows hello using the camera on your system, i am not aware of one. however, ubuntu isn\\'t the linux distribution i run so it is possible there may be. you\\'ll have to do a bit of googling. edit: everyone commenting here is using the one without a dgpu, and using it in ubuntu. can anyone comment on the experience with a version with a dgpu on a non-ubuntu distro? thanks for the replies! can someone who actually owns this and runs linux on it comment on whether everything is fully functional? i want to run arch, and the main concerns are: sleep/wake functionality brightness keys speakers trackpad gpu stays off unless required, and can be completely disabled if desired is there any reason i can\\'t use this ram and use only 1 stick for easy upgrade at later date if ever needed? crucial ram 32gb ddr5 4800mhz cl40 laptop memory ct32g48c40s5 both are refurbished through bestbuy marketplace sellers, and are listed at the same price. i5 , fhd+ with integrated graphics i7 , 3456x2160 with a 3050ti will be using it for college software dev and networking. anyone got first-hand experience with these models and can recommend either? i\\'ve seen some reviews of the i7, with people saying the high resolution is a non-factor on a small screen, and the battery life is more limited as well. i had a similar problem with another key. it disappeared in a few weeks. what is this maxxaudio pro, on my xps 9510? it pops up whenever i plug in my earbuds and makes my music sound absolutely terrible. like genuinely. it also seems difficult to fully disable or remove. is it safe to uninstall it? as is seems to be an audio driver, and important for the external speakers. update: in case anyone has the same issue, you can disable headphone enhancements without affecting the external speakers, in: settings > system > headphones > audio enhancements > off. i am trying to decide between the following two laptops based on the following: laptop is for a parent and will be used for basic web browsing, email, google docs, printing, and that is about it. feature longevity over a performance powerhouse (aka better ports, wi-fi, etc. support for the long-term) dell xps 13 laptop $849.00

external screen, mouse and keyboard. because if this i leave the lid closed a lot but it gets quite toasty. i noticed that it has a rear fan, that is sort of angled down, when the lid is closed. if i put it in one of those little vertical stands with the fan at the top, would this be safe to use? was thinking about this product (amazon link) i don\\'t want to kill it with heat, and this seems like it may help. any thoughts welcome i\\'m not sure i\\'m going to do a good job of explaining this, but whenever i don\\'t actively use my touchpad for more than maybe 5 minutes it goes \"stiff\" and stops being able to be pushed in. the bottom left side of the touchpad is unable to be pressed in, and then my cursor just starts highlighting everything and dragging random things on the screen instead of doing what it should. this is probably a horrible explanation but the only solution i\\'ve found is to turn the touchpad on and off whenever this happens, and this isn\\'t the fix that i want because it\\'s annoying and time-consuming. is there some touchpad setting that i\\'m missing? i haven\\'t messed with the touchpad settings at all since i got my computer, and this touchpad issue has only recently been happening. my xps 17 9720 shipped with windows 11 but i really hate the interface and also want the same env\\'t as my desktop (windows 10) for software compatibility (like 7++ tweaker, autohotkey, and other small software) as i install the same stuff on both and don\\'t want to deal with issues. anyone install windows 10 on it and do you have any issues? i\\'m wondering if there are any dell software requirements to be on windows 11 but i can\\'t imagine it... but also wonder if there are battery life benefits for windows 11. also, most importantly, if i install windows 10 even though it came with windows 11, will the license still work? i have a 9520. i don\\'t think the ax211 is bad at all. i use it with a wi-fi 6 router. when i first got the machine, it would have some network issues but with updated drivers and software, it\\'s come good. the machine will ship with killer intelligence center software installed. inside it, i\\'ve found that if you disable the prioritization engine and auto bandwidth settings, the networking is more stable and has fewer problems with websites. if you update the software, you\\'ll need to disable the settings again (they are often switched back on when you update). ymmv. i believe that there is no antenna for 6e in the 9520 so that\\'s why it\\'s not available. maybe it will be added in next year\\'s version, maybe not. 🤷 hth. context on the heels of a dying gaming laptop, and after mulling it over for a year, i decided to bite the bullet back in july and purchase a dell xps 9520 (15 inch, 32gb ram, nvidia rtx 3050 ti), both for regular home use, as well as professional use (as i work almost exclusively from home). i\\'m a software developer who neededed the extra ram for work. purchasing this laptop is one of the worst decisions i have ever made. whilst it\\'s quite a solid piece of hardware with nice build quality, the driver support is just absolutely awful. i have had so many small nagging issues so frequently that it has marred my entire experience with this laptop from day 1. the laptop came with windows 11, which i suspect is responsible (alongside dell\\'s horrible drivers) for at least some of the issues i experience. tldr - anyone looking to buy this laptop who intends to use aux audio output should be very, very wary. audio the primary problem i\\'ve had with this laptop is the audio. i have had so many persistent and disruptive issues with it that i\\'m now at a lose about what to do with this laptop. the audio seems to lean off a horrible piece of bloatware called \"maxxaudiopro\" which is annoying, obnoxious, and by default applies unwanted \"enhancement\" effects to the output. unfortunately, without maxxaudiopro, the laptop can\\'t recognize when headphones have been plugged in. for many months i experienced a consistent issue whereby everytime i connected a usb audio output source (a small dac for music), the laptop would refuse to output audio via speakers or aux until i restarted. even after disconnecting the dac, i\\'d be unable to get audio through another output source without a restart. some research led me to remove the realtek hd audio driver and instead use microsoft\\'s default hd audio drivers to fix this issue. but since then i\\'ve experienced similar random occasional instances of being unable to get audio via earphones without a restart, or being unable to get speaker audio after connecting/disconnecting earphones without a restart, or just flat out losing audio altogether and needing a restart. these happen intermittently and quite frequently, forcing me to restart numerous times throughout any given week, and often interrupting work calls. last week, aux audio output stopped working altogether, prompting me to contact dell support. after following their instructions and installing the latest windows update and audio drivers from dell\\'s website, the speaker audio also stopped working. i since discovered that i had to set the \"audio enhancements\" setting in windows sound settings to \"default effects\" to regain audio. switching \"enhancements\" off results in no audio at all. however, since the dell support incident, the audio quality out of the laptop has been utterly abysmal. muffled, distorted and with a noticeable echo effect. i\\'ve been completely unable to fix this issue, despite numerous attempts. i\\'ve gone through several rounds of uninstalling/reinstalling all the audio drivers and software from dell\\'s website, and attempted other audio drivers from realtek/intel, with varying results: lost audio completely at one stage. interestingly the windows startup sounds still worked. got audio back without forced \"enhancement effects\" but with almost inaudibly low max volume. fixed audio quality for aux port, but speakers only outputted one volume (max volume) regardless of what the volume meter was set to. aux volume selection worked fine. after more uninstalls/reinstalls of the dell driver, i\\'m now back where i was after dell support\\'s \"help\", with clearly malfunctioning and distorted audio quality coming from all output sources, and no audio at all if i switch \"auidio enhancements\" off. a brief search on these issues has turned up numerous results (for each), ranging from years old to recent. it seems i\\'m not alone in encountering persistent issues with dell\\'s audio drivers, and not alone in my revulsion of maxxaudiopro, which these laptops are shackled to. i\\'m baffled that for nearly $4000 aud, i\\'ve received a product that can\\'t functionally provide something as basic as audio. i don\\'t know why dell, after so many years of community issues, can\\'t seem to produce reliable audio drivers. these issues have driven me nearly insane, and constantly interrupt me on a daily basis during work calls and meetings. other issues below i will list, in no particular order, and by no means exhaustively, a smattering of the menagerie of other problems i have had with this laptop: when i wake the laptop from sleep and it\\'s connected to an external display, both displays will experience substantial lag. the solution is to unplug the external display, unplug the charger, and plug both back in. this happens frequently (but not always). occasionally the laptop won\\'t charge when the charger and an external display are plugged in. the solution is again....unplug both, reconnect the charger, then the external display. dell\\'s power management software is broken. the \"always ac\" mode is supposed to stop charging at 80% to preserve battery life. it doesn\\'t. i had to set a custom 50% - 80% setting, which works chaotically. the laptop randomly starts/stops charging anywhere in that range, and sometimes just hovers at a random value (55%, 70%, 75% etc.). it\\'s completely unreliable and requires babysitting, which defeats the entire purpose of the utility even existing. in the 6 months i\\'ve owned this laptop, i\\'ve had two forced bios updates. i used a xps 13 intensively for 3 years and got myself an upgrade in the form of the new xps 13 plus. i really liked the design and still do, but that integrated touchpad is awful. there is absolutely no feedback at all and instead of clicking i\\'m constantly dragging items around instead of moving the pointer. i got myself an extra mouse just to be able to work when i\\'m away from my desk. so... did i got a monday morning laptop or is this a more wide spread problem? have you tried wiping it with a damp cloth, i do have hand natural oils on the regularly used parts of my track pad which took a lot gentle wiping with a damp cloth to remove them, it will come back but nice to give a clean once in a while. hi everyone, i\\'m moving from a low spec chromebook (4gb/64gb, cost £200 2-3 years ago) to an xps 13 plus (16gb/2tb/i7, £1200 certified refurb) and i expected the difference to be night and day.. but honestly the xps feels slow. is this because of windows 11? is chromeos just that much speedier? i\\'m still within the return period and been put off by the persistent sound issues (currently settled by rolling back the drivers but we did that before and it recurred, so the jury is still out). for a laptop that cost more than my car is worth, i expected this computer to feel a bit more premium. i know this could be down to me not being a windows user for the last few years. i\\'m happy to take any advice, but other than removing bloatware (i\\'ve kept dell assist etc. for the constant contact i\\'ve had with support) i haven\\'t seen much useful advice on youtube. reviewers just seemed thrilled with this device. my uses: - vs code (web dev, potentially for android apps) - audacity for voice work and audio editing - makemkv to digitise my media libraries - older games (maybe fable etc.) - i travel a lot, so if i need to return this, i\\'m open to alternatives that are high on portability. tia for any advice. by my research this laptop seemed great for my purposes but i can\\'t get past how slow it is to open programs etc. a restart helps somewhat but should i have to do this with an xps?? the touchbar is a huge disaster, especially the supper-sensitive delete key. horrible idea no mic in skype on either windows 11 or linux mint 21 (all drivers up to date, dual boot) the lack of ports, with the two that are provided requiring a lot of force to insert or remove plugs. the super-smooth case and keyboard, causing constant annoying slippage. the quirky touchpad, which makes it very hard to do what i want. the pathetic battery life for the premium price, i expected a much better experience. hello! i received these critical updates today. do they solve particular issues? have you installed them? seems like a major upgrade. thank you. \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/n9vgtt05za6a1.png?width=1675&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5a147c99a50ac26aec5881feab5c0b72f192c8 was

speechless i need your opinion on the xps 13 plus. i have a deal on my hand for an xps13 plus with an i9 and 1 tb storage for 500€ off. (~1.5k instead of ~2k) i need to write a lot and i love to do so in coffee shops where i sometimes don\\'t have an outlet nearby. so fairly light work with ms word/citavi some browsing and reading pdf-textbooks... does anyone have one and can tell me about the battery life? xps15 9520. windows hello face id take more than 3 seconds on average to unlock. seems a bit longer than i expect. is this normal? hi, i am looking for a protective cover for my new laptop but can\\'t find anything! also, there don\\'t seem to be many companies that make skins. i just want a clear skin that is cut to the laptop dimensions that i can add water to for adherence. are there any germans here that got their hands on a graphite xps 13 plus? it seems to be impossible to find over here, not even configurable on the dell website. after contacting support they sent me an offer for a graphite one, but 2100€ seems like way too much for almost base model config (i7 1260p and 16gb ram, everything else untouched). i just recieved this monday. i think it has something to do with the fans being right in front of the screen. right now its not extremely hot, but definitely warm. im really nervous because i just got this and i dont have many apps on it yet (just chrome, malwarebytes, microsoft office, and adobe. i did have 2 incidents when i was walking to class and to the library where i put it in my computer bag in sleep mode, but the fans were still running for 30 min during that time. did that cause damage to the laptop and is there anyway to carry it around without having to shut it down completely just so it doesnt overheat? utterly uninformative. was it written by a bot? i just recieved this monday. i think it has something to do with the fans being right in front of the screen. right now its not extremely hot, but definitely warm. im really nervous because i just got this and i dont have many apps on it yet (just chrome, malwarebytes, microsoft office, and adobe. i did have 2 incidents when i was walking to class and to the library where i put it in my computer bag in sleep mode, but the fans were still running for 30 min during that time. did that cause damage to the laptop and is there anyway to carry it around without having to shut it down completely just so it doesnt overheat? i heard good things about this new design, i\\'ve never used xpss so i wonder if it\\'s actually good. suddenly, my laptop doesn\\'t turn on when i press the power button. not even a flash. same after 20 seconds. after charging, still nothing. even worse, the light to show the charging won\\'t come on. i don\\'t want to contact dell if i can avoid it. has anyone experienced something similar or knows a solution? i have come across forums with similar problems and so far, and i have tried to - reput the ram - remove battery, hold the power button (20 sec), connect to the power and reconnect the battery \\u200b i don\\'t know much, so if it sounds like my motherboard is fried, please just tell me. thanks in advance i dropped my backpack with my xps 15 9520 inside. i dented the bottom aluminum near the speaker. is there a reliable source to buy a whole new bottom aluminum plate? hello, i\\'ve had my xps 15 for around 3 months and was wondering if anybody could give me tips on improving battery life, its the i7, 16gb ram, 1tb ssd, 4k oled touch model. i know that if i wanted more battery life, i shouldn\\'t have gotten the oled model, but it was the only model in stock and i needed the laptop quickly. i previously posted about the need to manually update some of my 9520\\'s drivers (which some of you also experienced and many of you did not). well it\\'s happened again. this time, my ssd\\'s current firmware (nvme pm9a1 samsung 512gb 3630.8229) is now out of date because 3630.9229 was released on 09 dec. with fixes & enhancements listed as: \"enhanced the stability of the solid state drive (ssd)\". the new firmware is also applicable for 1tb ssds. the dell support website, the supportassist app, and the dell update app all tell me that i have no updates. i\\'ve rebooted and tried it again and they (website and apps) still say no updates are needed. i\\'m not sure where the problem lies but i do wish they would find and fix it. edit: if you run the updater .exe manually, it will tell you that it succeeds but apps like dell update and hwinfo64 will report the older firmware version. it turns out you need to reboot. after rebooting, the updated firmware version is then reported. hth. while gaming i can’t seem to get a constant clock frequency, it never seems to go above 4ghz and fluctuates a lot even tho it’s not overheating. anyone got any tips ? has anyone managed to install the intel processor power management utility from the dell website for a 9315 or similar? it fails when i try it. also failing on a 5330 but worked on a 5420. is this utility worth having? i’m trying to manage the fan noise on my xps, it is surprisingly loud under almost any load. i did a clean install of windows 11 home and installed the drivers from dell support for my dell xps 13 9315. in control panel > hardware and sound > power options the only power plan listed is \"balanced\". how do you your reinstall the default dell power plans? i\\'ve got a xps 9315 with uhd+ with touch screen. i noticed that it looks darker on the top edge of the screen. is this normal? should i return the laptop? hi all, i recently got an xps 13 9310 and installed manjaro (linux distribution based on the arch linux operating system) to dual-boot it alongside windows. somehow surprisingly, almost everything works out of the box. only one major thing remain to be fixed: fingerprint reader - works fine on windows but doesn\\'t work on manjaro. i\\'ve read in a few sources that a driver exists, but i couldn\\'t find it. there were also reports that even if it works, it hardly ever works. does anyone know a fix to this issue? thanks in advance hi, i have used the laptop for over a year now and like it, but i made a poor choice in only having half a tb of storage. i was poking around for leads on how to upgrade storage and saw this video which makes the process seem pretty easy since it includes an extra slot, but i was wondering if anyone knows any common pitfalls i should avoid. also any storage recommendations? do i need a swanky set of tools like he has? thanks i just got my xps 15 9520 a couple of days ago and the night light has been grayed out since day 1. i\\'ve been trying all sorts of fixes i could find online but none of them have worked. does anyone else have this problem? can it be fixed? has anyone discovered how to adjust tension on the lid hinges? the older models had a locknut which could be twisted, but i can\\'t find anything similar on my 9510. i am planning to buy dell xps 15 9520 and can\\'t decide between fhd+ vs. oled/4k screen. i never had glossy screen on laptop, so i am primarily concerned with reflections on oled/4k screens in office environment (sitting by window etc). what\\'s your experience? is there noticeable difference in reflectivity between oled 3.5k vs ips 4k? any photos to share? i have no shop nearby to see it in person... i will be using the laptop plugged in to external monitor 80-90% of time, with laptop as 2nd display, so shorter battery life of oled/4k is not that important for me. currently using laptop with 14\\'\\' 2.5k (1440p) ips matte screen, so going to 15.6\\'\\' with fhd+ feels like a downgrade, but 3.5k/4k glossy could be even worse ;) shame there is no 2.5k-4k matte screen option. edit: most reviews of current xps model are showing the display in dimmed rooms so hard to tell how bad the reflections are. i have seen this one (1) dell xps 15 4k v fhd screen comparison - youtube for older 4k xps model, and those reflections are brutal if sitting by the window, that would be instant no-go for me as i use dark background in text/code editors often. is it still like that? just curious to know how many wattage does 9710 eats when i set to express charge? i know dell charger is 130w.... so express charge push more then 130w tempoarily? or is a long term effect? anyone have the wattage meter to test on? my xps 9710 has a gen 3 ssd. i\\'m considering purchasing a gen 4 2tb ssd for the second slot, and am wondering if i\\'ll be better off installing windows on that. if so, will i need to play the new ssd in slot 1, or can i install windows on it and use it as my primary drive while it remains in slot 2? furthermore, for stuff like windows, browsing, using ms office and pdf (although some are quite large, 6-700mb), will there be any real benefit on replacing the gen 3 ssd with a gen 4 one? (gen 3 will go into slot 2 in that case) does anyone know or have any experience with the realistic battery life on the xps 13 plus on both the fhd+ and oled models? i know the oled model will have a shorter battery life than fhd+, approx 5 hours from what i see. but i can\\'t find any info on how long battery life is for the fhd+ model. appreciate any insight. typing on the xps 15 keyboard, around the center keys the whole keyboard bends inward when typing on it. is this normal? not that big of a deal but it’s pretty annoying so i bought the xps 9315 8gb i5 version. and at some point in the future i\\'ll want to increase the ram due to obvious reasons (i can\\'t keep chrome + two other programs running at a time). so i wanna prepare by gathering information on the ram spare parts (ram part number, max ram accepted into this model, etc.) and the bios resistor config information on when i do decide to solder the new parts. where do i get the information? thank you. hello everybody! i’m using my dell xps 15 9510 with a dell wd19s 130w, docking station. since a few weeks i have the problem that my second screen is flickering and crashing. the problem doesn’t occur if i use a separated hub instead of the docking station, for the screen. on ubuntu not even with the dell docking station. what could cause this problem? i got the recall on my dell xps 13 plus oled due to the faulty double sided tape on the screen. they sent out the replacement but haven’t really followed up to get me to send the previous unit back. kinda feels like i’m going to get away with keeping it. what would you do? the new xps comes with ddr5 4800 mhz. crucial has released new ddr5 sodimm with 5200 mhz and 5600 mhz. previously, the recommended upgrade for the dell xps 9720 was the crucial 4800 mhz ram. with the 5200 and the 5600 now released, will these speeds work with the dell xps 9270? link to the new ram: https://uk.crucial.com/memory/ddr5/ct2k16g56c46s5/ct22356544 i think i am having issues getting the dedicated gpu to turn off. i have battery saver options on and in hwmonitor even when doing nothing it shows power consumption at 14w for the nvidia gpu, core power supply using 6w frame buffer using 2w and 8-pin at 8w. utilisation is at 0 and the little nvidia icon in the lower right shows it as \"inactive\". i even went into the nvidia settings and set preferred processor to intel and tried setting phyx to cpu. no changes. weirdly it consistently shows that i am using 2.9% of the gpu memory. intel gpu shows as 1-10% utilized. i have closed anything open and i am running dell power manager. is this supposed to go to zero if it\\'s truly not used ? my battery life is atrocious currently. i am running a completely clean fresh install of windows 10 entreprise with the latest nvidia studio drivers and the intel drivers also installed. latest bios. cpu shows average consumption around 3-5w and another 2 or 3w for the ia cores. so i think surely my gpu is the culprit here ? i spent a few hours yesterday and was able to bring my average battery consumption down from ~45 watts to ~15 watts. is any further reduction possible? i removed all bloatware from dell and nvidia and set the preferred gpu to integrated. machine config - dell xps 9720, 17 inch 4k touchscreen, rtx 3060, intel i7 alderlake, 16 gb ram, 1 tb ssd got open box from bestbuy for $1800. battery capacity is at 90wh which is about 95% of original capacity. so hopefully i get 90/15 = 6 hours of battery life. review: the 2022 dell xps 13 is more than just a pretty face [ars technica] notable quotes: \"battery is \"built in to the laptop\" and \"not replaceable by the consumer\"\" \"1920×1200 max resolution, 13.4-inch ... (169 pixels per inch).\" \"strong display and surprisingly performant speakers\" \"thin and light\" \"it only has two usb-c ports\" \"it\\'s an improved xps 13.\" it wasnt always like this before, idk what happened but now my game run 60+ fps on battery and run below that when i am plugged in. the games in question include fifa23 and god of war 2018. once i am running the game plugged in, its a bit shaky, moment i unplug boom, smooth as butter. my specs are rtx 3050 ti, 16gb ram, windows 11, core i7 11th gen. its an xps 9510 is there a way to set performance behaviour like how it is on windows 10? (better battery, best battery, better performance etc)... side note, i\\'m set to max performance, turbo boost on, everything max out. rofl, 2.5k for that are you srs so i want to throw a second ssd into my dell xps 9510 but the dell specs are a bit all over the place. some sections say it has two 2280 sized slots while others say one 2280 and one 2230. reading forum posts it sounds like it indeed has two 2280 and that perhaps the wifi card is in a third slot which is the smaller 2230? the dell specs also consistently state that slot 2 has a max ssd size of 256gb. i see many people buying larger ssds though and putting them in - can anyone confirm that the laptop does indeed have two 2280 sized slots and if both can accommodate larger than 256gb drives ? i suspect that this spec may also be for the 2230 slot that the wifi chip occupies. my laptop came with a 512gb drive and i want to throw in a 2tb drive into the secondary. i have heard the crucial p31 drive runs cool so i am leaning toward that. i know i also need to buy a second thermal pad from dell (they are currently out of stock) and for anyone in the same boat the part numbers are 3jjdg and 6n16 (make sure you buy the correct side as they are different). each thermal plate costs 1.99$ plus tax and shipping is free. they do not come with the necessary screw to attach the ssd so you may need to buy that as well or somewhere else - still way cheaper than buying a third party one however for 20$ amazon. in summary for the dell 9510: is anybody running two 2280 size ssd and both larger than 256gb? does anybody know if both slots are pcie gen 4 compatible ? should i go with a gen 3 for lower heat or is that concern overblown ? my dell xps 9315 that i bought a week or two ago has no problems until yesterday. when i closed a heavy load game, my xps would constantly heat up while charging and the fans aren\\'t loud but i can hear them quite clearly. tho the bottom of the laptop is just warm not hot. thing is i opened one or two heavy load application several times over the time period between when i bought the laptop and yesterday and this didn\\'t happen then at all till yesterday. any solutions? or it\\'s maybe just me being overdramatic because of using macbooks all my life until now. follow up to this post - https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/y4zxl7/comment/ivci72k/?context=3 \\u200b the new audio driver that pushed a few days ago seems to have fixed the audio problems and the volume is now normal. however, recipients of my discord and teams calls are now complaining of significant audio artifacts from the built-in microphone and it is unuseable. any others with this issue? i just ordered an xps 8950 with an intel i9 12900, rtx 3080, 32 gb ddr5 ram, and a 2 tb m.2 ssd. so it’s not fully maxed out, but it’s up there. i added the optional liquid cooling, but i have heard that it will still have serious cooling issues that can affect performance. it should be fine for now, but i eventually just want to put it in a new case with custom liquid cooling. how difficult would it be to switch all of my components to a new motherboard, and hook it up to a new power supply inside a new case? is the gpu compatible with non-dell motherboards? yesterday i got my brand new xps 17 leptop and i started updating it before i installed anything else. first i updated windows 11 and then moved to dell\\'s update tool. i had 6 updates in the queue including one bios update and one graphic drivers update and an update for the update tool itself. i left the leptop unattended for a moment and when i came back the screen was turned off and when i checked the progress the update was frozen. after closing a different window to check if the system is responsive, the screen went black with only the cursor visible and everything frozen. after waiting for a while i had to force a shutdown because nothing was responding. after windows loaded i could only see one update available in dell\\'s tool and it was for bios. on the left hand side, i saw \"never\" as the last time an update was applied. later i realised that by default windows hibernates the laptop after 3 minutes. not the best thing to happen once you install drivers... this has caused my issue. what should i do now? can i check what sort of dell\\'s updates were installed? should i just continue using the laptop? i\\'d like to avoid wiping it to the factory settings... i\\'m testing xps 13 plus with oled right now (so resolution 3456x2160) at display scale of 165%, smallest text size. if i were to pick fhd instead (resolution 1920x1200), to save on battery and avoid babying oled, i could not get the level of font size i\\'m currently using right? in other words, with resolution at 3456x2160, to test what smallest fonts look like on fhd at 1920x1200, since 3456x2160/1920x1200 = 1.8, i test the oled with display scale at 180%, right? (feels like a dumb question but gotta check my stupidity when considering things i don\\'t normally consider~) i\\'m kind of surprised the oled and fhd options have such a big resolution difference. my main use is within windows terminal, though i can avoid using the display when not travelling a lot since i have an external monitor. also, for oled, a lot of people hide the taskbar to avoid possible burn in. what about the top menu/tab bar in most applications? the only thing i found was dark mode to change the top bar color. i can\\'t seem to google much on that, most ppl just mention taskbar. thanks in advance! i have dell xps 9710, fan noise reach 62 dba while i\\'m watching youtube video windows 10, everything is uptodate. i\\'m tired please help me my xps 13 9305 that i bought back in june (2022) has blue screened twice in 3 days. the screen only stays up for a few seconds and then the machine restarts however it is not the kind of behaviour i would expect from an effectively brand new machine. as a fairly tech savvy person i\\'m quite comfortable with fixing the issue myself however some pointers on where i should start looking for a fix or even some pointers on what the problem could be would be much appreciated. 👍 i installed raid drivers via windows 11 clean install, the ssd drives showed up, and i installed windows. then when setup rebooted i kept getting bluescreens. in bios i turned raid to ahci mode and windows booted up... however i maybe having speed issues... the dell out of box install with oem wd sn810 512gb drive was crystaldiskmark speed testing at 6300mb/s. now my new sk hynix p41 is only reaching 5,300mb/s with clean install on ahci, others are hitting 7,300mb/s. i am going to try and turn on raid mode, install more drivers, etc, i want the 7,300mb/s speed! any advise? i will follow up if i figure it out. how does windows 11 sleep? for some reason after i put my new xps to sleep, rather than starting from the lockscreen, it starts from the dell logo. it does start from the lockscreen if its been in sleep mode for maybe an hour. is this a power saving feature of windows 11 or an issue? also, i\\'ve never noticed any errors in reliability monitor. this never happened on my previous w10 laptop as in it always started from the lockscreen. what are some good settings changes i can make to this? i heard that tweaking the factory presets can be good for the laptop as the title suggests last night while watching youtube on my xps 9520 the touchpad felt stuck, all of a sudden it was really hard to press down. the bottom corners would press down but the middle felt like there was something directly under that wouldn\\'t allow for any movement. i hoped on dell support and they weren\\'t helpful, suggesting i update windows to resolve the issue (as if its a software bug). i\\'m planning to have the the laptop serviced once finals are over for this semester (still covered under warranty). this morning the track pad felt better, now it seems to be back to normal. what could the issue be? how could it have broke and gone back to normal without really anything happening to it? could this be a battery bloating problem? the laptop is relatively new, i got it in late june. the only other problems i\\'ve had are really poor battery life and two mushy keys on the keyboard. my xps 13 9305 that i bought back in june (2022) has blue screened twice in 3 days. the screen only stays up for a few seconds and then the machine restarts however it is not the kind of behaviour i would expect from an effectively brand new machine. as a fairly tech savvy person i\\'m quite comfortable with fixing the issue myself however some pointers on where i should start looking for a fix or even some pointers on what the problem could be would be much appreciated. i ordered an xps 13 from dell\\'s website during the black friday event, and payed the extra $32.99 to ensure i got the computer quickly (estimated from dec. 6-9) prior to our international trip on the 14th. however, i logged into the website today and saw that the order was delayed and wouldn\\'t ship until the 9th, and wouldn\\'t be delivered until the 14th, which obviously wouldn\\'t work. i tried calling today but it looks like the office for order support is closed until monday. does dell normally expedite shipping? it looks like it\\'s done with the production phase (i got the 9315, i7, non-touch screen in umber), but just needs to be shipped. i tried looking online and it seems like there has been a trend of orders being delayed without expedition of shipping. my other option is that i could order a laptop from another place and then cancel the order from dell or return it once it gets here, however if i could keep the one from dell (i liked that umber color), then i would. but i\\'d have to place that order today if i hope to get it in before my trip. the return policy seems to be more generous with the second place, and i might be within both windows once we return (jan 6), if i find that dell cannot cancel the order nor expedite shipping. i think the only problem would be that id have to arrange delivery/pickup in the event it arrives while we are gone. what\\'s the best course of action? should i just get both laptops and hope for the best case scenario? i need this laptop for travel so just looking for what to do here. thanks! i recently got dell xps 17 - 9720 and getting 4-5 hours of runtime on a single charge. i want to ensure that the dgpu is automatically switched off on battery to increase battery life. how to do that? also, how to manually force use intel integrated graphics for all applications? hi team! i have a dell xps 9520 with a spanish keyboard. is it possible to change the keyboard module to an english one? i\\'ve checked ebay, amazon, ali and dell\\'s own webstores, and only found one offer for a sus low price on ebay. is there maybe a simpler way? i need it only for short time. because this ssd was inside my old (broken) laptop. and some data is on this ssd. so i will need to put this ssd into my dell xps 17 which i will buy soon. and then i will just transfer this data to my another hard drive which i will connect to my dell if not, then idk what to do. my laptop is broken. can’t be repaired and there are some important files on this ssd debating replacing my 9 year old dell xps 15 (9530) with the dell xps 13 plus, but would like it to do some gaming. what spces would you recommend? i do some video editing, and 3d design. hi all! is this space between lid and body by design (see attachment)? i don\\'t have this on an older xps 15 9550, but i suspect it might be intentional, so want to check if anyone else has seen smth similar or knows if this is an issue or not. i can see smth similar on a pic from this review https://www.notebookcheck.net/dell-xps-15-9510-review-multimedia-laptop-convinces-with-new-oled-panel.554277.0.html , but maybe not as accentuated ? just wondering if this is \"normal\" or i should return it. thanks \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/3mfj0h7lxh3a1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35c70672ec027892b5db7624ace0dacf22e6c7fa https://preview.redd.it/vffl9j7lxh3a1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbc299f6aea38d99b3d52d9f38c67531bf8b22f8 anybody knows what parts should i buy if i want to upgrade myself ram and internal memory? i want 64gb ram and 8tb memory. i know parts for 15 inch model, are they the same for 17 inch? for ram its mushkin redline ddr4 64 gb(2x32gb) 3200mhz and then 2x4tb ssd. inland platinum 4tb ssd m.2 2280 nvme pcle gen 3.0 x 4 3d edit: model is 9720. 2022 year model. current one which they sell havent bought it yet though i have been looking to upgrade the storage on my dell xps 13 9310 (non touch) it has only 256 gb of ssd and i wanted to know what kinda ssd should i be looking for and if there is any compatibility issues i was thinking of buying samsung - 980 1tb internal gaming ssd pcie gen 3 x4 nvme and am not sure if it will work on my laptop please recommend me a good fast ssd if possible also would this ssd work ? samsung - 980 pro 1tb internal gaming ssd pcie gen 4 x4 nvme sorry my english sucks (not my first language) hi all, i wanted to share this after figuring it out. i was having very poor battery life while the machine (12700h, 3060, 16gb ram, 512gb nvme, fhd display) was basically just sitting idle or doing extremely light tasks like browsing reddit. did a battery rundown test last night and from 100% charge, screen all they way dim, keyboard backlight on dim, streaming 4k youtube, bt enabled and after 4hr 45mins i stopped the test and had just 21% remaining with an estimated 1hr 10mins left. this machine was bought specifically (with lower res screen) for the best possible battery life, so i was really unhappy with this result. i\\'d already removed all of the dell bloatware and a lot of the bundled microsoft stuff too, so it\\'s a fairly \\'clean\\' os, but not a fresh install. downloaded hwinfo and discovered that even at idle, thing was drawing 30w, which i know from reading here is about triple what it\\'s supposed to be. realized that there\\'s an nvidia tool that runs in the taskbar that showed 2 applications that were using the gpu... logonui.exe and searchhost.exe. apparently searchhost is related to cortana. i did find a powershell script that was posted that supposedly removes it. the other suggestion that helped was to go into 3d settings in the nvidia control panel and manually \"prefer\" the intel gpu by default and then manually set any games to specifically use the nvidia gpu. this brought the idle wattage in hwinfo down to 8-10w and the battery life estimates shot way up to where they should be, though they have fluctuated around a lot (i think windows is really confused about how to predict that right now). i will try to repeat the rundown test and/or keep an eye on it to see if this change is permanent or if anything else happens. i have the same machine. sorry but i don\\'t hear any buzzing on your video. it sounds the same as my machine. is this normal for the xps 13 plus screen? there\\'s essentially a dark streak across the screen https://imgur.com/a/g1tptet contact dell support for full system replacement. you have 1 year & 9520 model just released this year. hello, i have a new xps 15 9520 with 16gb of ram. i tried to install this ram kit upgrade from crucial, which is two 32gb sticks of ddr5 ram 4800mhz. i shut down the computer, took off the back, unplugged the battery and swapped in the new ram. but after i closed it back up and tried to turn it on it got as far as the black screen with the white dell logo and no further. the light in front did not blink to indicate a ram failure, or anything else. i put my old ram back in and it starts up as normal. any advice on where to go from here? i see plenty on ebay. black and white ones - backlit also available. is this normal for the xps 13 plus screen? there\\'s essentially a dark streak across the screen https://imgur.com/a/g1tptet my xps 17 9710 w/ rtx 3060 gpu constantly has this issue when using hdmi output via usb-c adapter. driver has been updated. what is the culprit & how to fix? hi all, just wondering how everyone’s batteries are doing, in terms of degradation. i’ve had my 9520/i7/32gb/2.5tb/oled since august 2022, and according to hwinfo, my battery has degraded by 10.7%. i am very, very careful about using it on well ventilated surfaces, never using it on a bed or blanket, and i also do not leave it charging overnight. basically, i follow best practices to elongate battery life (same practices with my iphone x, still has 97% capacity remaining, for example). tia! mine has been doing it for 2 years now. i currently have an xps 13 from 2017, which i\\'m super happy with. but it\\'s starting to get due for an upgrade. should i wait for the 2023 version or buy the top model now? anyone know wtf just happened with the latest intel driver update (31.0.101.3616)? i started getting this error on just 1 game (thankfully) as of ~2 weeks ago when windows updated. looks like something got botched as far as vulkan support goes (game starts and runs for a couple mins and then crashes with this error). anyone know a workaround around this dreaded vk_error_device_lost? (can\\'t update anything else as everything is up to date.) i just got my 8950 and realized that the 1 tb internal ssd that comes with it is not enough. i\\'d like to get a 2tb internal ssd to add to it, but i want to ensure i get the right one, with good read/write speeds. i think these are the specs that have to be followed: m.2 2280 solid-state drive, pcie gen4.0x4 nvme, up to 64 gbps any recommendations? especially price-wise considering i just missed black fri/cyber mon? thanks! i\\'m at my wits end with trying to get a decent headset setup with my xps 9520. all drivers updated to latest from dell website. the main issues are: if i connect a bluetooth headset, initial connection can be hit or miss if i connect a bluetooth headset and then disconnect, re-connecting is guaranteed to be a nightmare. the device will connect, but not be made the audio output device the device will connect, become the audio output device then not output audio if i connect an aux headset, sometimes i have to plug the damn thing in twice if i connect then reconnect an aux headset, again, issues i have tried using many devices from samsung, jabra, sony, anker, all of which work perfectly adequately on other devices. has anyone else experienced these issues and found a solution? work laptop, so unfortunately can\\'t do full reinstall. interestingly, the release notes mention a fix for getting stuck at 0%. i applied the update, and behold, stuck at 0% while saving manifest i was able to force power off by holding power button for 35 seconds and releasing, and it went into some sort of bios recovery mode here is the same issue on a different model dell, last month. https://www.dell.com/community/latitude/latitude-3420-stuck-on-firmware-update/td-p/8285678 i just bought a refurbished (like new condition) xps 9315 i7/16gb/1tb from dell outlet and so far its been working great except for one issue: the screen constantly keeps \"blinking\" or even \"flickering\". it doesn\\'t flicker to black, but more like it keeps going to a higher screen brightness and then reverts back to what it was within a split second. it happens when its idle, and when i\\'m using it for any purpose. while i\\'m typing this out, it must have flashed at least 30 times, with varying frequency. it\\'s less noticeable when the laptop is on max brightness, but noticeable nonetheless. is there a solution to this at all? they were going consistently, for example the 9500, 9510, and 9520, but they can\\'t use 9530 for 2023 because that\\'s already been used back in 2013. i\\'m curious what they will do. i am curious to know how long you have had your laptop and how it’s holding up? would you recommend it to others? thanks to and inspired by /u/sparkko\\'s thread from last year seen while googling this problem where they added thermal pads to the same model laptop\\'s heat piping to help dissipate more heat via the laptop\\'s aluminum casing. thanks for sharing your solution as i did the same thing and its essentially cured the laptop (though i left the nvme alone as i have no heat trouble with mine during max speed raw r/w) i run linux on mine and realized the fans kick in a little too often for short bursts of load or when a huge single threaded load gets scheduled onto just the right core. the cpu throttles itself to 2.7ghz or lower when all threads are doing enough work. i know the i7-1195g7 inside is capable of 4.7ghz on all 8 threads of the 4 cores for at least a good 10 seconds or longer if cooled well. let alone a single thread which would do 4.7ghz for significantly longer alone. i used this command combo to quickly check how each core\\'s thread pairs respond to heat: timeout 15 taskset -c x,x stress --cpu 2 which generates 100% load for two threads picked by the taskset command before it... for 15 seconds. i got these results: core1(0,4), rose from idle 42c to 83c by 15s, ok core2(1,5), rose from idle 57c to 93c by 15s, not great, with load on other cores can easily induce thermal throttling core3(2,6), rose from idle 42c to 83c quickly but no higher by 15s, ok core4(3,7), rose from idle 46c to 100c within the first second of the test. thermal throttled the host all on its own and near instantly. i purchased some \"grizzly kryonaut\" thermal paste and \"minus pad 8\\'s\" of the same brand to help this laptop with and eventually got into a position where i could shut it down and open everything up. i disconnected the battery and fan power terminals then unscrewed the heat pipe fan system and lifted it off. the stock thermal paste was an absolute shock. like somebody or some manufacturing machine just squeezed it all out and sandwiched the heat pipe on top. looking carefully at both the heatsink and cpu, it\\'s evident the bottom right corner of my cpu die had nearly no paste at all (likely the 4th core\\'s area...). very uneven spread and excessive paste in all the wrong spots. i cleaned that all up and applied a dot of this kryonaut paste to both heat spreaders of the cpu and evened it out with the included spatula (i assume the smaller die is the iris xe graphics / igpu?) before sandwiching the cpu with the heat pipes once more. i then cut up one of the minus pads into four long strips and one wide strip for the center of the heat pipe cooling package where the paste is. the laptop is now idling at an impressive varying 22-30c on the four cores. stress testing each of the cpu core thread pairs again over 15 seconds per pair i saw much better numbers and the laptop was happy to keep them all at 4.7ghz for a long time. stressing all 8 cpu threads however does eventually clock down to 2.7ghz which is fair for stressing an all core boost. new final temps after modification: core1(0,4), rose from idle 22c to 62c, held 4.7ghz clock for entire duration. core2(1,5), rose from idle 26c to 78c, held 4.7ghz clock for entire duration. core3(2,6), rose from idle 23c to 60c held 4.7ghz clock for entire duration. core4(3,7), rose from idle 28c to 61c held 4.7ghz clock for entire duration. luckily as an soe i run telegraf on all my machines which sends various host metrics to my influxdb server at home. i use grafana to chart data such as the cpu core temperatures and it\\'s a very obvious overall improvement looking at the laptop\\'s four core temperatures over the last few days compared to today, post mod. especially post load temperature recovery. tl;dr, temperature issues on your dell xps? if it\\'s out of warranty definitely spend the $30 on some new grease and pads to cut up and put on the heat pipes to further assist in thermals. there are so many pictures online of the xps range with extremely bad stock paste in threads just like i linked at the top. figured it\\'d be worth spreading more information on just how well this mod can improve temps, discourage cpu throttling and also prevent fans spinning up for nothing over day to day use. i use a brand new dell xps 15 9520 with manjaro gnome. the battery life is round about 6 hours. i also have tlp installed and enabled. but i would expect more than 6 hours. have somebody the same troubles? looking at getting the xps 13 (9315) i7-1250u, iris xe graphics, 16 gb ram. would anyone know if this would suffice for some basic 4k video editing (davinci resolve)? i\\'m not very knowledgeable with this stuff having a hard time figuring out if these specs will suffice based on the posted davinci system requirements. not getting any hits from other subreddits so any help would be much appreciated! i know that the premium active pen works on the 2 in 1 version, but i cant find anything about the laptop. i use ubuntu 20.04 and the touch screen works great. the xps 9720 supports the ddr4800. as faster ddr5 sodimm becomes available, will the dell be able to support this? my xps 13 plus (9320)\\'s touchpad has recently started playing up. i noticed earlier that the click sounded sharper, and occassionally lagged behind the click action. now its started clicking repeatedly after i click until i mash the touchpad a few times. behaviour is unchanged after reboots, full shutdowns etc.. there are no drivers or formal ware showing in dell update. not really sure what\\'s changed. i did install the 1.9.0 bios earlier so that\\'s a possibility. i just got a new dell xps 9520. a lot of people say that it is recommended to do a clean install of windows 11 to remove all the bloatware, but how big of a difference will this make? how much drive space does it save? are there any noticeable imporvements in performane? does battery life increase? can i just uninstall the useless programs by hand? https://youtu.be/ylzb2mm1x-a my laptop got bricked or whatever the term is, two months in. it began with the laptop performing like a decade old hdd laptop running at 10 frames a second and after factory reset, cant even start it up anymore, all it gives is a memory/ram error and to contact the customer care. and guess what, i5+touchscreen is not even a combination you can purchase anymore on the website. selecting that screen upgrades your processor to i7 automatically. sales rep said i5+touchscreen is only viable on the 2 in 1s. its not compatible in 9315. the tech support says there is no such incompatibility in the manual. i am sending the laptop back to the company just two months in and no one has answers. i told them to give me a refund instead of sending it back. not gonna brute force use a laptop config thats not even on the market. what a mess. https://youtu.be/ylzb2mm1x-a hi experts, i would like to know if anyone knows how to solve this problem with my keyboard. i have a dell 9310 2-in-1 laptop, and have had it for about a year and a half. the problem started to happen about half a year ago and i cannot find a permanent solution to fix it. basically, the keyboard would randomly stops responding completely, sometimes you can have no problem for a few days straight, but sometimes it can reappear as soon as in a few mins. because my laptop is a 2-in-1 so it can be flipped over, the keyboard would come back to life after i flipped my screen over and flipped back. and no, it\\'s not a tablet mode false triggering issue as i have looked into this before and it was not a tablet mode cause. if i do not fix it by flipping my screen back and forth, another way to temporary bring it back to life is to simply turn off my laptop for a while and start it (or remove the battery would definitely do so). simply by restarting the laptop while the issue is appearing, would not fix it. sometimes when i was browsing around in the bios setup page entered by pressing f12 or f2, after i restarted it from those pages, the keyboard usually would be fixed too, sometimes it would not. i have tried nearly everything on my side trying to fix it. that being said, i have tried things i can find online such as dell\\'s bios update, keyboard driver reinstallation via device manager, sticky keys / toggle keys off, etc., and i have tried multiple clean reinstallations of windows 10 and 11 (everything gets erased in case there is some applications or corrupted files that are causing the issue). an external keyboard would work, and in the bios setup page, my laptop\\'s keyboard also would work too even while the issue just appeared from a normal use. after a lot of research and experience, i do not think it is a hardware issue, but anyway i ordered and replaced the keyboard thinking that it might have been that the keyboard\\'s connectors or something were broken. however, the problem persists!!! now, my conclusion is that it is likely either gonna be a motherboard issue, or more likely to be some corrupted files/setups in the bios system. the reason i suspect that it is likely to be the bios problm, is because i have been keeping my bios version up to date from every new release by dell since i first purchased my laptop. there was no problem for the first 7 months, until one day it started to appear frequently. during that peaceful 7-month period, i had probably had 3 updates for the bios from each release. therefore, i suspect that maybe the newer bios versions after my original one has all contained some bugs that have been affecting my keyboard. dell\\'s technicians have been always advising me to update bios to solve this issue, but mine is already up to date. since an update would fix the issue, i wanted to downgrade my bios to last year\\'s version before the problem started to appear. but i still have not figured out a way to downgrade it as the normal exe application download and automatic flash process would not succeed as some progress was blocked from proceeding further. any method to downgrade it? i have heard that a forceful downgrade would be risky as it can make the bios a useless brick though, which is concerning. so my questions are: 1. is a clean install of the windows system completely clean (like can files/bugs/apps still manage to escape from the reset?) 2. is it likely the bios problem? 3. what do you think it\\'s likely the causes of it? 4. what are your suggestions to diagnose them and get the problem resolved? thanks!!! if you have more questions about some details of the issue, i am happy to share them for you to help further investigate. before i start i need to come clean. i\\'ve been apple user for years. don\\'t get me wrong, i wasn\\'t mindless drone praising apple 24/7. i used apple devices because i considered them as the best for my needs. however in past year or two apple made it clear that i\\'m not the \"pro\" user. but this is the completely different story i will tell the other day. let\\'s focus on the new dell xps 13 laptop. when i was escaping the apple garden, i\\'ve tested bazillion laptops. the one that passed the most of my tests was dell xps 17. despite few shortcomings i still think it was the best choice for me. once i\\'ve replaced my main laptop i\\'ve started to look for a replacement for my ipad pro (m1 version). literally, days after i\\'ve decided to look for a new tablet, new dell 2-in-1 laptop was released. the price was similar to the equivalent ipad pro (including accessories - keyboard and stylus) but instead of a glorified iphone i would be using a real laptop in a form of a tablet. after checking multiple reviews i got myself a brand new shiny dell 2-in-1 laptop/tablet. and this is where the things went sideways. but before i start bashing dell i need to state that i\\'m using fedora linux. the only moment i lunched windows was to download new version of fedora and to save it on a good old pendrive. while theoretically latest fedora (and gnome) seems to be ok with touchscreens it takes more than a brave person to say that new dell xps 13 laptop is linux friendly. let me list all of the issues: - fingerprint scanner doesn\\'t work - despite it\\'s working fine on a new xps 17 laptop- there\\'s no sound - \"dummy output\" is the only thing i can get (no matter the \"fix i try\")- forget about suspending your \"laptop\", it will die overnight. it will drain the battery 5-10% per hour. unfortunately hibernation sucks on fedora (at least it sucks for me).- stylus just \"works\". it\\'s more than subpar than apple pencil.- folio is just horrible. there\\'s no way to use it on your laps which sucks due to \"laptop\" branding. i haven\\'t used it but i\\'m pretty sure microsoft surface would be much better choice.- default folio is just crap. the magnet is so weak that every single time i try to touch the screen when the keyboard is attached, the magnets loose the grip and the whole device just drops on the table. to summarize. if you want to buy a device that won\\'t work as you would like, get it. otherwise wait for the drivers or buy something else. i was thanking of getting dell xps 15 (9520) especially because it\\'s on black friday sale right now. but most of the time i come across a thread about it it\\'s mostly negative. are there any better alternatives. majority of my workload would be programming, watching movies and some light gaming. i recently purchased a brand new xps 9520 from dell. i use it for photo editing work only, and so far, it\\'s been incredibly unreliable out of the box. issues: • random blue screens of death • overheating when not in use when the blue screen of death happens, the laptop is cool, and i am only running lightroom & photoshop. i wasn\\'t able to take note of the full error code before reboot, but i believe it was \"something - graphics - error.\" the bsod doesn\\'t seem to be related to the overheating as far as i can tell. i think i may have fixed the overheating issue for now. i adjusted the laptop\\'s sleep settings, and so far setting it to \\'hibernate\\' when i\\'m not using it seems to be preventing the random overheating for now. the bsod is still happening randomly. i store all files on external drives and keep the laptop clean and free of things that could hinder performance. i only use the laptop to run the editing programs i need to for my job. anyone else noticed bsod issues with a new 9520 xps? for a brand new $3.2k laptop, i really had much higher performance expectations. so far it\\'s only been an expensive headache that has hindered my work flow. hi everyone, i\\'ve a dell xps 13 9310 and i\\'ve started experiencing this message on boot \\'hard drive - not installed\\', i\\'ve replaced my nvme for one that i know it works and it does the same. i\\'ve done the following: update the bios with a flash drive to the latest bios 3.11.0 played around with sata/nvme operations (disabled/ahci-nvme/raid) restore the bios defaults after updating the bios to latest the computer booted up to the os in the drive but after shutting the machine off and turning it back off i ended up on the same message of the machine not recognising the drive, any ideas?

what can i do to fix it? because there’s next to no info on compatible ram, i wanted to share. i am trying to buy the xps 13 2 in 1 (as seen in the image below) due to its small size and portability the only problem is when i search for xps 13 2 in 1 on dell it only shows up with the detachable keyboard version. else it shows xps 13 plus laptop or just xps 13 laptop. what is the laptop in the picture actually called? https://preview.redd.it/8vl2xwqkm52a1.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=18722ec50e9184777a82583d697ae34a60973fe8 i have been using my xps 13 for a week now. lets just say i was scared after reading the reviews but decided to purchase it anyway since it is one of the few laptops that fits my thin and light criteria with linux out of the box. looking at the specs i thought to myself... if this works better than people are saying then its my dream laptop. my config: i5 1230u, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd, ubuntu 20.04. i started using this laptop expecting to regret my purchase. however, this thing is great. fast as can be, screen is bright and vibrant (non touch fhd), battery lasts all day in normal and development loads, camera looks good, and dell\\'s custom ubuntu image provides a lot of stability as compared to installing a distro yourself. the keyboard sounds and feels sooooo good. i am switching from a thinkpad t14 so i will admit i am not coming from the most luxurious machine. however, looking at this device for what it is and what it is supposed to be, it ticks every box it should in its arena. i just wanted to come on here and say, if you are hesitant on buying the 9315 due to the negativity. don\\'t listen to the bad reviews especially if you feel like this is your perfect machine. i will take some specific benchmarks or questions if people have them but in all honesty i love this little laptop. just ordered a new pc online. xps 8950 i7-12700 with regular fan cooling, rtx 3060ti and 460w chassis. https://deals.dell.com/en-ca/productdetail/fra2 i keep reading that there are problems with overheating. are there recommendations as to how to best resolve this issue ? will buying a better cpu fan resolve it ? would a i5-12400f have less heating problems ? hey all, my ‘b’ key works intermittently on my xps 13 9310; i’ve got to press it real hard to register. any idea how to fix? thanks! scored a xps 13 plus for a killer of a deal. i have never been a windows fan, so i am curious to know what sort of linux distros work well on this machine. since it is ubuntu certified, i had tried the live usb of ubuntu and for the most part a lot of the features work, but i am unsure how the battery life will look long term as well as features such as windows hello / ubuntus howdy. anyone have some idea? so i\\'ve been using this laptop for about a month now, and i absolutely love the 4k screen, except for the color management. i\\'ve learned to live with it a bit - for example, i have learned to keep the screen around 75% brightness, which seems to be the right level. but the color gamut, and saturation, is tricky - especially because i create art and having a screen that is somewhat accurate is important. i have been going into the premiercolor application and switching back and forth between the vibrant(full) or photo(adobe rgb) settings, depending on whether i want to be dazzled with color or if i want to see something a little more realistic. what i think i would like to have is some setting in between these two options, but i have no idea how to go about making that happen. the adobe rgb setting seems just a little too unsaturated for my eyes. maybe the right answer is to properly calibrate the display, but i\\'d really like to avoid spending the money on a calibration device for now. is there a quick and dirty way to adjust saturation or gamut? i’m looking to get a new laptop and i found a 9510 on the dell outlet with i7-11th, 32 gb ram, 1 tb ssd, 3.5k, and the 3050 ti for $1470 in like new condition. for black friday rakuten has 12% cash back on the outlet so it comes out to about $1295 which seems like an insanely good price. there’s also one in like new condition with 16 gb ram, and 512 ssd for $1310 which with the cash back would be about $1150. i’ve never bought refurb before so i’m somewhat skeptical. so what are your guys thoughts on buying from the outlet and is this a good deal? hi, do i have to install windows again after installing 2nd ssd in slot 2 leaving slot 1 or the bootable ssd untouched? (dell xps 15 9520) does anyone have the xps 9720 i5 12500h 16gb version? i\\'m thinking it should have very good thermals because of the cpu core design and the vapor chamber cooling. for that reason i don\\'t really want a 12700h version, while it\\'s theoretically faster, practically scores the same as the 12500h version because of the thermals. i need a laptop that stay silent under medium cpu/gpu load. most of my work is done windows, so i\\'m desperately searching for a thin and elegant windows laptop that has the best thermal capabilities. or i\\'ll stick to a macbook pro 14 or 16 and emulate windows through parallels i really like my new xps, but i wish i had’nt ordered it so hastily before researching other options, especially the new m-chip series macs. the only reason i’m considering returning the xps is cause of the poor battery life. would it be worth it to return it and get a macbook air instead, or should i just keep it and get a power bank? i have the xps13 9315 (2022) & s2721dgf monitor. ever since i connected my laptop to the monitor my laptop works as if its got a decade-old hdd in it. whatever i type, or changing windows or any daily activity, it all works with a couple of seconds of delay. its frustrating. any tips greatly appreciated. https://imgur.com/pp5t1oq 9520 new from september. windows suddenly started acting strange, keystrokes would not register, mouse click did nothing and then the machine blacked out. is this normal behaviour? dell\\'s bios and the dell app show battery health as excellent. my xps 17 9710 has two weird sleep behaviors that aren\\'t necessarily related, but occur at the same time, and i\\'ve never had this issue with any other computer, laptop or otherwise, before. first - i have my windows sleep settings configured such that the device never sleeps when charging, because it\\'s almost exclusively charging when docked to this usb-c dongle i have (to be clear - it\\'s not charging through the usb-c dongle, the laptop charger and dongle both live at my desk and are connected at the same time). but, this setting only seems to be respected if i leave the device unlocked - if i lock it to step away, when i come back it will have gone to sleep second - when it\\'s asleep, i always have to try to wake it twice, and in a very specific way when i touch the keyboard, or even if i push the power button on the laptop itself, the control wheel on my corsair k100 will light up, but the laptop won\\'t wake. if i don\\'t touch it again, nothing happens, and if i wait until the light turns off, the next time i touch the keyboard or laptop it\\'s as if nothing happened. however, if i touch the keyboard or power button once, and then touch it again, while the light is on, then it will wake the way i expect it to. it\\'s almost like the first touch wakes the usb ports, and the second touch actually wakes the device, except that it also behaves this way for the power button which has nothing to do with the dock at all. so it feels like there is something stuck under my touchpad.. its pretty low in the bottom left corner and it doesnt click properly at all, cant right click.. does anyone have a quick (ish) fix for this or do i need to start dissembling shit? i\\'m planning to buy the new 9520 base configuration with hd screen and 56wh battery without a dedicated graphics, what to expect? i have also xps now with i5-8750h cpu and 56wh battery without dedicated gpu. is the 12700h upgrade in efficiency, or expect lower battery life? looking for some help, i purchased a xps 8950 that should be here sometime this week. it\\'s my first new cpu purchase in over 10 years. since i was looking originally at a alienware r13 i spent alot of time on the alienware reddit and saw that i should do a fresh install of windows from usb first thing. is that still applicable? anything else i should do/look out for? could anyone help me out with what i should do before it starts getting used or perhaps point me in the direction where it has the information online that i can follow the steps..... any help would be greatly appreciated! it is configured as.... xps desktop 8950 210-bccd 1 mcafee live safe xps 12 month subscription 525-0036 1 onsite/in-home service after remote diagnosis, 1 year 801-1849 1 512gb nvme m.2 pcie ssd (boot) + 2tb 7200rpm sata 6gb/s (storage) 400-bmnw 1 dell.com order 332-1530 2 12th gen intel(r)core(tm) i7-12700 processor (12-core, 25mb cache, 2.1ghz to 4.9ghz) 338-cfom 1 nvidia(r) geforce rtx(tm) 3060 ti 8gb (lhr) 490-bgyv 1 750w night sky bezel chassis including optical drive 321-bhgx 1 us power cord 450-aago 1 windows system driver 631-adem 1 windows 11 home, english 619-aptk 1 performance cpu liquid cooling 321-bhgn 1 16gb ddr5, 2x 8gb, at 4400mhz; up to 128gb (additional memory sold separately) 370-agsz 1 tray load dvd drive (reads and writes to dvd/cd) 429-aaxx 1 killer(tm) wi-fi 6 1675 (2x2) 802.11ax wireless and bluetooth 5.2 555-bgst 1 dell multimedia keyboard-kb216 black (english) 580-aili 1 dell wired mouse blk 570-aath 1 custom configuration 817-bbbb 1 killer(tm) wi-fi 6 1675 (2x2) 802.11ax wireless and bluetooth 5.1 driver i have the xps13 9315 (2022) & s2721dgf monitor. ever since i connected my laptop to the monitor my laptop works as if its got a decade-old hdd in it. whatever i type, or changing windows or any daily activity, it all works with a couple of seconds of delay. its frustrating. any tips greatly appreciated. where i am, the xps 15 (12700h, 3050-ti) is on a $370 discount ($1650) and the inspiron (12700h, 3060) on a $260 discount ($1380). pros of inspiron: $270 cheaper, better gpu (3060 60w vs 3050-ti 40w), better ports (usb and hdmi) pros of xps: form factor (which is important to me, i travel and move around a lot) - lighter, smaller, thinner, thinner bezels. also has option for fhd (better for games and battery life), i don\\'t need 3k i also have a $150 gift card, so on top of the discount both are pretty good deals. i\\'m really split between them. any and all help is much appreciated. i have a dell xps 13 and i hate it simply because it gets smudged easily. after using it for a couple of hours, the whole keyboard is covered in fingerprints. the palm rest too. i\\'ve resulted to using an external keyboard and mouse to avoid cleaning the laptop repeatedly, and so moving the laptop around is something i avoid. thing is, i never had this issue with my last hp or with my current thinkpad i got from my employer, and this has put me off dell. however, i saw the xps 13 plus and it is a thing of beauty. i\\'m thinking of getting it, but i want to know if it\\'s the same as the xps 13 when it comes to smudges. hello, on my xps 15 9510 running w11 i have this weird issue. when i am done with my work, i turn off my laptop, clicking on the windows icon, then the io symbol on the bottom right of the menu, then turn off. every single laptop in the world would behave by turning the system off, while my xps 15 sometimes turns off properly, some other times hangs in some kind of limbo, where the system is shut down, the screen is turned off, but the machine just goes in an ethernal overheating with vents at max speed. in order to shut it down completely i have to press on the physical power button for some seconds, that usually happens around 30 minutes of overheating, which creates some problems when turning the laptop on again (windows recovery messages due to turn off in a forced way). is there a way to prevent this from happening? all my options are set to hybernate when closing the lid or pressing the power button, however this is about the normal way to turn off my laptop from windows. windows update is up to date, dell update is up to date. looking for some help, i purchased a xps 8950 that should be here sometime this week. it\\'s my first new cpu purchase in over 10 years. since i was looking originally at a alienware r13 i spent alot of time on the alienware reddit and saw that i should do a fresh install of windows from usb first thing. is that still applicable?

it\\'s driving me crazy. hi all, i currently have my dell xps 13 connected to a 32\" 4k benq monitor via dp. i am looking to upgrade to a 42\" lg c2, however it only has hdmi. i remember when i first connected the dell to the 32\" 4k screen (via a dell d6000 dock) via hdmi it had flickering issues, which is why i started using dp. will i run in to the same issues with the lg c2 given it only has hdmi? i have had this laptop for 2 weeks now, i love it. but i’m noticing when i go out to other areas besides my house the wifi is really unstable and slow. what can i do? please and thank you i had this problem with one of my systems. according to microsoft the 22h2 rollout is phased, so it may be that your system is in a later phase. what is more likely is that the system is being considered as \\'incompatible\\' because of one of several known issues. in my case, it was blocking on a print driver which was known to cause issues with 22h2. i removed the driver and was able to upgrade; otherwise, i wouldn\\'t be offered the update until the issue was fixed on microsoft\\'s end. i posted this already on the r/dell sub, decided to bring it here as its an xps laptop. i\\'m on a xps 9510, running windows 11. now, on windows 10, you could set \"better performance\" when plugged, or \"best performance\"....then \"better battery\" or \"best battery\" when not charging. i want to know of theres something similar to that on windows 11, without the conventional \"power saving, balanced, and performance\" in battery settings. before describing the issues, i have already gone through tech support and reinstalled all the av/mic drivers, run diagnostics, etc. has not fixed the problem, so any suggestions would be appreciated. basically about 70% of the time i try to stream video on youtube or some other site, either it won\\'t play altogether, or it will start playing until i try to adjust the volume within the flash player, and then it will crash. this happens on multiple sites/players. if i open services.msc and restart the \"windows audio\" (driver?), then the video will start again and usually work fine for a while. the second problem, is when i try to do voice or video calls on whatsapp, zoom, or microsoft teams. sometimes i can hear but can\\'t speak, other times both won\\'t work. it will come up with a little message on screen saying your microphone and/or speaker is in use by another application. i\\'m wondering if it\\'s connected to the first issue, because restarting windows audio in services also fixes this problem temporarily. i have had these problems basically since the first week of having the computer. i did uninstall some bloatware like xbox games and stuff, but otherwise have not made any modifications to the os. any help would be greatly appreciated. it takes around 2h10mins to charge my xps 13 9310 (w/ 50,973mwh battery capacity) from below 10% to 100% using the 45w charger. is this normal? i just bought an xps 9520 with the fhd and have been feeling the side effects of pwm sensitivity (severe eye-strain, headache, & slight nausea). has anyone else felt the same? if so, can someone suggest a solution to this? i really like my 9520 & would like to keep it instead of returning. i was originally under the impression that this was not an issue with the fhd display as it is an ips screen as opposed to an oled & i read it was recommended for those who are sensitive to pwm. for background, my work computer (dell precision 7530) gives me no such issues, but i do have get slight headaches from using my google pixel 6. i had this same exact problem on my old 2011 l702x because i attempted to run roblox on it for fun. i wouldn\\'t advise this but i sumo wrestler style slammed the laptop over the gpu and it worked. so something to do with your gpu for sure... or cpu. depending on which is rendering since they have an igpu that runs in parallel with the gpu. hi, i was wondering if anyone had anything similar to what i am experiencing. it feels very much like a hardware problem, rather than software, but maybe i am wrong. sometimes unwanted extra clicking is activated. and not just an accidental click, but rather multiple glitchy clicks. in attached video at 4-5s it clicks 2nd time without me pressing, but sometimes it clicks 1-3 extra clicks. and another issue is that sometimes after clicking it lags to unclick like in attached video at around 9-10. because of that it clicks, selects text and drags it around. or grabs a tab and pulls it out of a browser. bought this device for work and reinstalling with different oses or sending it back for warranty is quite difficult as i would not have a laptop to work with, so thought i will ask if anyone saw something similar https://reddit.com/link/z0ha7x/video/r8oan339j61a1/player hello. could any owners of a dell xps 15 9520 with the fhd+ non-touch screen send me/link me to a picture of the screen. i’d like to see what the non glass finish looks like and if the pixels are noticeable. thanks hi! just had a couple of questions: if i\\'m able to get an i9 9720 for essentially the same price as an i7, is it worth it? this is the info i have: i9 wont be any faster than the i7 (not imp if they cost the same) the i9 creates more heat and reduces battery life (read this about the 9520, but not sure if it applies to the 9720 considering the larger case and vapor cooling) furthermore, how much better is the 3060 than the 3050? which one would you recommend for someone using photoshop and streaming to make a long story short, i attempted to clean install win11 on my new xps 9520 to get rid of all pre-intalled \"malicious software\" that slows my system. however, i found it was extremely difficult to perform a clean install this time probably because dell is using new wifi-card/bios (or whatever), and during the process i\\'ve encountered 1. win11 could not recognize my storage drives 2. after the installation the system could not find any networks. so eventually after several hours i figured it out and thought it might be a good idea to share the solution. https://preview.redd.it/n1yza6a1az0a1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5982e967bb37fe4e7fbe5d8abcf349677f0693c xps17 <-> supplied usb-c to hdmi/usb3 adaptor <-> hdmi cable <-> monitor either(1) cant detect external monitor and require a few plug/unplug(2) external monitor flickers and display does not scale properly edge to edge this problem is only present on the usb-c port on the right, just beside sd card slot. the rest of the other 3 usb-c ports work fine. all 4 ports work fine on power delivery (can charge laptop) this problem only surfaced yesterday. edit: screen aligns: https://imgur.com/a/cq95v7w screen does not align: https://imgur.com/a/imnn5m2 has anyone had the same experience i have on xps laptops? yesterday i had a few nvidia updates, after which my gpu stopped activating nonsensically when windows woke up from hibernation! i\\'ve been enjoying the laptop without this problem since yesterday. so the battery lasts longer (even if i use it very often connected to the mains) and the laptop is cooler. i have an xps 9720: nvidia geforce rtx 3060 laptop graphics card, 4k screen, i9. the new nvidia studio version is 526.98. thank you. so, i have an lg gram +view ips portable monitor (model 16mq70) that i can connect to my xps 15 and my macbook pro 14 via usb-c/thunderbolt 4 ports without a problem. on my xps 13 plus, however, the display powers up (it gets juice from the port) but the laptop doesn\\'t recognize it. that\\'s by default. if i go into the bios and turn off thunderbolt 4 support, then the display works fine. same if i keep thunderbolt 4 turned on but check the box to limit usb-c ports to power and display only (which presumably also turns off thunderbolt 4). just wondering if anyone else has seen this issue. got the dell xps 13 (9315) today and immediately refunded it. i kinda bought it on impulse and got buyer\\'s remorse as soon as i saw better options, like the samsung galaxy book2 which i already purchased. my biggest complaint is the audio. right out of the box, it buzzed like crazy even at 40% volume and at max volume, just sounds terrible. the chassis also vibrates so much. boot up was also really slow and the lack of ports and mid display and webcam are such a slap in the face lol. never buying an xps again. has anyone had the same experience i have on xps laptops?

i read somewhere the plus has more powerful components so wonder if that will also lead to higher electricity usage? does plus using 60w adapter versus 45w with regular model make a difference here however i was thinking more about more powerfull internal components in the plus using more electricity or how does that compare? i\\'m using it personally on dell xps 15 9520 oled version. after pretty rough first steps (i had to reinstall twice due to problems with nvidia and temperature handling) it is finally here for several weeks now. no problems whatsoever, everything works exactly as intended, including fingerprint scanner and screen auto-brightness. i can honestly recommend that distro. https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-ie/xps-13-9305-laptop/xps-9305-service-manual/major-components-of-xps-13-9305?guid=guid-8d7e3935-c495-4f1c-918b-087cc0607866&lang=en-us check the service manual. i\\'m afraid it\\'s soldered to the board. i have a ticket open with dell for this already, but in the meantime want to see if anyone else can corroborate this issue. have ubuntu 22.04 (hwe kernel 5.15.0-52-lowlatency) on this machine, and i\\'m having weird behaviour with the charger. if i boot the machine with the charger plugged in, it will subsequently never detect when it is unplugged (still shows as plugged in, but battery discharging), which means power saving policy based on the state of the charger never activates (ie, sleep when shutting the lid). (the machine still charges / discharges correctly and the front led shows the correct charging state so it appears to be a firmware/software fault and not a hardware one, at least as far as i can tell) if i boot the machine with the charger unplugged, everything behaves perfectly normally after plugging back in. have tested and confirmed this behaviour is consistent using a bunch of different usb-pd power sources across a range of manufacturers, both mains and battery power sources, and monitors with usb-c/usb-pd: dell 45w charger that came with the laptop (model \"036hfh\") dell 65w charger (model \"01n3py\") apple 90w charger anker 543 ii 45w charger ecoflow delta portable power station (100w capable) dell u3219q monitor (90w capable) lenovo p27h-20 monitor (90w capable) it seems to have persisted through a bunch of bios revisions too - currently running the latest 3.11.0, but remember this being an issue several versions ago (at least since 3.9.0, probably earlier) but i hadn\\'t conclusively identified the trigger at that point. hoping to avoid downgrading through versions until i find the one that isn\\'t affected (that is assuming that downgrading the bios even would downgrade the usb-pd firmware, which i doubt). any takers? most of the posts on this sub include issues on the xps\\'s but here\\'s a praise post! i have the oled touch 9520 i7 3050ti 32gb ram and i\\'m satisfied overall with the device. battery life is good, but not exceptional, i never let the device sleep and use hibernate as lid close action, and it really helps with extending the battery. it does wear out the ssd more (since i have 32gb ram to be written to and from the ssd after resume) but since the disk can be replaced, i\\'m not worried. thermals are acceptable, i think eventually i\\'ll need to re-paste in a year or so. idle temps are around 45 c. performance is great, can\\'t complain. initial setup is a pain though, wish dell would do more to configure windows to optimize battery life. i have an idle drain of around 8w, which calculates to over 10 hours of battery life when used sensibly. i am considering purchasing a dell xps 15 9520 with an i7, 16gb ram and a 3050 ti. most retailers i\\'ve found apart from dell themselves only sell the fhd screen unless you get the oled with an i9 for tons more money. if i were to buy from dell, i would have to pay £300-£400 more to get the oled than the fhd with the same internals (apart from ssd as the oled can only be had with at least 1tb). due to this, it seems as if it may be better to get the 1200p fhd non-touch option, as many retailers sell that spec often with deals and credit plans. would that screen be good enough for a 15-inch laptop? does the non-touch display still have premium looking glass on it? do i need touch? thanks i\\'ve had my new xps 15 9510 for a couple of months now and enjoying it overall, despite a frustrating wifi issue where websites will not load upon startup, despite being connected to the wifi successfully. if i disconnect and reconnect, it works perfectly for the rest of the session, then starts again upon restart. i\\'ve updated the wifi driver with the latest from the dell drivers page, but that didn\\'t have any effect. any suggestions? hi, i\\'ve been looking at the xps 15 on the dell website, and it seems like with black friday discounts, the i9 version of the laptop is $350 (usd) cheaper than the i7 version of the laptop, with the exact same configuration (uhd+, 32gb ram, rtx 3050 ti, 1 tb ssd). however, i\\'ve heard things about the i9 version being hotter, noisier, and prone to throttling. also i\\'ve heard that a bios update made it harder to undervolt the i9. how bad does the overheating get on the i9 model, and how much load does it take for the fans to kick in and become noticeable, either when the laptop is plugged in or on battery? does it start to get annoying even for small tasks like web browsing & watching youtube or do you have to be doing some advanced stuff like programming/video editing? and if you\\'ve used both the i7 and i9 models, are there any noticable differences in performance and battery life between the two? i will be doing high-end tasks on this laptop including programming, video editing, audio production, and gaming, and obviously the i9 is better performing on paper, but i\\'m worried about if the throttling will negate the extra performance, not to mention the possibility of lower battery life and audible fan noise for simple tasks. my ultimate question is do these annoyances justify spending the extra $350 on the i7 model, or should i just go for the i9 model? thanks! i\\'ve been looking into this and as someone who also has a macbook (for work), it\\'s extremely annoying. first, i tried disabling modern standby. i did the registry hack, but it doesn\\'t work, it disables sleep completely. i don\\'t have an option to disable s0 in bios (apparently got removed with some update). so i decided to try to debug it. running `powercfg /sleepstudy`, i saw something really interesting: my problem is not that the device is randomly waking from sleep, but rather it just drains while in sleep. i have a 52hr-long sleep state that drained 74% of battery. that\\'s 1.4% per hour, in sleep!? what in tarnation! my mac would drain *maybe* 5-10% in that time. is this normal? do i have a dud? is there anything i can do about it? \\u200b edit: mine\\'s the xps 15 9510, i7-11800h, rtx 3050ti i would love to buy the current dell xps 15 9520. in our office, we\\'ve got lenovo 65 wh docking stations all over the place, which is way below dells own power adapters. as we have shared desks, i would like to avoid taking the power adapter with me all day. question: any of you tried the dell xps 15 and in which configuration on a 65 wh docking station? does it work at all and if yes, how does it perform? is it worth to go for the smaller i5 which i can get with onboard graphics, or are the problems the same and i can go directly for the i7 with geforce graphics? i\\'ve had my new xps 15 9510 for a couple of months now and enjoying it overall, despite a frustrating wifi issue where websites will not load upon startup, despite being connected to the wifi successfully. if i disconnect and reconnect, it works perfectly for the rest of the session, then starts again upon restart. i\\'ve updated the wifi driver with the latest from the dell drivers page, but that didn\\'t have any effect. any suggestions? hi, i recently got an xps 17 9720. i am interested in upgrading from 16gigs of ram to 32. i am not sure if i currently have 2 sticks of 8 installed, or just 1 stick of 16? what is the easiest way to get this information without taking apart the laptop? i would love if i could just buy another stick of 16, but i am not sure if it is that simple? any advice would be great. thanks! happy to join your community as i recently ordered an xps 15 (9520) - my first dell machine, and can\\'t wait for it to travel from the us to my country! i ordered a version with 512gb ssd as part of a discounted configuration, and i am considering expanding the storage. would it be better to replace a stock ssd or add one more in a secondary slot? i\\'d love to use additional space for storing media/documents and for studying data science. also, would you recommend going for some pcie 4.0 m2 ssd (such as samsung 980 pro), or pcie 3.0 drives would be good enough? i found a nice discount for samsung 970 evo plus; however, i see only pcie 4.0 support mentioned on the dell website. will 3.0 work? last but not least, i studied threads about all that heatsink and thermal stuff but struggled to grasp what was better. your thoughts? i just got a dell xps 9520 i9 laptop with win 11 pro, i can\\'t get any of the usb capture devices i have to work correctly with my nintendo switch. on all 3 the video is fine but the audio is not playing or is very choppy. for example in mario golf the music doesn\\'t play at all but some of the game play sounds do but not all & not consistently. the background music doesn\\'t play in any of my games, all i hear is little blips of sound. sounds don\\'t come though in the recording either (i don\\'t normally record, just play games on my laptop screen). i do have listen to device checked in sounds/recording i tried these capture devices shadowcast (which worked fine with my microsoft surface laptop 3 also with win 11 pro) elgato hd60 x (i just bought this after shadowcast had issues on the xps) cloneralliance chert 4kc (i use this for other things but i tested it with the switch today) software i\\'ve tried: mpv (its what i also used on the surface), elgato 4k capture utility & hdml helper pro. does anyone have any suggestions to get the audio working correctly? i really would like to use my laptop screen to play my switch again, like i was on the microsoft surface laptop 3 & shadowcast, i recently bought an xps 15 9520, i absoltely love it but i have something to complain about; the backlit keyboard behavior is so annoying, especially when you are in a dark room and you stop typing for a few seconds and it goes dark... does anyone know if there is a way to change that? hi all - i\\'m seeking some advice on some network connectivity issues i have recently started noticing on my xps 17 9710 laptop. i purchased this laptop about a year ago, and only began encountering these issues a few weeks ago. every couple of minutes or so, my internet connection has been dropping, reconnecting, dropping again, etc. i\\'ve confirmed that these issues are linked to this laptop, and not an issue with my isp, router, etc. - other devices maintain a constant connection. my network adapter is the killer(r) wi-fi 6 ax1650s 160mhz wireless network adapter (201d2w) that came with the laptop. based on some online research i\\'ve done on this issue, it seems that this network adapter (and/or some of its settings) is often suspected of causing these types of internet connectivity issues, but i was not sure if any definitive solution had been identified. has anyone else run into this, and found a solution that works consistently? this was not a cheap purchase, and i am otherwise quite happy with the laptop, but these internet issues are a bit disappointing, and i\\'m hoping there is a fix. many thanks for any suggestions! i\\'m not sure what caused it, but i\\'ve noticed that my dell xps 15 or windows 11 seem to be confused as to charging my battery. with ac adapter removed, it seems to be reading and discharging properly. on more than one occasion, however, when i plug it in, it doesn\\'t start charging. with computer on i\\'ll see it immediately jump from wherever it\\'s at to 100%...therefore windows/bios doesn\\'t initiate charging. eventually, when i discharge enough, or turn the computer completely off, it will charge again. aside from doing a full discharge, is there a cmd prompt command to help windows or my bios sync with the battery again and not think it is at 100% when plugged in when it isn\\'t? thanks. hey guys, recently got a xps 17 7920 and i want to hook it up to my dell 1440p 165hz monitor. what do i need to make this work ? will a usb c to dp cable be enough or do i need to buy a dock for the bandwith needed for 1440p 165hz ? i\\'m trying to install ubuntu on an xps 9520, trying to do dualboot with windows, however i can\\'t, every time i try to boot the installer from the usb stick, it\\'s super slow, however every time to get to the ubuntu install screen it takes me about 15 minutes, and once i get there it crashes, and i can only move the mouse and it doesn\\'t go forward. i\\'ve tried different thumb drives, and different usba to usbc adapters, i\\'ve tried disabling secure boot, suspending protection with bitlocker, but i can\\'t get to the install screen. does anyone have any idea why it does this and how to fix it? im trying to embed an fpga into my laptop via one of the m.2 slots, but i have not been able to find any dimensions of the slot beyond the length, and im unsure wether or not it would fit. where would i be able to find that information. im planning to use this fpga (without the large heatsing) https://rhsresearch.com/collections/rhs-public/products/nitefury-xilinx-artix-fpga-kit-in-nvme-ssd-form-factor-2280-key-m want to be able to record something that is playing from the xps i have a 9710 and the boxes are checked to show disconnected or disabled and nothing is there using win 10 22h2 thanks hi all, i\\'ve been searching for a fix to this issue for months but no luck! every night, after i finish work, i shut down the laptop and everything turns off - no issue. sometime during the night though the laptop powers back on. this only happens when the dock is plugged in! i have turned off wake on power connected in the bios as i assumed something was power cycling and waking the laptop, but this isn\\'t the issue. i don\\'t have a network cable connected, just wi-fi. i\\'ve updated the laptop bios, the firmware on the dock is up to date, and i really just can\\'t figure out what is causing it. the only items plugged into the dock are two screens via displayport and a usb webcam. anyone got any ideas or seen a similar issue? edit: laptop is xps 9510 i find the usb standards a little confusing and currently looking for a away to (fastly) operate 2-3 sandisk extreme portable ssd v2 on one usb c port (usb 3.2) of my xps 9520. no other devices or ports needed - only usb c. the ssds are ~ 1050mb/s read and 1000mb/s write max. i am thinking about buying an anker 747 ganprime 150w to use while traveling. it would eliminate having to take multiple chargers. anker’s website states: “due to dell\\'s proprietary charging protocol, dell xps 15 (9500/9510), dell alienware x14, and dell mobile precision workstation 5570 will not be charged at full speed.” could i use the anker 747 to power the xps 15 (9510) while i am using it, or just charge the battery while it is powered off? does anyone know the difference in time it takes to fully recharge the battery compared to the oem charger? could using the anker 747 for powering and/or charging the battery during occasional traveling harm the battery or the machine? i\\'m planning to buy this laptop from a uk store (pricing and availability reasons) but i\\'m wondering if there\\'s gonna be an easy way to swap some of the keys for my own layout (it) would i have to replace the whole keyboard or can the single keycaps be swapped? both layouts should have the same number of keys so it\\'s only a matter of looks rather than missing characters, that\\'s why i don\\'t want to take half of it apart to change the whole keyboard part hi folks, my xps 13 9320 has been rebuilt from a fresh windows 11 22h2 usb stick and is really nice now with a much longer lasting battery. i am running all of the latest drivers from dell. however, when the laptop is on battery, audio in web browsers (most notable in youtube) pops and clicks regularly. anybody know of a fix for this? i\\'ve done all the various things like cycling \"audio enhancements\" and tinkering with maxxaudio pro. i was pretty frustrated when i bought my xps 15 9520 about how often it was turning into a very expensive \"briefcase warmer\" when i closed the lid. enabling the hidden hibernate option (i used the guide here, but there are lots of others online) solved 99% of my problems. although i dislike the extra step of start-->hibernate every time i pack up to leave, i do love the confidence of knowing i won\\'t burn through my battery while in transit. windows power management is such a mess, but this is a real headache saver. i know it doesnt work on all pcs, but it works well on my xps. thought i\\'d share for anyone else with similar frustrations. i\\'m not terribly happy with the response time of my xps 15 9520 4k (it\\'s more like nit picking really, i use it 95% docked on a 4k monitor and i don\\'t necessarily need fast rt) and i could have the chance to trade the machine with the same model equipped with the 3.5k oled which has much lower grey-to-grey values. we\\'re talking of 50-ish ms versus 2-ish ms. but, the oled panel has a very low pulse-width modulation frequency of 59hz, while the 4k has zero pwm. i don\\'t know how my eyes react to low pwm cause my previous laptop before the xps 15 had none, and no i can\\'t test before i buy. so it looks like a lottery. should i trade response time for potential headaches? i just bought a new xps 13 plus 9320. installed ubuntu 22.04 lts on it. it works well except for one thing. when i plug in the charger, the touchpad becomes laggy with a few milliseconds (very annoying). it\\'s hard to be precise with the touchpad. also, the cursor jumps randomly sometimes. if i do not plug in the charger, it works as expected. i\\'ve tested it on ubuntu 20.04 as well, and there\\'s the same problem there. the name of the touchpad in xinput is ven_04f3:00 04f3:31d1 touchpad i\\'ve tried to search around for a fix, but i\\'ve not found anything online. could it be a firmware problem or is it something wrong with the hardware? hi everyone. i\\'ve just noticed that my machine is not detecting updates from both the dell update app and the dell support website (which uses supportassist under the hood). for some reason, they are telling me i have no updates. however, when i check the list of recent updates offered on the dell support website, i can see that i need to update: the bios (currently 1.7.0, latest is 1.8.1), the nvidia gpu (currently 30.0.15.1272, latest is 31.0.15.1700), the intel wifi card (currently 22.150.0.3, latest is 22.170.2.1 but listed as \"3.1222.7103, a05\"), the realtek audio hardware (currently 6.0.9369.1, latest is 6.3.9600.2330), the intel management engine (currently 2204.2.62.0, latest is 2230.3.20.0), and the goodix fingerprint sensor (currently 3.4.39.430, latest is 3.4.39.460 but advertised as \"21.11.0.507, a04\"). i don\\'t understand why the automatic detection isn\\'t working properly but in case anyone else has the same problem, i suggest you check the dell support website. these updates are bug fixes only - no security issues were mentioned in the bios update. ok, now i\\'m off to download and install them. edit 1: added the audio driver because i didn\\'t realize that it also needed updating. edit 2: added the intel management driver because i didn\\'t realize that it also needed updating. i have a simple question. i hope. i have my xps connected to a wd19tbs. from there i have two monitors. a samsung g9 and an old dell 2414h. they are both connected via dp. it used to work and look good for work purposes. now the dell monitor is using interlaced refresh rate and all the text is blurry and annoying to look at. did i mess a setting up? can someone here help me start troubleshooting this? had a bad experience with the 9720 4k i19 i recieved. buzzing speakers and thermal throttling when only do some basic web browsing. so, dell are picking up the laptop tomorrow for a full refund. should i roll the dice again and get another one? or is there an issue with the 9720 units? many thanks. who\\'s the brave soul taking the first leap in? https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=5v4t2&oscode=w2021&productcode=xps-17-9720-laptop fixes & enhancements fixes: - fixed the issue where the admin password window is displayed when you run the pre-boot system assessment (epsa) in the bios setup. - fixed the issue where reboot bypass does not work after rebooting the system. this issue occurs when you set password bypass from disable to reboot bypass in the bios setup menu and install dell command monitor (dcm) version 10.7.0.232. - fixed the issue where the system stops responding at the dell logo while booting. enhancements: - updated the type-c dock override/audio/lan option to be unavailable when the video/power only on type-c ports option is enabled in the bios setup. i\\'m looking for a keyboard with a layout as similar as possible to the xps 9520 for working at home when using the hub and external mouse + monitor. i have the logitech k750 which is fine but i keep missing the keys, because both keyboards are too different. could be any brand. yesterday i had this set-up, working perfectly: xps 15 7590, wd19tb dock, two daisy-chained u2415s, and two other displaylink u2415s. giving me the 15\" laptop screen and four 1920x1200 displays arranged around it. today i\\'m migrating over to my new 9720 (upgraded almost entirely just so the screen size and aspect ratio more closely matches the external monitors...) and am having issues. the displaylink screens work perfectly. no issue. we\\'ll ignore them from now on. but the two daisy-chained ones (dp from dock -> mdp on display one, then dp from display 1 to mdp on display 2) refuse to play ball. initially both came up as 640x480 displays. windows sees them as \"generic monitor\" and installs \"digital flat panel (640x480 60hz) drivers. i tried downloading the correct drivers from dell and installing them but windows doesn\\'t believe/doesn\\'t care, it only sees a pair of 640x480 screens. i disconnected the second screen, and disabled dp1.2 in the osd of the first one. that fixes it. 1920x1200, nice. i then reconnect the second screen, and re-enable dp1.2 in the osd of the first one. ok, now screen 2 is 1920x1200, sweet! but, er, screen 1 has gone back to 640x480. i\\'ve performed this dance a few times now, but i cannot get them both to be recognised correctly. anyone have any bright ideas/experiences to share?! thank you is that a single sodimm stick? how much ram does your laptop currently have? theoretically it would work because the specs match the xps\\'s original ram, but i\\'m not completely confident in using 2 different brands together. ideally you should\\'ve opened up the laptop to see what brand it has so you can match them, or even better, upgrade both sticks at the same time. after installing some windows 10 and system updates last month, the fingerprint sign-in suddenly stopped working. sign-in options says, \"this option is currently unavailable,\" and in yellow, \"we couldn\\'t find a fingerprint scanner compatible with windows hello fingerprint.\" any tips? tpm 2.0 still appears to be present in the device manager. oh, dell. always, so close, yet, so far. edit, just restarted again after attempting and failing the goodix fingerprint driver install, and now it\\'s working and goodix fingerprint shows in device manager. curious. ive got a the following devices: xps 15 9510 (11800h) wd22tb4 huawei mateview 4k(+?) display x1 u2515h x2 (1440p) aiui, support for hbr 2/3 is dictated by the processor. the data sheet for the 11800h seems to suggest hbr3 is supported. with all 3 connected ( i’ve tried most combinations - the mateview connected by tb to either of the tb ports on the connector unit, the multi function dp and the actual dp), mateview only runs at 6bit color / 30hz. should i be able to run all 3 in some configuration? the docs suggest yes, but it doesn’t seem to work. hi, i recently bought the xps 15 - 9520 and wanted to undervolt it but i cannot for the life of me find any option to get intel xtu even started. also none of the bios options are helpful. intel xtu crashes with the following message: https://preview.redd.it/uc5egwu1ocy91.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c9dd67b7298787f63d5556df370a37db3908840 os : windows 11 pro windows build : 22621.675 anyone have any luck undervolting the xps ?? ok, i have no idea if these things are related, if i\\'m seeing some issues with windows 11, if i have a bum machine, or what. but i think tech support with dell will tell me nothing is wrong. i\\'ll give them (another) call, but i thought i would check in here to see if any of this sounds familiar. two issues: wifi: the wi-fi card is \"6e ax211 160mhz\". edit: i don\\'t think i have the killer drivers installed that i have read about here. how do i check? now i\\'ve always worked in a bit of a slow wifi zone in my house, but it\\'s still quite usable. but my 2015 hp omen laptop is way outperforming my brand new xps 15 in the same location when i run an internet speed test. maybe i just got lucky with that hp, i don\\'t know. is this just the way these wifi cards perform? any thoughts? the slowness of the internet is making this whole thing completely unusable for me. if i\\'m sitting in the same room as the router then it\\'s ok. but the range is just so much worse than my old computer. everything on this machine has been updated, and i had a call with tech support to remedy the issue, and they ran all kinds of tests and updates remotely, and they finally told me everything on the machine for wifi is fine and functional, both software and hardware. and indeed if i\\'m sitting next to the router then everything is good. one more thing - does this feel relevant? - i had a technician replace the screen the other day because the camera was bad. dell support told me that this repair did not change the wifi card. i didn\\'t really stress-test this machine before that repair, so i can\\'t be sure if the wifi issue is new or not. input lag: edit: so i just tried my dell latitude 5401 that i got from work, and surprisingly it also does this text lag! yikes! is this a dell thing? my ancient 2015 hp omen is not doing this at all! edit 2: ok i\\'m letting this one go. it doesn\\'t seem to be happening all the time. maybe there was some process running that was causing issues. this one is weird. when i\\'m typing in a text field in a web browser (like right now), there are occasional lags in the text input - the characters will stop showing up just for a moment as i type them, then maybe the last few letters will pop up quickly. i think you know what i mean - characters are not being missed, but rather show up a bit late at times. to really test this i put together my own simple html page with nothing but a <textfield> element in it, tried it in both chrome and edge, and i\\'m noticing the same occasional lags when i type into it. by the way, i\\'m also not sure if i love the colors on this screen...it\\'s all working correctly and i love the 4k resolution, but color accuracy is not super easy to attain here. i\\'m changing profiles in premierecolor but i hate that i am thinking about it at all. but maybe that\\'s an issue i\\'ll save for another post. right now i\\'m just concerned about the issues above. i have had xps 15 9550 since 2016. it has been my best laptop purchase ever. it is still working but has some issues like won\\'t turn on sometimes, gets buggy and slow, and has some dead pixels on the screen, etc. it has been my daily driver for more than 6 years and now i feel before it dies completely on me i should replace it with a new laptop. now i have been reading reviews about xps 13 plus, and most of them are not happy with their purchase since the laptop has lots of quality issues. but the laptop design is stunning and that makes me want to buy it. so i am confused should i go for the xps 13 plus or just upgrade my xps 15 with the new xps 15 model? any advice would be appreciated...thank you! \\u200b red line is where i see the bleed i bought a certified refurbished dell xps 17 9720 4k touch from the outlet store and recieved it yesterday. the first thing i did (after installing windows) was to run a backlight test as i had been burned on a previous asus laptop which this was meant to replace. however, i can see that on the right of the screen there seems to be some backlight bleed and while i admit i could being too harsh, i feel for nearly £2500 i can have those high standards. also, the trackpad seems a little loose on the right corner. for comparison, i tested it against the macbook 2021 16\" my work supplied me and it has no backlight bleed or trackpad issue whatsoever. my plan is to get dell to refund me in full (as my statutory rights in the uk dictate i can) but before i do that i just want to find out if this is something that you have to deal with when buying an xps, or do people have units without these issues? maybe i\\'m being a bit ocd about it but i don\\'t find these issues on mac products and while the logical position might be to just buy a mac, i can\\'t stand osx. admittedly, if i get a refund i\\'m not sure what else i could get that would be of an equivalent spec. i guess i would be happier having a cheaper laptop with issues than a expensive one. the money is what bothers me here. i recently purchased a dell xps 13 (9315). when i used it (right after unboxing), it started to make audible fan noise and warm up really quickly. i just opened my laptop, literally having only microsoft edge open (haven’t even searched anything) and the fan already started making audible noise. the laptop started to warm up on the keyboard near the screen. i have just set up windows and haven’t even installed any other softwares other than zoom. there is absolutely nothing on the laptop to be so heavy. is this normal…? i have already contacted customer service to exchange the system, and when the new one arrives it has the exact same issue again. i just go a new xps 13 plus about a month ago and noticed it had a dead pixel. i contacted dell support and got the system exchanged. the new computer arrived today and it also has a dead pixel. is this common with the xps 13 plus or am i incredibly unlucky? should i keep trying until i get a good one or should i get something different. i just got a new xps 13 plus about a month ago and noticed it had a dead pixel. i contacted dell support and got the system exchanged. the new computer arrived today and it also has a dead pixel. is this common with the xps 13 plus or am i incredibly unlucky? should i keep trying until i get a good one or should i get something different? just wandering whats the difference in battery life if any when you downscale the 3.5k resolution to fhd in the display setting on either the oled or 4k model hello! what do you think about it? i would like to buy this lock for when i use my laptop on the go. does it have any contraindications? do you think it can easily be folded for carrying in a backpack? or it would be better for transport to have a lock with a spiral wire (but i can\\'t find compatibility with xps 9720) ... https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/slim-n17-20-keyed-dual-head-laptop-lock-for-wedge-shaped-slots/apd/ab868415/pc-accessories#techspecs_section thank you very much. edit: *kensington edit: do you know if these products are also shipped from china, or is there a stock in europe?

should i keep trying until i get a good one or should i get something different? hey y\\'all. i have an xps 17 9710 and i wanted to reach out to get recommendations for high-quality keyboard covers. i\\'m always fidgeting when i\\'m at my laptop, eating near it etc. inevitably detritus gets underneath the keyboard keys. looking for recommendations for silicon covers for the keyboard. my main requirement is that obviously, it forms a good seal around the keys so that stuff doesn\\'t get underneath. the other thing is that i want to install it once and then forget about it so that this isn\\'t something that i\\'m having to remove and reinstall every time i open the laptop to use it. i don\\'t really care about what color the cover is etc. plain or tinted covers, both work for me. thanks for your help!! are there any ram modules compatible with xps 9520, which are not made by crucial? asking this as every other thread on this topic suggests using crucial modules, but those are simply not available in my country. from dell or nvidia? try reinstalling. i\\'m about to buy a dell xps 9510 and the wifi card is soldered on. is there any way to change the killer card? i\\'m also looking into the possibility of installing a wifi card on the second ssd slot but i\\'m not sure it\\'ll work. has anyone tried this or have any insights on it hi, i wanted to see if you guys could check the bt signal strength you get from your dell 9520, or similar devices. there are a few apps on android you can get, currently i am using https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.egl.com.intensidadbluetooth&hl=en&gl=us or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pzolee.bluetoothscanner&hl=en&gl=us if you know any better with maybe grath please let me know this is the laptop facing me at arms length on the right. if i put my hand or angle my head differently with pcx550 headphones the sound will cut of. sony xm4 earbuds seem to handle it better but this graph is from my phone at the same location as my headset. but given the graph something feels odd here... https://preview.redd.it/eygau558drx91.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=663988914d0a7f05a23ae23bed1f946ede414f0e i have an xps 15 9510. on very light web browser use, i feel the keyboard getting warm. my first question is: are laptops just destined to feel warm? is it bad for my xps to feel like its constantly hot? it\\'s brand new. i assume that its just how laptops work, but i\\'m just wondering. \\u200b my second question is: i have the rtx 3050ti. i play overwatch 2 on this machine sometimes; for 1-2 hour sessions. is this okay? the laptop gets burning hot and the fans go full blast. this is expected, but am i pushing it too hard, or is this what this machine was made for? obviously not \"made\" for gaming, but i assume this isn\\'t a problem to do light gaming. hello! what do you think about it? i would like to buy this lock for when i use my laptop on the go. does it have any contraindications? do you think it can easily be folded for carrying in a backpack? or it would be better for transport to have a lock with a spiral wire (but i can\\'t find compatibility with xps 9720) ... https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/slim-n17-20-keyed-dual-head-laptop-lock-for-wedge-shaped-slots/apd/ab868415/pc-accessories#techspecs_section thank you very much. edit: do you know if these products are also shipped from china, or is there a stock in europe?

i\\'ve been looking every couple of weeks since launch and still haven\\'t really found anything. are the m cases for previous version compatible? cheers! i am having trouble deciding which display to get for the dell xps 9520 laptop. i went to bestbuy and seen a comparison between the fhd panel (which is also ips like the 4k one) and the oled panel. i could definitely see that the oled was a bit dimmer (400 nits vs 500 nits), but the colors popped more and seemed more vivid then the ips panel, and the black levels were much better with the oled. i couldn\\'t see much of a difference in resolution between the two displays, even though one was fhd and the other was 3.5k. i am deciding between either the 3.5k oled or the 4k ips display though, since i would like one with a touchscreen. i am planning to do web browsing, programming, and gaming on the laptop, as well as watch youtube videos. i feel like the oled display would be better since it has better contrast and black levels, along with a lower response time, which would be great for playing games or watching videos. i am worried about possible burn-in with the display over time though, especially with static screen elements like window title bars. i was hoping to use this laptop for at least 5 years. i have read that dell added mitigation for burn-in with pixel shifting, and that newer oled panels are better with burn-in than the older ones. with the newer oled displays, is burn-in still an issue? i normally use my current laptop at maximum, or close to maximum brightness. i also read that higher brightness could cause oled displays to wear out faster, so i am concerned about that as well. there is also a screen door effect that i read about with the oled panels, however i didn\\'t notice this while looking at the laptop in the store, so i am not worried about that. the ips panel would have worse contrast, black levels, and response time, but be brighter and wouldn\\'t have the possibility of burn-in. which display would you recommend i go with? the pc is new, what a shame... i though that windows 22h2 was the issue so i resetted windows, better audio came back but my battery problem wans\\'t resolved. i tried to adjust the grafic settings but didn\\'t change anything.had the problem ? does anyone solved the problem ? on hwinfo i have 7w consuption when i do nothing but opening firefox (is the same for any browser) the value increase to 30 w sometimes more to 40 w. what should i do ?!? tried to uninstall dell support app too.. https://imgur.com/a/gynltqc grafic card https://imgur.com/a/9v9z4x7 edit dell xps 17 9720. thks i just got myself a xps15 9520, but damn. as many reviews mentioned before, the sound profile is terrible. i know it\\'s a simple \"turn off maxxon audio\" thing, but as i did, the sound locked itself at max volume and didn\\'t turn down. my question to the professional xps community is this: how do i make it sound better, without making the speaker go boom? got in an xps 17 9720 i7-12700h touchscreen 16gb ram and 500gb hd. upgrading the ram to 64gb crucial and want to upgrade storage, i’ve got three ssds i could use. 1tb 980 pro 4.0, crucial 2 tb 4.0 and crucial 500gb 4.0. i plan on using it for work and gaming. am i better off using the 2tb crucial to clone over the oem drive and partition off a big chunk for game storage or leaving the oem 4.0 500gb for storage and adding the 2tb drive for storage? thinking adding the second drive is just going to drain battery faster when i could just use the 2tb drive . my refurbished (but \"like new\") xps 9520 is working great, but the camera is dead. i noticed this when starting up windows for the first time, and the face-unlock setup thing showed no picture. i checked it later with the camera app and sure enough the camera is bad. a call to technical support was unable to resolve the issue, and they are going to replace the camera - sadly there is a backorder, though! i hope the part becomes available soon. so this is just a reminder to test that camera on your new laptop - because i\\'m no longer in the habit of using zoom, i could have neglected this until well after the service contract had expired! i suppose it\\'s a good idea to check all the other things i might not use until later - card reader, fingerprint scanner, etc. i have an xps 9510 2021 i7-11800h nvidia 3050 purchased in march of this year and having a weird issue with the charger. few weeks ago i was typing an email and when the battery got low i plugged up the charger and when i plugged it in, the light on the charger went out and windows restarted. unplugged the charger, plugged it into a different outlet and the c port on the other side of the laptop and again the light on the charger went out and windows crashed. unplugged the charger again plugged it back up but it wouldn\\'t charge for a bit but it started charging after letting it sit. after that a few times when plugging it up it would randomly restart and now every time the charger is connected the light on the front blinks but it seems to charge just fine. ran a battery health report the other day and its showing 25% wear with capacity down to 64kwh from 84kwh. the pre-boot diagnostics and the dell support assist both say no issues detected but i\\'m concerned about the fact that the led blinks when its plugged up (just one white blink. turns on for a few seconds then goes out and comes back on ). any suggestions or advice? title! bluetooth speakers + earbuds can connect but the sound cuts in and out unless the devices are like 5 inches away from the laptop. when its far enough away (as in, my head is at a normal distance away as i use the device sitting at a desk) i don\\'t hear anything at all and when i move back to being closer it lags until it catches up if that makes sense. i just got this computer a few months ago and didn\\'t have any issues with this first but now it\\'s been several weeks of trying fixes but no success :( has anyone had the same problem? what can i do ? trying to reduce the amount of heat generated during charging so as to preserve battery health on the long run. i already know the answer isnt \\'standard\\'(coz thats what i use), but i may be wrong. my laptop is the xps 9510, and i have the 130w charger. hello guys. please let me explain to help understand better. i have a dell xps 9510. while i am well aware this is not a gaming laptop, but for the game i played, it served me well when i got this laptop (less than 2 months ago) i installed god of war. it was running fine with 64-80fps (dlss set to quality). if my frames dropped or became bad, it was always between 60-62fps. hardly went below. i completed the game in peace. idk what i did, but these days i dont get that performance on the same god of war. prior to me noticing it, i hardly played the game after completing it. hadnt played it in weeks. when i tried it, i was getting roughly 45-55fps max. i turned on max fps, vsync disabled, high performance mode, turbo bost on, did the nvidia settings and windows settings to high performance on gow. i dont use battery boost or whisper mode in nvidia, literally nothing. same settings as it was when i first got the game but the performance is less. my drivers are up to date, so is my firmware and everything. my drive is not full, and my specs are quite decent (i mean i was getting good fps at first) my specs are - 16gb ram, 1tb ssd, rtx 3050 ti, core i7 11th gen, windows 11 22h2 (also i\\'m aware of the issue people got after upgrading to 22h2, but i had this issue even before upgrading) do yourself a favour and dont buy dell. i’m on windows 11. idk what’s up with my audio. it works but at the minimum volume of 2 it maxes out and gets super loud. not sure how to fix this. i have a dell xps 15 9510 that i bought just over a year ago, but recently i have noticed that battery life has been significantly reduced and i just have no idea why. even with power saver mode and brightness below 50%, i\\'m getting just below 2 hours. here are some specs: cpu: intel i7-11800h gpu: rtx 3050ti battery: 86wh ram: 16gb i have always used dell power manager to keep my laptop charged at 85% max as you can see below. the battery capacity still seems to be excellent too (at least according to the power manager software), so i don\\'t know what\\'s going on at this point. any input will be appreciated - please let me know if you need any additional information about the laptop specs. https://preview.redd.it/n3m4vkoaujw91.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=34530f99a5391165bcb639912a8e6ae41ba10c5b this ones a bit of a long story but i’ll try keep it short: i bought myself an xps 15 for uni, it got delivered and i set it up. 2 days after, i got a quick bluescreen crash and my laptop restarted immediately and it was fine. a few days later it happened again, this time it took 20mins of restarting into blue screens to finally boot up windows. so i call tech support, turns out there was a few updates i didn’t have. i install those, the next day my laptop completely bricks in a bluescreen loop and i have no access to it. i get a replacement sent to me. this was 2 days ago that my replacement came. and i’ve just experienced a crash similar to final crash on the first one, leading me to have no access to my new laptop. this time, dell tech support took me through an os reinstall which has fixed the problem for now, but i’m worried it’s going to be reoccuing. i should note that on both laptops i had installed practically nothing except all available updates on windows/dell update. (just firefox,discord,steam). anyone experiencing anything similar? i’m thinking it’s maybe a bad batch of xps 9520s we’re produced? thanks i recently got this laptop and i feel like i’ve looked everywhere for a good hard case but i’m literally only finding two, are there more options for hard cases somewhere that i haven’t seen? (i want a hard case, not a sleeve or protected sleeve) hey, so i just purchased the xps 15, i7-12700, oled, 3050ti, 16gb ram, 500tb ssd. the only issue is during the config process i am seeing the lower specs being sold for more? the 3050 non ti version of the above is $500 more? and same specs with fhd is $200 more than oled. now i am a bit scared as i dont want to have bought an inferior product or something with known defects - 3050 ti instead of 3050 and oled instead of fhd. \\u200b thanks i know its normal for a laptop to get warm while charging. but whats strange is, on the surface of my laptop, the left side gets warm/hot, while the right side remains cool. below, the whole laptop warm as per normal. but that surface side is what i dont get. is something wrong? also, its only the entire left side (where u can place ur hand and the keyboard). the trackpad also remains cool just like the right surface side. i have a 9510, windows 11. i recently bought a 2021 xps 15 9510 with the i7 11800h and the 3050ti. it has the 3.5k touch oled display. i bought this laptop used and it is working relatively well. i was having battery issues, along with serious touchpad input lag. it would at random start lagging really bad and precise movements with it were impossible. for whomever this may help, i found a solution for the touchpad input lag. i went through all of the apps from the windows settings, and uninstalled everything except for the windows and graphics driver applications. i removed all of the non-native windows applications and it seem to have fixed the issue. ***edit*** if someone knows how to fix the battery please lmk. it\\'s really inconsistent. sometimes i\\'ll get 8+ hours of battery and other times i\\'ll get 1-2 on the same settings. not sure what\\'s happening. so i am running into an issue with this system. perhaps someone here has had a similar issue. i have a 9710, i9, 16gb ram, 1tb ssd, windows pro. when using the dell dock wd22tb4 i have an issue where my two external monitors will not turn on within a reasonable time when the dock is connected to the laptop. when they do turn on, one will be active and displaying, and the other may not turn on. eventually they both may turn on. the monitor that turns on first is random. also, when windows does load, i have a notification that the dispay connection with the usb-c may not be able to display due to limitations of the connection. these are supposed to be tb4(thunderbolt 4) connections, so the left side ports should be getting ~40 gb throughput. by reasonable time, i am giving the system 1 to 3 minutes to show boot sequence notifications. currently dell is offering a system replacement, which i would rather avoid. any ideas? hey, so i just purchased the xps 15, i7-12700, oled, 3050ti, 16gb ram, 500tb ssd. the only issue is during the config process i am seeing the lower specs being sold for more? the 3050 non ti version of the above is $500 more? and same specs with fhd is $200 more than oled. now i am a bit scared as i dont want to have bought an inferior product or something with known defects - 3050 ti instead of 3050 and oled instead of fhd. \\u200b thanks just a rant post. the issue first started when i was unable to use the laptop unless it was plugged in. there was an amber flashing light at the battery status bar and after running bios diagnostics, the error code i got was 133 which is a battery issue. i then contacted dell support which was prompt with their help. the issue i have is how long it takes to order a new battery from dell. i received the quotation from dell a week after the incident, but after placing an order i haven’t receive any confirmation email. even replies from the quotation team takes a few days at times. even though the laptop works fine when plugged in, i still need the battery as i have exams coming up. this is pretty frustrating. hello. what do you think of this case for the xps 17 9720?

when battery is depleted there is no warning, just the computer doesn\\'t turn on, i have to charge it for a few minutes to bring it back alive, i was expecting that the computer would save some battery % to show a \"battery low\" screen or such. the computer is often freezing on the way to wake up from suspension (after the lid is open for example) \\u200b did you noticed these issues? do you have any fix? \\u200b thanks in advance. looking into getting an xps 13 plus reasonably soon and was wondering if it\\'s worth waiting until black friday. are dell\\'s black friday deals generally worth the wait? i already get a corporate discount. i\\'m looking for a good quality sleeve tailored (thick and zero play) for the current xps 15 chassis and i found one on amazon listed as a xps 15 sleeve but without a year model specified. i\\'m talking of tomtoc\\'s versatile a13 360 protective laptop sleeve. after a quick check the sizing seems a little off and on the larger side so i presume the sleeve was tailored for the previous generation chassis which is indeed larger. is there anything on the market that is specifically tailored for the new xps 15 chassis, except some super thin and not much protective sleeves? if you have tomtoc\\'s model is the larger fitting so evident and annoying? can anyone please share their vbios of their dell xps 17 9720 for rtx 3050ti? hi. so about a month ago i bought an xps 15 9500. ever since then i have been having really bad overheating issues with it and when it overheats, the screen freezes. i sent a message to the seller i bought it from because it has a warranty and they are offering me the xps 15 9520. does anyone know if the overheating and freezing issues were fixed with the 9520? i just got my new xps 17 9720 laptop, and i only have a week left for the return policy. what should i check to make sure everything is good. as stated in the title: this is an xps 9520, which i got from the dell outlet. it was listed as refurbished, same as new. i love this new laptop except - yikes!!! - the color management is insane. what the hell?!? i can connect with dell support, but i have a feeling this is a known issue and someone here can point me in the right direction before i go uninstalling and reinstalling drivers and all of that. here\\'s what has happened in my first hour of usage: started up my new computer, loved it, but the colors are over-saturated. i knew that might be an issue. decided to check out the dell premierecolor application, despite being warned it\\'s problematic. when i started it, and before changing any settings, the colors became extremely washed out and i struggled to get it back. turning hdr on made that go away, but i don\\'t necessarily want hdr on. now here\\'s the fun part: when i unplug the adapter and go to battery power, the colors completely change to this weird washed out look. can anyone break this down for me? faced with intel\\'s color management, dell premierecolor, and windows color management, i\\'m getting a bit lost. and why the heck would the colors change when i unplug the computer?!? all i really wanted to do was to explore color management to help me reduce the saturation of the colors, to make the screen better adapted for viewing my digital artwork. i\\'m looking for a portable battery bank to charge this unit on the go. i was about to buy an anker 737 (https://www.amazon.ca/dp/b09vphvt2z/) but they have sold out everywhere and support tells me they don\\'t expect more for a few months. any suggestions for alternatives powerful enough to charge the 9315? my existing battery banks don\\'t charge it. this is not a tutorial but, a confirmation of my suspicions. dell has reused the chassis for the past three years of the xps 15 95*0 line of laptops. this is not a bad thing the chassis is solid and it makes finding cheap replacement parts super easy. the locations of all of the ribbon cables are exactly the same between them. now for the differences, the two biggest differences i could find was that the cpu and gpu location were swapped requiring you to buy a new heatsink (if you just bought the motherboard bare) as well as the right fan. the heatsink difference requires a new unit while the fan can be reused from the 9500 by snipping off a mount and moving the cable. at the moment of writing this i have not tested to see the performance difference yet. side note: when i went to put my old drive in i got a bsod about how the boot partition was inaccessible. this was solved by doing into advanced startup and booting into safe mode. hope this helps someone with the same question as me. i just got a new xps 15 (9520). i like to get a second charger for my laptops, to have one for portable use and one semi-permanently routed behind my desk. is there a significant difference in charging speed between the 90w and 130w adapters? is it noticable, or is it just on the margins? is it worth it to get a third-party ~90-100w usb-c laptop charger for less? purchased a refurbished 9510 and loving how it is working overall. unfortunately, after 10-15 minutes of using it on battery power, the touchpad would begin to grow extremely erratic, jumping around the screen and clicking randomly. changing touchpad sensitivity and updating drivers did not solve the problem. bt mouse works flawlessly. opening up the back, it seems that maybe the battery is swelling, causing the issues? i tried loosening the battery screws to allow it to expand away from the touchpad potentially, and although slightly improved still going on. anyone else having similar problems and any fixes? i have also tried the tape fixes mentioned elsewhere to fix trackpad issues. i am have been using dell xps 15 (9510) (windows 11) for few months now and i have observed that there is a performance lag compared to that of hp elitebook 840 g8 (windows 10). i believe it could be because hp laptop is set for \\'best performance\\'. but for dell xps 15 there seems to be no option to change except for \\'balanced\\'. given that xps is designed to deliver highest performance, it seems strange that it doesn\\'t have this basic option when even my old asus laptop had it. i am wondering if there is a way to enable other performance modes on this model. thanks in advance! i’m planning on buying the dell xps 13 plus but i heard it’s having some quality control issues should i wait it out till the issue is resolved or should i go for something else just got the oled 9320, i specifically picked up oled because of the screen quality. however the screen is not uniform at all as seen below, although not as prominent in real life but still feels bad to have different colors across the page on a 2.5k laptop. this is especially visible on greyish colors, which is most of apps/websites in dark mode. https://preview.redd.it/dtrgdyak9iv91.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69e8c5f161ebe86542642b15c70b379642c3c3b i\\'ve decreased colors a bit in intel graphics center and that helps a bit by darkening things and making most of greys almost black.however, i\\'m curious if this is expected/norm? or should i try to rma and get a replacement or just switch to 4k ips? (but those blacks and colors make it hard for me to go back to ips) does anyone have oled 9320 that doesn\\'t exhibit this? also, have anyone figure out a way to adjust color temperature? i\\'ve noticed that all recent dell\\'s have a very warm color profile. but on ips panels you can use premier color to adjust temperature, unfortunately it says not supported with oled. and i would love to tone down some colors if possible, sometimes they are too much. oh, that\\'s totally normal. good ole dell quality control right there is what you got. send it back, don\\'t take a trade, don\\'t take a repair (your 30 day \\'return\\' window started when the order processed (,usually a few days before you actually receive the laptop)... and will expire while waiting on repair/replacement. it\\'s a shitty tactic that dell uses... moving from stock 1tb to 2tb 980 pro drive in my new 9520 xps (love it!). moving the os to the 980 pro 2tb. i don\\'t see any reason to swap drive slots, so i\\'ll go through the bios and set drive 2 to boot from. question: what is the best software to painlessly do this? i\\'ve used macrium, and various other vendors in the past, but i haven\\'t been doing much hardware changing or hdd/ssd formatting since i started a career in software engineering from hardware/networking (many years ago), so i\\'m a little out of practice. i just want to clone drive 1 (1tb ssd from dell) to drive 2 (2tb ssd samsung 980 pro) and boot from drive 2. i will eventually replace drive 1 with a 4tb drive, but no rush at this point. thanks! my 9320 was delivered today - beautiful machine. just wondering if anyone knows if it comes with a screen protector from the factory? i can\\'t tell if it has one on or not. i don\\'t want to pick it at and risk chipping or scratching the display... anyone out there know? just spent the last 30 min carefully tweezing out tape from the back vents of my xps 9320. clearly wasn\\'t meant for user removal, but i think the vents aren\\'t supposed to be sealed otherwise how are they supposed to exhaust air. has anyone else had their back vents sealed when getting their laptop back from dell repair? noticed there are three updates for my 9710 -dell update -killer wifi controller killer bluetooth uwd driver since i got screwed up on previous dell bios update. so i wont update until i see others updated without problems. so any fellows here update all three drivers and encounter problems? my screen is showing these colours as i\\'m trying to play in a full screen game. i\\'ve tried to update my driver\\'s and have turned off hdr and it still haven\\'t fixed the issue. does anyone know how to fix this, if yes please let me know hi, does to dell xps 13 9310 match the the windows 11 requirements with tpm etc? anyone knows? thanks. i have a dell xps13 9305 and its fully updated to windows 11 and whatnot. works wonderfully but chrome keeps crashing. when its open for longer than a couple minutes, it closes all the windows and then reopens a new tab and keeps all tabs/windows closed. after a couple cycles of this the computer starts to overheat. any ideas? which one should i get? noticed there are three updates for my 9710 -dell update -killer wifi controller killer bluetooth uwd driver since i got screwed up on previous dell bios update. so i wont update until i see others updated without problems. so any fellows here update all three drivers and encounter problems? its been almost a year since xps 9320 has been released. what has been your experience with it 6 months later or so? i have a few days before my return period is over. i\\'ve decided to test it out but i am running into a lot of issues right off the box. most of them has been addressed but my last laptop was a macbook which is 8 years old and still runs. im wondering if this will have the potential to last at least a couple of years. i got this laptop for personal use and i could very well get the latest macbook air with m2 chip instead which i know performs better and usually last a long time given apple\\'s track record. i just wanna give windows laptops a shot but its hard to look over so many issues especially when its brand new but still cost no less than macbooks. tl;dr the title as teh title suggest, performed a bios update as per the dell update wizard and the two usb-c ports on the right side stopped working. i contacted dell tech support and they downgraded the bios version, checked the usb-c ports functionality in safe mode and in bios and still no difference. i was told at this point i was told i should send my laptop to the repair depot at no cost but i\\'ve read some horror stories on here. its very strange since it\\'s only the two ports on the right that stopped working. the two on the left still work which included the charging port. any suggestions? bought my 9710 at is dell outlet, thinking to upgrade the ram 65gb but the staff ( electronic store in japan) told me that dell would lock ram slot and device would not able to recognize the new ram unless is bought from dell is this true? or it is only from dell japan? its been almost a year since xps 9320 has been released. what has been your experience with it 6 months later or so? i have a few days before my return period is over. i\\'ve decided to test it out but i am running into a lot of issues right off the box. most of them has been addressed but my last laptop was a macbook which is 8 years old and still runs. im wondering if this will have the potential to last at least a couple of years. i got this laptop for personal use and i could very well get the latest macbook air with m2 chip instead which i know performs better and usually last a long time given apple\\'s track record. i just wanna give windows laptops a shot but its hard to look over so many issues especially when its brand new but still cost no less than macbooks. tl;dr the title just received a new xps 15 9520. as i\\'m unpacking it and taking a first look, i immediately noticed that with the lid closed, the display connector ribbon is visible and exposed in the hinge. has anybody else noticed this on similar chassis models (9510, maybe older, maybe 13\" and 17\" models too)? has it been an issue? is there supposed to be some piece that covers this that i\\'m missing? hello y\\'all! just purchased a xps 13 9315 last week. it\\'s assembled in china, shipped in bulk to the states, and finally shipped to me like most customized orders. i was wondering how long does it take for the order status to change from \"build complete\" to \"shipped\" (in other words, how long does it take for the shipment to go from china to the states??). i just checked with a customer service representative and they confirmed that it\\'s already shipped from the factory. however, they couldn\\'t really provide any more detailed tracking information. some of you might know that there are two amex offers for dell which can be used together to get a decent deal... right now it seems like one of them will be expired before the order status changes to shipped (when my card gets charged). i\\'ve had this computer for about three months now, and the trackpad area is always oily in the exactly the same spots. i clean it often following dell\\'s instructions and other suggestions from reddit and the same spots reappear almost immediately. i\\'m wondering if some kind of oleophobic coating is wearing away. which one will be better? main things for me - display quality, trackpad sensitivity and reaction speed, battery life. i have been using macbooks last 10 years, but now all my tasks need windows ( upd: i am talking about x1 carbon gen 10 hello! dell did some cosmetic damage to my xps 13 (9310) during repairs. i love the computer and it’s working great. just has a few scratches now. however, dell is offering me a replacement with the new 9315 2-in-1 tablet. while it has the new 12th gen 1250u processor vs my 11th gen 1165g7, it doesn’t seem to have active cooling and is topping out at 9w vs. the 28w of the 1165g7. so would this technically be a downgrade? i don’t use tremendously powerful applications so i’m sure they’d both be fine, but i’d like to go with the one that’s “better”/more powerful if that’s possible to deduce. thanks a million for your help! hey all, i accidentally shut my 9520 with a pen in the hinge. the screen is not physically damaged but there is about two inches of damaged pixels running in a single horizontal and vertical line across the screen. i can’t find a single website that sells a screen replacement for this exact model. are there different screens that are compatible?

the other laptop i\\'m interested is the lenovo t15p gen 3 i7-12700h, but i didn\\'t find a good review and i can\\'t understand about it\\'s battery life thankyou! hello! dell did some cosmetic damage to my xps 13 (9310) during repairs. i love the computer and it’s working great. just has a few scratches now. however, dell is offering me a replacement with the new 9315 2-in-1 tablet. while it has the new 12th gen 1250u processor vs my 11th gen 1165g7, it doesn’t seem to have active cooling and is topping out at 9w vs. the 28w of the 1165g7. so would this technically be a downgrade?

thanks for your feedback! just updated the new bios.. noticed the battery will charge to 100% even i set custom max charge to 80% anyone had the same problem after a bios update on their xps or dell machine? and do u noticed other problem too? thanks. this has been proven effective on my xps 9720. unplug the adapter, and change to dc mode. click the battery icon on the taskbar change power mode to best power efficiency (default is balanced mode) \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/dg3dvarb9bu91.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20d27381f8b53c4e0e9a730b7c981c28bd5274a4 good deal imo just ordered an xps 15 today with a 1 tb drive, and i would like to dual boot with ubuntu. the laptop won\\'t get here until early november, so in the meantime i was thinking about buying the samsung 980 pro 2 tb, using it as a 2 tb single volume for windows, and then taking the existing 1 tb ssd and using it as a secondary drive for ubuntu. then i would like to hit f11/f12 whatever it is and choose a drive to boot from. my questions are: a) is that samsung a good drive for an os drive? anything better that i should look for? b) can you choose a boot drive at start like i suggested? can you just add a second boot entry in the bios? lcd suddenly got a black screen while using photoshop, previously, need to get it back by pressing the power button or restarting. updating drivers, and bios, and even reinstalling the os didn\\'t help. but i noticed that the problem was gone after the windows 22h2 update. my system has an i9 cpu, nv 3060 gfx, 32g ram, and 2t ssd. so i ordered myself a new xps 13 (9315) about a month and a half ago, and a couple dags ago i noticed that whenever i open the lid, there’s a slight sticking/creaking sound. there is also that sound when i close it. do i need to be worried? what can be done against it? i also have premium warranty for a year if that helps. just updated the new bios.. noticed the battery will charge to 100% even i set custom max charge to 80% anyone had the same problem after a bios update on their xps or dell machine? and do u noticed other problem too? thanks. this might be a stupid question but i\\'m considering buying the xps 13 plus and i\\'m wondering how do you change the volume? do you do it with or without holding fn because i really like it when you don\\'t have to use fn. has anyone been having freezing, and overheating issues ever since updating to 22h2? anyone know of how to resolve, my xps has practically became useless since updating. hello! i was wondering if someone could give me a bit of information. i am in the market for a new laptop. i\\'ve come across the xps 13 plus and see mostly great reviews on it aside from one thing, depending on the display choice, being battery life. i\\'m coming from a surface pro 8 which has been great aside from that very thing. so, my question is this: for anyone who owns the fhd 1920x1200, touchscreen model, what has your battery life been like, as far as basic usage? nothing intensive or overly demanding just generally light tasks. i see anywhere from 5 hours all the way up to 9-ish, so i am just curious as to what some of you might be getting on average. any insight on this is very much appreciated! from a previous post, i got a good prime day deal on a wd sn770 nvme drive and just upgraded a 6-year old desktop (z270, i7-7700k, 32gb ram) from a samsung 850 evo m.2 sata drive. while nowhere near the responsiveness of going from hdd to ssd for the first time, it does seem snappier and is benchmarking at near peak (i think) for pcie 3 (drive is pcie 4 but motherboard is pcie 3). my xps 9510 has the sk hynix pc711 pcie 3 nvme drive in it...i didn\\'t win the lottery and get a pcie 4 drive that i read some folks got. i\\'m tempted to upgrade when i see a great deal...though not expecting really noticable gains in performance. however, battery life is also inportant to me. how much more power do pcie 4 drives consume vs 3? recommendations for the best balance of performance and power efficiency? hello folks. i just bought a xps 13 (developer edition??) with ubuntu pre-installed. i don\\'t really use ubuntu, but i chose it when configuring to get that little discount. i know the typical steps of installing windows on computers, but would the steps be different for this laptop? ubuntu uses ext4 disk partition instead of ntfs. can i even see the disk or the partition during the installation? if not, what can i do -_- thank you so much!! as titled, dont install the new bios it almost bricked my laptop, the update frozen at bios update screen for like 1 hour. i had to forced shut down the machine and then noticed the camera setting was disabled and the battery management not worked as instructed. anyone had the same experience? at maximum volume the internal speakers on my machine are very quiet. this apparently has something to do with \"maxxaudio pro by waves\". here\\'s the issue- when this software is enabled on startup audio is slightly louder, but zoom and microsoft teams audio is extremely quiet. when this software is disabled on startup, then zoom and teams audio is louder but all audio is quieter and lower quality overall. this thread indicates it needs to be on for audio to be loud enough - https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/9mzk9e/comment/e7ig8qo/ \\u200b this thread indicates it needs to be disabled for teams and zoom to work properly - https://www.dell.com/community/laptops-general-read-only/xps-15-9550-volume-too-low/td-p/5051916 \\u200b there seems to be no solution where the audio works normally as it should. i got this machine yesterday and it is completely \\'fresh\\' and out of the box otherwise, with up-to-date drivers and windows updates. please help! as titled, dont install the new bios it almost bricked my laptop, the update frozen at bios update screen for like 1 hour. i had to forced shut down the machine and then noticed the camera setting was disabled and the battery management not worked as instructed. anyone had the same experience? i just got a new xps 13 9315 (32gb, 1 tb ssd, i7-1250u) laptop. the fan seems to be always on and is so noisy. only applications i have running is microsoft work, chrome and slack in background. is there any way to fix this? i did a bios update recently and i swear it has really improved my battery life. just went through a 1hr 40min lecture on 30% to 20% wtf! . this was on battery saver mode and on the cool preset and screen brightness at 40% but is was great. i was pretty disappointed with the battery life at first. with was just edge and onenote open though so not very demanding. has anyone else seen this improvement. maybe i had a setting turned on that did something idk. the new xps 17 (9720) looks great, but dell has always had a reputation for being a bit of a lottery... wondered if any one of the 8,000 members on this sub has one and had any thoughts on it? build quality, performance, battery life. cheers! i\\'m looking into an xps 9510 15 and i need 32gb of ram for engineering. i really like the arctic white, which i can\\'t find anywhere with 32gb while staying within my $1500 budget. would it be possible to buy a 16gb one and upgrade the ram to 32gb myself, and if so, how much would that ram cost? i\\'ve never customized an electronic, so i\\'m also wondering how easy this would be to do as a beginner; if it\\'s as easy as plugging in the new ram, or if it actually takes some skills to do. thanks! the new xps 17 (9720) looks great, but dell has always had a reputation for being a bit of a lottery... wondered if any one of the 80,000 members on this sub has one and had any thoughts on it? build quality, performance, battery life. cheers! hey everyone, i\\'ve seen a lot of mixed feedback regarding the xps 13 plus. some people say it\\'s amazing some people say it run\\'s too hot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzpwcpubr_0&t=30s i wanted to get some reports on the laptop in general, but also get some feedback if anyone is running linux on it? thanks in advance to everyone for your time and help, it is greatly appreciated! i\\'ve had my xps and pen for over 2 years now (both bought in august of 2020). i\\'ve never had any issues with the pen, however this week while writing notes in onenote the pen suddenly stopped working mid writing a word. i\\'ve found that the pen\\'s buttons are still responding and the pen tip can still operate as a curser, but the pen will not write in any program (i\\'ve tried it in onenote, whiteboard, and sticky notes). however, the pen will erase as if the button is stuck on erase. troubleshooting i have done includes; -replacing battery (it was around 70% when it stopped working) -redownloading the control panel/firmware -disconnecting and reconnecting to bluetooth -restarting the pc multiple times i can\\'t find anything online with this specific issue so any help is appreciated, i rely on this pen for college classes so i\\'m desperate to figure this out. eta- if needing a new pen is necessary, is there a pen anyone would recommend? i liked the active pen but there isn\\'t any stores near me that carry the pn579x, plus if there has been newer/better pen that has been added to the market since 2020 i\\'d like to know my options. thanks! how do i lower the cpu temp? mine does not have the water cooler on it. the stock cpu fan is terrible. is the water cooler worth it? what kind of water cooler/fan should i buy? are there any other recommendations to cool the cpu? i\\'m not worried about price. its already on sale in my countrys\\' dell webstore - but i can\\'t find more than 1 - questionable - unboxing/review video. kinda refusing to get a sp8/sp9 due to the case getting electricity on them - annoying! i just got this laptop 2 weeks ago and today there was a weird static sound everytime i clicked the trackpad, and it got \\'stuck\\' for a small time before releasing, so i couldn\\'t double click either. i saw some suggestions on threads that resetting bios to factory settings might help, which i did. but now there\\'s no feedback at all. does anyone know how to fix this? thanks i\\'ve used dell products for over 20 years and i have never seen a run of poorly made devices as this. i have the xps 9720 (upgraded from the 9710 - which had graphic card issues, lcd screen issues, audio jack issues) and they\\'ve sent me three devices - each with a defect straight out the box: ac power drops randomly, lcd screen had red blotches, windows hello worked poorly and sporadically, then the final one showed up with the ac power dropping randomly - again. the first replacement had to be repaired by the depot who replaced the motherboard; i guess this one will need the same. but good grief - whoever does the quality control at their factory needs to be fired and never allowed to work in technology again. whoever it is shouldn\\'t be allowed to work in a toilet. horrible on top of horrible and super disgusting and embarrassing to boot. take some pride dell. total failure hi there, i am wondering if anyone can help, i have a new dell xps 13 9315, everything seems 100% fine except when i launch mtga (magic the gathering arena) - as per attached. diagnosis is fine, all tests are fine, all other games etc are fine, except mtga... \\u200b dell technician had a call with me and tested all - all was fine, but we never tried mtga, does anyone have a 9315 with an issue like this? \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/hh6udkc8emt91.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a92b7b2a085c7f2bb31e2c7e688853e1b7aeaf9f how do i lower the cpu temp? mine does not have the water cooler on it. the stock cpu fan is terrible. is the water cooler worth it? what kind of water cooler/fan should i buy? are there any other recommendations to cool the cpu? i\\'m not worried about price. should i get the xps or inspiron? the xps has the gorgeous oled screen and more usb-c ports, but it’s also $750 more expensive :/ leaning towards the inspiron because of the 3060, and the fact that i don’t need 32 gb of ram and an i9 cpu xps 15: usd2,199. core i9-12900hk, 3050 ti, 3.5k oled, 1 tb ssd, 32gb ram inspiron 16+: usd1,450. core i7-12700h. 3060, 3k non-oled, 1 tb ssd, 16gb ram would appreciate some feedback if you own either the xps or inspiron, and how it’s been in your life! how do i lower the cpu temp? mine does not have the water cooler on it. the stock cpu fan is terrible. is the water cooler worth it? what kind of water cooler/fan should i buy? are there any other recommendations to cool the cpu? i\\'m not worried about price. with just google chrome open, youtube, microsoft office and hwinfo64, it hovers high 50\\'s and up to 70 c. when i play modern warfare, it gets to low 90\\'s c. so my dell charger broke and decided i\\'ll just get an adapter and usb c cable and charge that way. i got a 65 watt adapter and a 100 watt type 5a usb-c cable because those are the requirements to get full 65watt output. i just plugged it in today and checked my bios and it\\'s still only charging at 45watts. after doing some research, it seems that is the default for the 9310. just wondering if there\\'s a workaround for this? thanks i got the 750w psu, anyone know how much clearance there is and if a newer aib gpu would fit? this laptop is honestly great. i\\'ve been using it significantly more than my pc nowadays. the screen gets the job done as well. sure a bump in resolution(got the ~1080p version) is cool but a higher peak brightness and anti-glare screen are a great trade-off. it was heavy at first compared to my 13in thin and light but now i\\'ve been accustomed to it. my only issue so far is the lack of media skip key. does anyone know a hotkey or made a hotkey for skipping the audio track that\\'s comfortable to use on this keyboard layout? no problems here. it just installed fine without any errors (9520 i9). my dell xps 13 9310 has a really neat feature called lace. when viewing in a very bright environment, it increases the gamma / narrows the dynamic range so that the contrast is increased. obviously, contrast accuracy is lost in exchange for this extra \"artificial\" brightness, but it\\'s an amazing feature that gives you extra visibility in extremely bright environments. my issue is it only works when running on battery, if i plug it in, it\\'s instantly disabled. does anybody know how to enable it whilst plugged in as well? i\\'ve tried dell support but they couldn\\'t figure it out. i\\'m hoping someone here might know. i\\'m not sure if lace is part of microsoft, intel or dell. (please note, this is not a post about adaptive brightness (automatically controlling the backlight based on ambient light in the room). for content creators eager to disable that feature, it\\'s in windows display settings and intel command center. as content creators, i\\'m guessing you\\'ll probably want to disable lace as well.) hey, i just got a 9520 and wanted to see people\\'s opinions on how to protect their laptop. i am debating between getting the apparently trash mcover case or just getting a dbrand skin to protect my laptop. my main issue is the price difference, and i wanted to see what people have done! thanks so much in advance. i got the 750w psu, anyone know how much clearance there is and if a newer aib gpu would fit? my xps 15 9510 comes with the sk hynix pc711 pcie3 ssd. i have an old desktop with a m.2. sata ssd but capable of pcie3. i just picked up a wd sn770 on amazon sale with intent to replace the sata. it is pcie4, although not a super fast one. another option is to put it in this 9510. i\\'d rather not open it up unless i have to, but would i actually notice a performance increase? i don\\'t use the laptop for heavy copying of files. i also heard that sk hynix tend to use less power than other brands...though i\\'m not certain with the pc211. thoughts? my original thoughts when i found out about pcie3 in the 9510 is that if i upgraded to pcie4, i\\'d probably use a much faster drive than the wd. the right side remains cool btw. when i noticed it, i was plugged in via the port on the left. i allowed the laptop to cool down then plugged in via the port on the right, and it was still the left side of the surface of the laptop heating, while the right side stays cool. i use an xps 15, 9510 (fhd screen, 11th gen) is this something normal? or.... edit: i do not use expresscharge, i use standard charging mode, with thermals set to optimized. also, im not doing anything heavy. this happens when plugged it even if idle. sometimes, when connected to two external displays via 1 tb usb-c cable, the displays reset. it behaves as if the cable was swiftly disconnected and re-connected, but in fact it remained seated. seems like a software glitch, all my windows are re-arranged and i have to organize my windows again... did anyone experience this with windows 11 and xps 15 9520 ? local: 95035 or paypal accepted local $1450, or $1500 shipped timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/zpqotbx i am selling my like new condition xps 9320 plus with all accessories. pm if interested spec: intel i7 1280p cpu 32gb ddr5 5200mhz memory 1tb ssd 13.4\" 3.5k 2456x2160 oled touch screen windows 11 pro color platinum silver i did not record temps, but it gets noticeably hot. not too hot, but u wouldnt want to use it on your lap or bed, it can get pretty hot after a while.. i use 9510 btw, and on normal light usage. my xps 15 9520 arrived about a month ago and seemed and seemed to be working okay. in the first week it crashed or froze a couple of times but it was uncommon enough that i could ignore it. in the past couple of days however, it\\'s become extremely reliable with the amount of times it\\'s frozen. it happened mostly while i was watching netflix, about 4 or 5 times in an hour (the screen freezes and the audio jitters, thr laptop becomes unresponsive so i need to turn it off and back on again). i\\'ve been looking into the issue and i\\'ve tried everything i\\'ve seen- running system diagnostics, turning off panel self refresh, updating bios & drivers, etc- all to no avail. i\\'m honestly at my wits end at this point because this doesn\\'t seem like a problem a month old, high-end laptop should have. i\\'m open to any suggestion but would strongly prefer not to have the laptop sent away as i need it for university work (but if that\\'s what has to be done then so be it). as a temporary solution, i usually turn off audio enhancement then turn it back on and restart my laptop (xps 13 plus). does anyone know a permanent solution to this? buying a new work pc. looking at these two right now: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/xps-desktop/spd/xps-8950-desktop/xd8950adl30h?configurationid=28c9e802-3240-4761-b14a-77d7e5161f99 https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/workstations-isv-certified/precision-3650-tower-workstation/spd/precision-3650-workstation/xctopt3650us_vp?configurationid=d2c0e070-23fc-47db-b918-e92eb2d24fe5 not sure if xps quality is lacking compared to precision. also not sure if the jump to the 12th gen intel will be significant. it will be used for lots of multitasking and some light cad/3d modeling. i know the xps graphics card is aimed at gaming but i imagine it could handle the tasks i plan to use it for? and after the 1-year warranty is up, can i start buying premium support? and after the 1-year warranty is up, can i start buying premium support? so i tried everything i could think of. i downloaded the latest wi-fi card driver from dells website and all of the intel drivers as well but still no luck. so originally on the computer, before the clean install when i ran a speedtest i would get about 400mbs download which is my true internet speed because all the other computers in my house get the same speed. but after this clean install i’m getting 70 mbps. how could i fix this? delete all the partitions first, if you want to do a clean install. just a reminder make sure to backup everything. deleting partitions will make it impossible to recover data. the only advice i\\'ve been given for my 9320 is to perform a clean windows 11 install without any of the dell rubbish. preferably 22h2. it was worked normally and after an bsod it refused to work. i have tried everything: disconnecting the battery, all key combinations that i found online and nothing worked. i cannot enter in bios. after 2 min the cpu fan start to spin but is no activity just \"dell\" screen. i also removed the ssd and replace it whit another and whiteout it and nothing changed. \"fu#k you dell \" .i have bought it in december 2020 so....no warranty. memory usage looks fine to me. i\\'m about to purchase a 9520, and noticed that everything else kept the same (win11 home, 3050ti, 16gb ram, 512gb storage) the i9 option is actually $200 cheaper than the i7. i don\\'t really need an i9, plus i know it will just be thermal-throttled... but its cheaper. will a thermally throttled i9 behave worse than an i7? is undervolting an i9 possible with current bios (read somewhere that maybe it got locked out recently?). thoughts on whether i should spend $200 more and get an i7? so confused by why the i9 option is cheaper in this case but if its not going to make my life worse in any way then i\\'ll go for it to save some bucks i know, it\\'s not and exactly fair comparison since the size difference, but this will be a company laptop and i\\'m limited by budget. talkin about these configs: precision 17 5760: intel core i7-11800h (2,40-4,60ghz) (bnch-21743b) 17,0\" fhd+ 1920x1200px matte ips 500nits led lcd 16gb ddr4 3200mhz m.2 pcie ssd 512gb nvidia rtx a2000 4gb gddr6 wifi / bt / fpr / bez dvd win10pro 64-bit + win11pro 64-bit xps 15 9520: intel core i7-12700h (-4,70ghz) (bnch-26829b) 15,6\" fhd+ 1920x1200px antireflexný 60hz 500nits infinityedge led lcd 16gb ddr5 4800mhz m.2 pcie ssd 1000gb nvidia geforce rtx 3050 ti 4gb gddr6 wifi / bt / fpr / usb 3.2 typ-c / thunderbolt 4 / bez dvd win11h 64-bit so i\\'m wondering, is the 12th gen i7, ddr5 and bigger ssd worth the smaller display, lack of vaper chamber and just 2 thunderbolts (both on one side)? about me and my usage: programmer (java, angular, docker, electron (nodejs),...) and occasional gamer (once a few weeks valorant or something like a tomb rider, not really carrying about visuals as long as it\\'s 30+fps). ...ingly flawed, is what i hear from most short-to-mid term reviews... not only does it overheat, it underachieves for the hardware specs it has by a lot in performance, not to mention the battery also sucks. did i mention it is seriously overpriced? hey everyone just got my new xps 13 plus, i am switching from a previous xps 15. but i’ve been having issues with connecting a usb c external monitor. it’s the first time that happens with any laptop. my external monitor is an lg dualup (28mq780 b) which a new model, it also charges up to 90 w, every time i connect it to my xps plus in my computer i get a message saying “display connection might be limited” i can see that the laptops gets charged but no image. any suggestions ??? model: xps 13 plus 9320 i don\\'t want my brand new laptop to constantly be on charging mode in order to minimize battery depreciation but i do plan to use it mainly connected to my docking station. it seems the following steps work with 1 major drawback: my dell > power > settings > peak shift then select \"battery power\" for all days and times and set \"use ac power if available system charge falls below\"... for which i set it to 15%. the drawback is if i actually mean charge my laptop, i\\'d have to undo all the settings or wait till system charge falls below 15%. \\u200b tl;dr the title question there doesn\\'t seem to be any led indicator on the laptop (and i use a minix type c adapter that always have a led on). the only way i\\'ve found out how to tell is to turn on the laptop and click on the battery icon. it\\'s not as convenient when you are on the go and just want to plug it and check if it is charging. hey everyone just got my new xps 13 plus, i am switching from a previous xps 15. but i’ve been having issues with connecting a usb c external monitor. it’s the first time that happens with any laptop. my external monitor is an lg dualup (28mq780 b) which a new model, it also charges up to 90 w, every time i connect it to my xps plus in my computer i get a message saying “display connection might be limited”. i know the laptop has 2 thunderbolt 4 ports with power delivery and displayport but no results. i can see that the laptops gets charged but no image. any suggestions ??? this is more of a sounding board for myself, but hopefully i can get some good suggestions from the group here? should i use the option to lock in an order for the current xps 17 9720 model, or wait for a newer model in ?may 2023. i need it for the larger screen and higher brightness to let me work in outdoors areas. the weight and size is a plus too. the lg gram 17 is not sold where i live. \\u200b my current is an inspiron 15 5000 p75f, which is 15.6\" 220nits thereabouts, and 1.5kg. in the process of selling the gaming g5 15 10th gen i7 15.6\" 300nits and about 2.2kg. the 300nits was welcome compared to the 220nits which could not be used anytime outside during the day. the xps 17 offers 500 nits which honestly i can\\'t wait to use :) kind of an off question, but the trackpad stopped clicking this morning. i noticed that it still works by tapping it, but it doesn\\'t click towards the bottom of the trackpad anymore. anybody know what might be going on? dell xps 13 9310 so i got a replacement for my faulty xps 9510. on the old machine i had a neat option to disable drives in bios. that\\'s not possible anymore on the xps 9720 (bummer) anyways, when reinstalling windows with windows drivers i get an issue connecting a tb3 monitor (lg38wn95c) however i got it to work somehow by reinstalling display drivers, reinstalling the original drivers (the oldest from dells support site) and after that i was able to get video out. but only from one single usb port...port 3 what makes this stuff even weirder is multiboot. i wanted to have two separate windows installs but whenever i get the gpu working on one drive, the moment i install a second version of windows it just gets painfull. while in the windows boot manager i get grey and purple lines and graphic bugs (but only there!!!) windows boots normally but i don\\'t get the 3060 to work to display video to the external monitor again... i\\'ve reinstalled windows now like 7 times, tested everything with drivers but i am really at the end now... any ideas? hello, i’ve had this dell xps 15 9520 for two months now. specifications intel core i7-12700h 32gb ddr5 ram nvidia geforce 3050 ti 4gb 1tb ssd 15.6 fhd+ non-touch screen i use the laptop exclusively for work (day trading) i usually have two browser windows open with maybe 5 tabs each with stock charts on maybe half of the tabs. my broker software is running which is very lightweight. also i have obs studio running only for recording the screen no streaming. it does seem that when i start recording the fans start to work more. the laptop always runs smooth with no lag or slowdown. the only problems i have is that the fans seem to turn on all the time and the battery life is not that great. though the battery really isn’t a problem for me because i have the power adapter connected when working. i don’t have a problem with the heat of the laptop as it is propped up on a laptop stand and is also connected to a second monitor (it does get hot i suppose, but it’s never on my lap so i don’t really notice it) even though the laptop runs just as good/smooth with fans on or not the noise does get annoying at times. i also have noticed that the fan noise has been getting more frequent in the past two weeks. for the first month it seemed to be quite quiet. was wondering if there are and ways to fix this? it seems that i’m not running it through heavy load for the fans to be turning on. overall the laptop is good wish they could have improved the fan issue and some better battery life. any way if anyone has had an issue similar to this or has some advice on how to make it run quieter please chime in, would appreciate it. so i just bought an xps 15 9520 today, i7-12700h, 3050, 16gb ram and 512gb ssd. it comes factory with windows 11 and i heard bad things about windows 11 in terms of power consumption and battery life, especially when paired with intels new 12th gen processors plus i have all the bloated dell software. i was thinking about doing a clean install of windows 10 that way im off of the power hungry windows 11 and i debloat it from all unncessesary dell software would that be beneficial in terms of the computers battery life? i just installed the new update and it\\'s really good. everything is a lot smoother and feels more responsive. finally got back the drag and drop in app icon feature. didn\\'t notice any issues with this update. my pc could be idle(but plugged in) and the fans just start blowing at almost full force for like 2-5mins then everything goes back to normal. and this is without any heavy load or background processes. my model is the 9510 i would like to install linux alongside windows with a dual boot on my xps 9520, however, i was wondering if this will void the warranty. i just got this model and it comes with windows on it. so i create bootable usb with the latest ubuntu version on it, and every time when i try to start the booting and installing process ether it freeze it on the first step (after i choose \"try or install ubuntu) or it got black screen - where just the mouse is shown. i disable the bitlocker in bios but do i miss something else or how can i debug it further ? \\u200b https://freeimage.host/i/qfpyhp https://freeimage.host/i/qfpbpv https://freeimage.host/i/qfpptb - bios options just got this in my inbox. that\\'s right, dell want to send me an entire new xps 13 plus 9320 because my oled screen \"might\" become detached. for those of you asking, no i don\\'t get to keep the old one. https://preview.redd.it/15vtdtx6pwr91.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4ce56e515305edbcd1607df6ca148ee163d06e hello i am replacing my 2 in 1 9310 as i am fed up with a few minor issues. giving this to my partner as she needs a new laptop and its a huge upgrade for her. i rarely use it in tablet mode so wont really miss that aspect. was wondering how performance and battery life would compare on the newer normal xps 13. is it the same type of keyboard? any ideas? thanks just purchased this dell xps 9310 and i\\'m pretty impressed with the quality and speed of the machine. i came from a vostro 5000 series which was good but wasn\\'t no xps and while i had that i wanted a lid skin/wrap for it but it was pretty hard to find one. since owning this xps i see plenty but for the people who have already purchased and installed one where is the best place to order from? example more choice of style best quality. just got my dell xps 15 9520 and it comes with a 130w charger which is great but i would i rather slowcharge the laptop to prolong battery lifespan over time rather then constantly fast charging but when i\\'ve plugged in my 25w or 45w charger from my samsung phone dell power manager comes up with a message saying charger to slow use 60w minimum. and when i do plug in those charger the battery icon has a warning next to it so can i not charge it lower 60w. if so is there a way of turning off fast charge like you can on phones. in history dell always release a 2 in 1 version of its clamshell design, so i wander weather xps 13 plus will have a 2 in 1 version like xps 13 9315 in later years? i am trying to make sure none of the maxxaudio apps auto-install as they are impossible to remove/delete permanently. hi, looking for help and recommendations to find a nice ultrawide monitor for my xps 9520. ideally, i\\'d like to charge and display the 9520 via the thunderbolt cable. i\\'m not sure exactly how much power the monitor needs to output to do this. i believe the 9520 comes with a 130w charger. i use a standing desk, so it\\'d be great if the monitor comes with a movable stand. i don\\'t mention size for the ultrawide because i\\'ve never owned/used one. i\\'ll assume a 34\\'\\' will be enough since i\\'d like to be able to display 3 windows horizontally. help is much appreciated! i have a xps 15 9510 with the killer 1650 card. at a range of about 10 feet from linksys ea9500 wifi 5 router, gigabit isp connection, and 867 mbps link speed, i get about 290 mbps download speed (from speedtest.net). is this what i should be expecting with this hardware? if not, is there settings i need to change? i\\'m about to buy the xps 13 plus, i noticed that it\\'s about £120 cheaper if i have it come with ubuntu instead of windows 10 home. i can get free windows product keys through my work, so is there any good reason why i can\\'t just buy the ubuntu version and then install windows 10 myself to save a bit of money? would it perhaps mess up the warranty or something? i have heard that people have been having issues with the xps 13 plus in the long run and that re-installing windows without any of dell\\'s drivers solves the issue, so it\\'s very possible i\\'d have to do a clean install anyway. hey! i\\'m looking into getting a new laptop, and i was wondering which was better value. i have two offers lined up for used xpss: the oled 9510 for 1000 and the 9320 fhd for 1100. i looked into both, and i am mainly going to be programming on it for school. while i like the nice, sleek design of the 9320, i thought that maybe the 9510 would be better since it\\'s bigger and had 3050ti. however, i wanted to get some other opinions out there. could you let me know what y\\'all think? i received this xps 15 9520 as a replacement (first unit had a myriad of problems). next day i open the lid and this happens https://imgur.com/a/5qu0lxt the oled screen is not properly attached to the body. with my first unit i went through 3 repair jobs over 1 month and a half. the tech ended up damaging the motherboard and they had to replace the motherboard and after that the dedicated nvidia gpu stopped working. now that. also the new unit suffers of coil whine. i\\'ve spent so much energy writing emails and dealing with incompetent reps and technicians. the technician who damaged the mb while repairing my xps didn\\'t know where was the gpu. he pointed to the chipset and said that you\\'re gpu when i knew that the nvidia gpu is right next to the cpu under the heatsink. it\\'s my first dell computer and i\\'m exhausted. i just lodged another claim for a replacement as i don\\'t want to go through repairs again. i\\'m at a point where i want to fix the screen myself and call it quit, i just need a working laptop. does anyone know how screen are attached to the laptop body from factory? do they use glue? wondering if i can just glue the screen back against the panel and be done with it. i can live with the coil while instead of having to go through the lottery again. sorry just venting off my frustration looking to buy one of these in november - do you think they will start selling these with the new i9-13900k thats been announced or are they not compatable ? - i was looking at ones with i9-12900k, thanks all. after updating to windows 11 22h2, my headphone jack no longer outputs most computer audio. the laptop still recognizes when headphones are plugged in and is even able to play system sounds every so often, but other than that nothing works. i\\'ve tried reinstalling all my audio drivers, disabling and reenabling processes, nothing works. any ideas? nope. typing this from one. i just received mine... model is 9315. i\\'ve not found any 3rd party accessories yet. the dell keyboard/cover that you can get with the laptop adjusts to 2 or 3 \"stand\" options. (but you need to peel it off from about where the back camera is and slide it down to its next \"attachment point\". it\\'s a really shifty design, but the keyboard on it is really nice ) one upside to dell is you can get it with an i7 (i don\\'t really know much about surface pro 9, ut i used to have a surface 6... this is a nicer tablet overall than my surface was, but the surface had 2 very important parts i liked a lot more than the dell (the built in \"kickstand\" and the micro sd card slot (the dell doesn\\'t come with either). hope that helps out of curiosity, how much more power does a laptop discrete gpu use over integrated? how much battery life would i lose. laptop is a dell xps 9510 w/ 3050ti discrete gpu and 11th gen intel cpu. my new xps 13 plus recently has started doing this thing where the touchpad uncontrollably spams clicks when i’m not even touching it the only way to get it to stop is restarting the computer but sometimes that doesn’t even fix it. has anyone had this? any tip for what i should do? hello, is anyone else having problems with a lagging mouse curser with their 9320? any tips on how to fix it? like the subject says. i was able to click download and it for a bit earlier this week, but it kept failing. then it disappeared on reboot i see a bios 1.10 is out on the website but i’m leery to update to install it till its on dell update. is that the update im waiting for? on the dell (us) website, the 9720 can be configured with an i5, no dgpu, with the 4k screen. this seems like a perfect combination for me, and i was wondering if anyone else has chosen this config, and if so, what has your experience been? my main concern is battery life under light browsing/coding. the larger screen i understand will take some power, but i\\'m hoping for the enormous battery to overcome that. hey all, i\\'ve recently reinstalled windows 11 on my xps 9520 due to stability issues i started having a few days ago. the reinstallation went well, but i have a couple questions now that it\\'s done. this one might be silly, but i just don\\'t remember my laptop doing this before. is it normal behavior for the battery indicator light to shine solid white for about 5 seconds after booting the computer (when not plugged into power)? i primarily ask because i had to hard power off the computer (holding the power button for about 10 seconds) a few times prior to the reinstall and want to make sure this isn\\'t some sort of diagnostic light indicative of any damage the hard power offs may have caused. i\\'m using dell command | update (universal version) to reinstall all the computer\\'s drivers. this is the first time i\\'ve used the program and i cannot adjust any of its settings because they are all greyed out. does anyone know why this is? thank you for any and all help! when i use my headphone jack on my xps 15 9520 the bass is really weak. this is with the maxx audio turned off. compared with my iphone using the same headphones, there is a noticeable difference. i\\'m not sure if my speakers are also being affected because i have no comparison but the bass also seems lackluster. is there a fix? hello everyone, i have recently been experiencing my laptop freezing when i wake it up from sleep. it\\'ll be on the lock screen but won\\'t give me the option to unlock with face recognition, fingerprint, or pin because the laptop would freeze. it\\'ll eventually reboot and bring me to the blue screen letting me know my laptop didn\\'t boot properly and to restart. if i am impatient and don\\'t wait for that to happen then the only solution is to push the power button to turn off the laptop and reboot. anyone experiencing this as well and is there a solution? hello everyone, i posted this in r/dell as well. hope that\\'s okay. i have just purchased a wd22tb4 dock and am having an issue with refresh rate. if i connect the dock to my xps15 and then from the dock to my monitor with a dp 1.4 cable, the best i get is 4k @ 60 hz. i have a usb-c to dp 1.4 cable and when i connect that to the dock i get 4k @ 144 hz. i know i can just use that cable but i am wondering why the regular dp 1.4 ports only produce 60hz. am i missing something? my setup: dell xps 15 9520 eve/dough spectrum monitor 4k @ up to 144 hz wd22tb4 dock any thoughts would be appreciated. thanks! as it says in the title, i been waiting for my xps 17 9720 (2022) i7 12700h with 1920x1200 500nits display and a 3050. 16gb ram and 4 years accidental damage support. after 6 months waiting i finally got the delivery. with a supposedly pleasant surprise of an i7 r2. yes to beefier cooling and also bragging rights. and a upgrade to a 3060. wow i just realised the xps 3050 is 4gb and this 3060 is 6gb, far off from the desktop 12gb version.. anyhow, the alienware comes with a 1080p display but is rated at 300nits only down from the 500nits of the xps 17. also i just realised, it is a whooping 3kg up from 2.2kg for the xps 17 2.5kg i wanted this for the brightness for working outdoors in sunlit areas (yea nomad wannabe...), and the weight for mobility. in summary, what should i do? pros alienware oooo nice 3060 nice cons display 300 nits down from 500 nits weight 3kg up from 2.2 or 2.5kg looking at the specs i\\'m limited to 2 drives on my dell xps. is there a way to install more? i have an unused sata port on the motherboard but i didn\\'t see the drive when i added it. i\\'m running esxi if that makes a difference. i also had to use an external network card so that slot is used (i have a m2 slot already used so i\\'m talking about ssd/spinning drives, for some reason esxi won\\'t see the 2nd m.2 installed but will with a usb case). i am planning to buy a skin for my precision 5570 and can’t find anything specific for it. will i be able to use the skin designed for the xps 9520 on my laptop? skin thank you for any help or suggestions i\\'m eying this inexpensive thunderbolt hub from dockteck for my xps 15 9520 and i was wondering if anyone has experience with it or something similar. i\\'m a bit worried of having power, ethernet, 4k hdmi, a keyboard and the occasional drive running on the same tiny usb-c but i guess this is what thunderbolt is designed for, right? also some specific questions: -my 9520 has a 130w power supply, can i plug it through this 100w-rated power delivery port? -can different usb-c to hdmi adapters impact image quality or it\\'s a simple 1 to 1 conversion with no chance of degradation? recently my xps has refused to play any type of video ranging from youtube (stuck at loading video) to even viewing discord streams. ran multiple diagnostic tests but no errors detected. please advise just got the xps 15 to use for work, but the problem is since i can\\'t use the 3050 in it to drive my monitor, i have to use the igpu and doing some work its struggling to do it, with multiple windows open just resizing one, i\\'m getting some stuttering and task manager is showing 100% usage of the gpu, and then doing some things in a browser window, it\\'s again constant 100% usage and stuttering, it\\'s so frustrating to see when at the same time the 3050 is sitting there at 0% usage. is there any fix or do i just need to return and get something else? my xps17 (9720) has 3 usb-c ports. two on the left are named \"thunderbolt and power delivery\", then there\\'s one on the right. can i connect my charger to the left side port to charge the laptop? i recnetly got a 1440p/170hz monitor and would like to use it for productivity work with my laptop. the hdmi connection only displays 1080p/60hz so i got a usbc to dp cable but it doesn\\'t output any signal to the monitor. i tried connecting to all usbc ports on the laptop but no success. does anybody have the same issue/know why? https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/b0895f8vb8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1 this is the cable i got i have an xps 13 9315 (non-touch screen) running windows 11, purchased a few months ago, and pretty much since i\\'ve gotten it, the touchpad will occasionally behave oddly for short bursts, always with two-finger scrolling gestures. usually it happens after i\\'ve been using the laptop for a bit, maybe around an hour, and usually stops after 5-10 minutes. essentially the two-finger scroll will just cease to function, like it\\'s not recognizing that i have a 2nd finger on the trackpad, and the cursor will move instead. i\\'ve searched around and while i haven\\'t seen this issue reported for this specific model, it does seem like people have other touchpad issues with xps 13s, but i haven\\'t seen any definitive solution. i have disabled three and four-finger gestures as i never use them and have seen some suggestions that turning them off can help the touchpad function better. the device manager has always said my drivers are up to date when i checked, and i keep the computer otherwise up to date with windows update and supportassist. since the issue is always limited to 2-finger scroll and there are never issues with clicking or normal cursor navigation, and isn\\'t a constant problem, i am hoping it\\'s not the hardware. just want to see if anyone has any other advice or possible solutions, as if it\\'s simply a software issue i can solve with the right combo of updates, i\\'d prefer that to having to get dell to work on/replace the touchpad. thanks! having the exact same issue as described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/q7gkhq/bluetooth_is_terrible_and_random_soft_bricks_when/ connecting a monitor to any usb-c port via a usb-c to dp cable, or hdmi via the included dongle causes so much bluetooth interference that any bluetooth headset is unusable in conference calls. tested with multiple monitors, cables, and headsets, all exhibit the same issue. disconnecting the monitor immediately resolves the issue, this is reproducible 100% of the time. phoned dell\\'s amazing (/s) tech support and was told that people writing articles online \"don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about, it\\'s too technical for them\" (that\\'s a direct quote) and basically denying that this is a design defect in the laptop. i\\'m past the 30 day window so i\\'m assuming there is zero chance for any exceptions to be made regarding a refund so that i can purchase a functional product. this is more of a warning to anyone looking at these machines, test everything within your 30 day window or you will be hung out to dry. i recently got a 1440p/170hz monitor and would like to use it for productivity work with my laptop. the hdmi connection only displays 1080p/60hz so i got a usbc to dp cable but it doesn\\'t output any signal to the monitor. i tried connecting to all usbc ports on the laptop but no success. does anybody have the same issue/know why? https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/b0895f8vb8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1 this is the cable i got i\\'m using an xps 9315 laptop with a wavelink dock. this dock works fine, but it doesn\\'t charge, so my only other usb c port gets eaten up by my charger. any way i can get a different dock that charges as well? i have an xps15 9520 with 86whr battery but would like a bit better battery life, so i was wondering if there are any aftermarket options for a 97whr battery or other batteries with 95-100 whr capacity available that fit the 9520 i just got my new laptop, i wanted to know what the best settings for this software should be for the a good audio experience on the laptop speaker. its got maxxbass, details, width as the options as a dial. ok folks i really tried to see if this had been discussed or solved elsewhere but i just can\\'t seem to find anything. when in hdr mode on my xps 13 9320 with the oled display, blacks are \"lifted\" and a bit grey. a classic example is the lg oled demo video that is available on youtube: https://youtu.be/njx2bu-_vw4 in sdr mode, that video has perfect un-lit blacks as the video starts. in hdr mode, it is obvious the panel is partially lit, leaving the blacks a bit grey. here is what i have tried to fix it: updated video drivers updated oled firmware windows 11 hdr calibration ensure the panel is set to 10 bit colour via the intel iris xe settings something interesting though is that when the panel is in sdr mode and i run the netflix app to play hdr content, netflix says \"dolby vision\", brightens the display greatly and appears to be playing in hdr, with excellent blacks. if i run netflix with windows in hdr mode however, the blacks are lifted and grey. is this some kind of weird panel configuration in hardware that cannot be tuned out? or something else entirely? note that my desktop pc has an alienware aw3423dw display and does not have this issue. that alienware is, however, a displayhdr \"trueblack 400\" certified display, if that means anything. ok, i\\'m stoked. right out of the box, my brand new 9720 (bought in august) had a bad case of the infamous xps hibernate/sleep problems. it crashed every single time it hibernated (i had to disable hibernate via powercfg), and sleep was glitchy, unreliable, and hot. i haven\\'t had time to warranty it, but i thought i would have to, even though i had zero confidence that any fixes or even a brand new unit would solve the issue. then last night i got served an automatic update via windows update: \"dell, inc. - firmware - 0.1.10.0.\" before i had a chance to install that one, i also got served the big 22h2 windows 11 update. when i completed all updating and rebooted, i re-enabled hibernate and tried it — and it worked. i was floored. i would guess that the firmware update is responsible for the fix, but i don\\'t know. i couldn\\'t find any details online about this particular firmware update, and it\\'s not offered on the dell downloads page for my machine\\'s service tag...maybe it\\'s packaged in with 22h2? sleep mode still runs hot, of course, thanks to the well-known follies of microsoft\\'s crusade for s0 standby (i\\'ve tried everything to enable s3 sleep on this machine, and it\\'s literally not possible). it\\'s incredibly dumb that you can\\'t just close the lid on an xps and put it in your bag without baking it like a cookie. and the sleep mode on my machine is still kind of glitched out even after the update, although i can\\'t guarantee that\\'s not a result of my own spree of tweaking every possible setting and group policy to try and fix it. but for my use case, hibernate is way more important than sleep anyway, so now that hibernate works, i have zero buyer\\'s remorse for either the 9720 or windows 11. hi, recently got an xps 9320 after having read that it runs certain games pretty decently. i’ve been running league perfectly other than the fact that consistently at about 5 mins into the game, my fps will drop from 230 to 5 and will stay like that for the rest of the game, anyone got any advice or am i just not meant to play league on this laptop? i’ve tried capping the fps and it hasn’t helped. hello, iam looking for best laptop with best performance, with 15.4 od 15.6\" screen. so far best chose is one of them from title. in simillar price range which i should chose? main pros for thinkpad is case, and keyboard for me. purpose: data science what will you chose and why? hello, idk what i did, but i no longer get max frame rate in games. let me explain. i have an xps 9510. i installed god of war, i was able to achieve up to 85+ fps on high settings (dlss enabled). everything is still the same from when i got the laptop (literally less than 2 weeks) and now i get get more than 60fps. its as if its locked to that 60fps range. idk what happened but is there a way i could fix it? if someone could explain this to me i would really appreciate it, i just got a xps 15 9520 with the i7 and 3050. i want the 3050 to be driving the external display, it\\'s a samsung crg9. is there any way to do this? i haven\\'t been able to figure out how to get it to use the 3050 for anything. here is a link to my original post that has more details: (1) xps 13 9310 2-in-1 keyboard randomly stops responding, have tried many methods to permanently solve this issue, but no luck. please help!! : dell (reddit.com) basically, my laptop was purchased over a year ago, the keyboard started to regularly not respond after about half a year. because my laptop is a 2-in-1, so whenever my keyboard stops responding, i would just flip my screen over and flip it back, then it would temporarily bring back my keyboard to life. but it can start responding very soon after, this just keeps going back and forth. i have tried instructions advised by dell as well as advice from google, such as bios update, system reinstall, factory reset, device manager (keyboard driver reinstall), filter keys disabled, etc., but this problem still persists. sometimes, this keyboard can start to not respond very frequently after i flipped my screen back and over to bring it back to life, like it can happen again after a few seconds when i temporarily fixed it by flipping my screen; but sometimes the keyboard can work fine like a normal for a straight few days with no problem until it happens again next time. the link attached above has a similar guy in the comment section where he was also experiencing the same problem, and he had his keyboard replaced by dell\\'s technician and no luck. so i think it is not a keyboard\\'s physical problem, but rather some sort of corrupted built-in files, software, or some defected drivers. any ideas how to solve this problem? i would try them one by one. is there a better good looking, good screen, powerful windows laptop for business use? recently bought an xps 15 9520 (i7, 3050, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd) for business use (numerical simulations and some cad work). i bought an xps 13 back when they were first released. it was perfectly adequate, and it\\'s saying something that it\\'s still kicking today (although too slow for any serious work). the issues i had with the xps back then are pretty much the same issues i\\'m encountering now: keyboard feels gummy; machine gets hot; issues with the mousepad; also, i feel like the backlit keyboard is dimmer than i was expecting. so, are there any other windows laptops that could legitimately compete with the xps? one of the main selling points of this machine for me was the oled screen, although i\\'m not a fan of the touchscreen. thin bezels, good screen, and an aluminum chassis may be hard to beat. if yes, where is it? i looked all over in \"my dell\" and settings but couldn\\'t find it. my old dell inspiron laptop had an option in \"my dell\" to adjust fan speed. is there a similar option in xps 8950 ? hello, i\\'ve recently gotten a xps 15 9520 (i7-12700h, 3050ti, 32gb ram, oled) and from most mainstream reviews (with oled), the reported battery life is ~10-12 hours per charge. however i\\'m getting ~4-5 hours at most. i\\'m not sure what settings i should tweak to get 10 hours per charge - or is this a myth? i do use an external monitor, so maybe this is it? but i just have my screens set at 1080p thinking this may save me some juice between charging. thanks in advance for any advice! i\\'ve received an email from dell. the email reads about an issue with their xps 13 plus units\\' lcds \\'detaching\\' (a manufacturing error). i haven\\'t experienced this issue with mine (yet), however, they were happy to replace mine with a new one anyway. has anyone else received a similar email? if yes, where is it? i looked all over in \"my dell\" and settings but couldn\\'t find it. my dell inspiron laptop 3797 had an option in \"my dell\" to adjust fan speed. is there a similar option in xps 8950 ? hi all. i have a problem with my xps in which whenever i close the lid of my laptop, the battery always drains quickly. i have checked the power usage and it drains about 6% every hour. i have checked for every solution, including going to control panel power options where the boxes already said that closing the lid will make my laptop sleep. i have even tried to do a factory reset to no avail, and a hardware scan where everything is normal. any help would be appreciated. my video is finally up! hope you guys enjoy the content!! i forced an update today through windows installer, just out of curiousity. once installed, i\\'ve run another update check, installed some stuff through windows update, some drivers through intel driver & support assist but overall everything seems to be so far so good. i haven\\'t tried playing games yet, so can\\'t say anything about that. start menu seems more responsive as i\\'ve been playing around for 5-6 hours now. i haven\\'t noticed any bugs so far. i recently expanded my c drive backwards with the easeus partition master and after a reboot, it is now stuck at just the dell logo or a 25% full progress bar when entering the boot menu or bios setup. what can i do to fix this? pictures: https://imgur.com/a/ganxigp laptop model: dell xps 13 9310 i have a xps 13 9310 with 4k screem. bios and latest drivers updated. already disabled apps on startups that i dont use and those running in the background. switched from chrome to edge cause i read chrome kills battery life. brightness up less than 50%. it doesnt show the exact number. i also read somewhere to adjust \"maximum processor state\" under processor management to 50% so i did that.... so battery life is slightly better than before... but is it normal for it to say 2 hrs and 22 min left w 96% battery left? i am just browsing and its normal for me to have 15 to 20 tabs open. nothing else going on. at this point i am seriously considering changing to a macbook air because i heard they have superior battery power. is there anything i can do to fix this xps? i have a xps 15 9510 and it hasn’t even been a year i’m experiencing keyboard issues my k key stopped working and due to that my i,8,=,+ and comma stopped working has anyone experienced this issue and can anyone help me it hasn’t even been a year hello everyone, i hope all is well! i am seeking help to figure out why my touchpad or cursor is lagging on my dell xps 13 2 in 1. when i put my fingers on the touchpad and try to move the cursor is lags and it doesn’t move for the first 2 seconds and every time i take my hand off of it and try to move it again it does the same thing. has someone had to deal with this issue before? some guidance would be much appreciated! thank you in advance. i recently received my xps 9520 (i7 12700h, gtx 3050ti, 64g ram, 3.5k oled screen), i updated all my drivers with the dell assistant tool and official nvidia driver, and i plugged my 2 other dell 4k@60hz hdr screen to the wd22tb4 display ports video output. but when i play on valorant, all of my screen (even the screen of my xps) are flashing (complete black-out for seconds), the only solution i found is reducing the resolution of my screen at 1080p. do you have a solution ? i\\'ve installed nvidia-drivers-515 on ubuntu 20.04 (dualboot with win11 alongside) and about 70% of time when i reboot or turn on my laptop, i get following lines: usci_acpi usbc000:00 unknown error 0 usci_acpi usbc000:00 ucsi_get_pdos failed (-5) usci_acpi usbc000:00 ppm init failed (-110) \\u200b tried resetting bios settings, reinstalling nvidia drivers, autoinstalling them, nothing of those works here. is it even possible to fix this on this laptop? my xps 13 is turning itself on right after shut down. i have even pulled out the laptop from my backpack and it would be hot. even the screen is on and now i fear there is burn in on the oled screen. i have checked lid settings and set to shutdown after closing lid and still no luck. anyone having the same issue? after selecting the i7-1280p and ubuntu 22.04, the configuration site resets always back to i7-1260p . for i7-1280p only windows is possible. is this a website bug or dell policy or some kind of linux limitation? when i buy the i7-1280p only with windows pre-installed, is there any chance to have access to dell specific custom linux driver downloads (apt repo url)? \\u200b configuration site: https://www.dell.com/de-de/shop/dell-notebooks/xps-13-plus-laptop/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/cn93323cc my xps 13 is turning itself on right after shut down. i have even pulled out the laptop from my backpack and it would be hot. even the screen is on and now i fear there is burn in on the oled screen. i have checked lid settings and set to shutdown after closing lid and still no luck. anyone having the same issue?

due to my work i have to draw a lot of models, graphs & equations. i currently have a separat ipad pro for that, but it can be a bit irritating having to transfer the drawings between the devices. therefore i am looking for a good pen to use with the laptop. so if anyone has any recommendations that would be greatly appreciated. (also, is the xps 13 9315 equipped with a magnet like the pen compatible ones?) anyone else get this message in windows update on their xps 9710? the message points here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/known-issues/browse/?wt.mc_id=win11update&osversion=22621&terms=ref%3a41332279 \\u200b \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/3agcwq8c3np91.png?width=2064&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c6b7088c405d9fc68434f8fe7512269333b414d its an xps 9510. i have disabled turbo boost in bios, i have reduced maximum processor state, battery is set on \\'balanced\\' tho. i used \\'my dell\\' to set thermals to \\'quiet\\', that helps very well with heat and reduces noise, but my keyboard (surface of the laptop in general) gets very very warm. also it mentioned reduced performance in tuning on that option. one thing again, this extreme temperatures occur when i am plugged in alone. plugged in and basically doing nothing (no games, no chrome on, nothing). on battery the heat and noise is reduced, and manageable. the main thing i bought this pc for was to code, i havent even done much of that lately. please, this is my first flagship laptop, first xps. i didnt expect to have this type of trouble 😢 anyone know how to fix this problem in device manager? new xps 9710 with the nvidia 3050. i downloaded and installed the latest nvidia drivers and also tried the dell drivers too. i\\'ve already disabled memory security and upgraded to the latest dell bios. ok, so... i\\'ve got a new(er) xps 9720. and for some reason, especially when dealing with a large number of subfoldwrs, my windows explorer just seems to hang for several minutes when i change anything (this includes working with smaller subsets of folders within a large array of folders (for this specific complaint, i\\'m working with my audiobook collection which is about 1tb. i\\'m trying to organize all of my artists and their respective audiobooks, as well as getting rid of extras like their digital copies of the same book. anyway, hope someone can kick me in the right direction... to note: the rest of the system isn\\'t hanging (usually). i can use other applications, like chrome, while explorer hangs. specs; 9720 11th gen i9-11980hk 64gb ram 2 m2 drives (windows sits on 1x2tb samsung 980, i have ubuntu on second drive: 1x512gb samsung 980). windows 11 pro n. v21h2 (n version is stripped of the windows media player fluff) i don\\'t know why i\\'ve been using it for a year and can\\'t run 2 programs at one i just purchased the 9315 with i7 1260p, 16 gb, and 512 gb of storage. i was so excited for this as i had another xps for 3 years with no issues (until i spilled my coffee and ruined it). i just got it last night and it has already shut down twice while using it. my fan has run non stop with a moderately light workload. i have a few chrome browsers open and my notion workspace, yet everything is surprisingly slow. there is no reason to have spent almost $1600 on a laptop with this many issues. even after this latest windows 11 update, which was supposed to help, my 3-month-old xps 9520 is performing pathetically. it can’t handle chrome, excel, and zoom at the same time without getting extremely laggy. and once it becomes laggy, it doesn’t get better even when i close programs. it only improves briefly after restarting and then returns to poor performance again soon. i have it set to best performance. it’s got 32gb. idk what gives. this thing was supposed to be a powerhouse. i have dual boot installed on my system(windows+ubuntu). last night i tried to switch from windows to ubuntu, but the system would not boot. im not sure if windows tried to do an update during the reboot because i was away at that moment. now, ubuntu gives \"gave up waiting for root file system device error\". windows gives \"inaccesible boot device\" bsod. also, windows and ubuntu are installed to different ssds. i tried updating th bios and it did not help. anyone else had this issue? edit2: apparently windows works, but ubuntu still doesnt boot. not sure why. edit: i ran the os recovery tool in the boot configuration menu. the tool detected an issue with the boot files and \"repaired\" it. now it seems it to be working. just a few hours i observed my pc started running hot. above normal temp, while literally doing nothing on battery. usually it gets warm when plugged in, but now on battery and its running louder and hotter than when plugged in? and no, there were no background apps running. i also already disabled turbo boost in bios long ago. i restarted my pc a few times and the same thing. this just happened out of nowhere i have the xps 9510 configured as 11800h/3050ti/64gb/2tb+1tb samsung 980 pros, windows 11 22h2. for some reason i cannot make a 3090 work in an egpu (razer core x). a radeon vii connects perfectly, a few seconds appears in device manager and after a quick reboot, both davinci resolve and premiere made use of it. but the 3090 either gives me an instant bsod or device manager does not recognize it. any advice? anyone has make an nvidia egpu work? i suspect the nvidia driver is getting confused, so i disabled the 3050ti, and still no luck making the 3090 work. some photos here: https://imgur.com/a/5opuzv2 since windows went full tpm with bitlocker, i have not been able to successfully dual-boot ubuntu on my xps 15 9520 without bitlocker freaking out. has anyone had any success with this and if so does anyone have a solid updated guode i could follow? searched forums, and google and came up empty and i am just slamming my head off the wall with this. any ideas? hey guys, so i am seeing this weird issue with my xps 17 (9710) where it won’t turn on or show any signs of booting up. weirdly enough the caps lock key lits up when i press it but other than that there is no sign of life. wondering if anyone has any suggestions. tia just got this in today and only had a minute before had to head into work. coming from an adamo 13 so consider that regarding my comments. yes i realize that laptop is over 10 years old. and the 9315 is way slimmer and lighter. the 9315 felt plastic like and flimsy. was underwhelmed upon unboxing a $1k laptop. so what pieces are plastic, which are metal or composite ? specifically it was the lcd back cover case rear lid that seemed plastic. tia thinking of doing a clean install from usb, using the new 22h2 version. normally when i do this on machines i\\'ve built, i delete all the hard drive partitions and let windows rebuild whatever it needs from the clean install process. if i do this with my xps, though, that would mean nuking the dell version of the image, all the bundled dell apps, etc. i\\'d actually be fine with that if the essentials can be installed later (i.e. maybe mydell app). has anyone gone down this road yet, if not with 22h2 than some other version? hey gang, just received my 9710 refurb and had to install all the dell drivers from scratch. does anyone know what the correct touchpad drivers for win 11? i have the xps 9510 configured as 11800h/3050ti/64gb/2tb+1tb samsung 980 pros, windows 11 22h2. for some reason i cannot make a 3090 work in an egpu (razer core x). a radeon vii connects perfectly, a few seconds appears in device manager and after a quick reboot, both davinci resolve and premiere made use of it. but the 3090 either gives me an instant bsod or device manager does not recognize it. any advice? anyone has make an nvidia egpu work? i suspect the nvidia driver is getting confused, so i disabled the 3050ti, and still no luck making the 3090 work. some photos here: https://imgur.com/a/5opuzv2 in week three of ownership of an 8950 (i7, 32gb, 3060i, 750w) and it\\'s been a good experience. from the start, i noticed that the tidal pc app would disconnect during music playback about every 3-5 minutes, and remain in a disconnected state. my audio pipeline is 8950, yamaha/steinberg asio driver, usb out, usb in on yamaha dac/amp - home wifi network. this combo of audio hardware/software/network, and their settings, worked perfectly with my previous laptop since joining tidal last january. at first, i faulted the tidal pc app, as it actually disconnects, and throws an error \"chosen audio output has been disconnected\". nothing is disconnected as far as i can tell. i have been working with the tidal tech team to diagnose this problem - no fixes yet. but, over the past few weeks, i\\'ve tried other audio apps, such as foobar 2000, tidal web app, and tidal android app (running on win11) and while these apps don\\'t \"disconnect\", there is a noticeable audio dropout of about 1-2 seconds on the same cadence - about every 3-5 minutes. maybe these other apps \"handle\" the dropout better than the tidal pc app? they have a dropout, but then keep playing - the tidal pc app remains disconnected. this leads me to think that there\\'s something happening with the 8950 that is causing the audio disconnects/dropouts. so now i am looking into every setting that could cause a sleep or similar-type state in the 8950 usb ports, interfaces, everywhere. a quick look into online posts, and i see a history of 8950/8940 issues with audio, and people talking about the gpu drivers causing similar issues. first, i am going to exhaust all possible settings that could lead to an idle or sleep state, causing the disconnect. after that, i am up to whatever you folks suggest. maybe this has been resolved already? i really need to be able to listen to audio for more than just a few minutes without dropouts. i\\'ve been able to do this for decades, on far less capable/expensive hardware. if i can\\'t make this happen, i\\'ll be returning this machine. tia for any help you can provide! so work issued me a 9320 and i really really dislike it. it seems to have a lot of software issues, the function keys are touchscreens which drives me insane, it gets scorching hot just opening edge, and it runs on battery for maybe 3 hours. work is willing to exchange it for a precision 5470. i know the function key issue will be solved, but for anyone who has used both - will this help with any of my other problem areas? i have ssd samsung 980 pro i pressed the power button, i timed and it took around 30 sec to access the windows lock screen i turned on fastboot in bios (auto), fast startup, and some apps startup in windows turn it on. hi everyone, i was wondering if there is a fix to the bass on the xps 13 9305 not working, the moment i turn it on in maxxaudiopro all the sound us gone, and before it started not working, it had a weird sound with the bass. can the no sound with bass be fixed, or do i need to contact dell? hi! i\\'m currently traveling and this is a bad timing for my xps to start acting weird. i opened it up this morning and some issues started to occur: some applications like winrar take about 15-20 seconds to open some apps like google chrome or skype or zoom dont open at all (i click on the icon and nothing happens) no external devices (harddisks on any port with different cables) or sd cards are connected: no sound, nothing under \"my computer\". turning it on and off sometimes also takes forever - but no clear pattern there yet. i turned it off completely, disconnected it from power and so on. the only thing i did was installing zoom this morning, which also did not open the app for the meeting - not sure of this has anything to do with it, but that was the first time i noticed it. i uninstalled it again. i really dont know where to start to look: the last updates via dell update manager were installed 2 weeks ago, and also windows did not install any major updates according to the update history. i have win 11 pro, bios 1.4.0 and the 2 tb ssd version with nvidia 3050 ti i am using no thrid party anti virus or firewall - only windows defender i\\'m only finding skins available for the 9310 and have been told it doesn\\'t fit. any luck? view poll hi, for some reason, my xps isn\\'t connecting to my external monitor. i\\'m trying to connect it using a usb hub into an hdmi cable, which should work, but when i press \"detect other display\" in settings it doesn\\'t work. \\u200b it likely isn\\'t an issue with the monitor as it\\'s brand new. i\\'ve tried projecting, restarting and updating drivers but none of them worked. very frustrating. interestingly, when it\\'s connected, it doesn\\'t seem like there\\'s \"no signal\", as my monitor would have a graphic telling me if nothing is connected, but it just goes black when i try to connect the laptop to it. please let me know if you have any ideas. thanks! install using dell update application the xps 8950 setup and specifications says memory configurations supported 8 gb, 1 x 8 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz 16 gb, 2 x 8 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4800 mhz 16 gb, 1 x 16 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz 32 gb, 2 x 16 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4800 mhz 64 gb, 4 x 16 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4000 mhz 64 gb, 2 x 32 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4800 mhz 128 gb, 4 x 32 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 3600 mh i have 16 gb with one slot (dimm1) of 4 filled. the stick says 16gb 1rx8 pc5-4608b-ua9-1010-xt any insight as to what adding another similar stick into another slot would do, other than giving me 32 gb? i am thinking of interleaving etc. slot dimm1 has white pull-tabs, as does slot dimm2. would i assume that the second stick would go into slot dimm2? i am not experiencing slowness. but still, easy upgrading at some point is something i would do. i doubt this that xps-specific, but would apply to other dell computers that use the z690 chipset. asking those who have previously replaced xps batteries or know how similar or different the types of xpss are. i\\'m a new xps 13 owner, and it looks like i am going to have to prepare to replace the battery in my xps 13 9315 after a few years of use as to avoid swelling and damaging the chassis. i can only find batteries that specify their compatibility with xps 9300s on the internet, however. it would seem to me that a battery that fits one xps 13 should hypothetically be applicable to all computers of a similar size, mine is just under a unique model name because of minute customizations i made to it. here\\'s a specific example i\\'m looking at: ifixit dell xps 13 9300 battery should i be worried about it? i have a dell xps 13 plus, and this thing gets hot. i updated all the firmware and software, and, unfortunately, it hasn\\'t helped. i then downloaded dell optimizer, but there is no area there to control the fans. can anything else be done? i love almost everything about this laptop, but it\\'s just too hot. i might have to return it if i can\\'t figure this out. hi, i am trying to utilize the gpu when connecting to external displays, but it appears not working for me. maybe i am missing something, but i have tried multiple times and keep getting the same issue. after going into the bios and enabling discrete graphics controller direct output mode, nothing displays on the external displays. i believe that the 9720 with nvidia 3060 is supposed to support this. the interesting thing is that the nvidia control panel recognizes the external display and which port is used, but nothing is displayed. also another strange thing that i noticed was that restarting the computer takes forever to restart. i waited up to 10 minutes, and it didn\\'t restart. i had to hold the power button to do it after that. any suggestion regarding this issue? am i the only one having this? \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/5nj5ersurpo91.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e09d25f75f853f3b69604b5b89c20941481fdfcb https://preview.redd.it/wcbfkqsurpo91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcd2e0ffaadd0bb74d0906633fa307683c4342c7 \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/eiry1z4sxpo91.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f2b06dadcb6391330e09ea8015998be1ca7380d hi all - i\\'ve been a dell laptop user for years -- from an xps 15 9530, to an xps 15 9560, and now an xps 17 9720. the 17 is excellent -- except i learned that on waking up from sleep, the laptop no longer sees the realtek usb gbe family controller (not even in device manager, and not even if i show hidden devices or scan for changes). when it\\'s in that state i can only connect to the network via wi-fi. a lot of googling yielded results that show people suffering from this issue for more than 10 years. turns out that it\\'s the classic issue of windows turning off the device to save power. this puts the device into \"deep sleep\" where it\\'s not even detected by windows anymore -- and it happens most frequently when you allow windows to go into sleep mode. seems that the quick fix (once the device is out of sleep again) is to: 1) go into device manager / network adapters 2) double click / open the entry for the realtek ethernet controller (whatever yours may be called) 3) go to the power management tab and uncheck the option to \"allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\". 4) click ok, and then close device manager. oddly, some devices know how to wake up properly as soon as power is present. for ex: intel / killer wi-fi adapters have no problem and wake up instantly after sleep. same with wan miniport, bluetooth radios, etc. i find it pretty weird that people have been dealing with this issue with realtek ethernet adapters for more than a decade, but computers are still being distributed with that power management setting by default allowing these devices to go into deep sleep and becoming unusable. oh well. at least this fix seems promising. i was watching a movie with my xps 9310 on my legs when the video froze and the audio went into a loop and got louder. i shut down the computer and now it\\'s not starting. it was hot but not extremely. now it just shows the dell logo on screen and flash 4 times the white led and 2 times the yellow one. it should signal ram failure. it was running ubuntu, recently updated to 22.04. i had this laptop for less than a year and i would like to know if someone had the same problem. my 9320 had the bios 7.0 issues where it would stay on after being shut down and stay on when closed. twice it got extremely hot while in it\\'s sleeve, one time to the point that i could not take it out because it burned. dell support downgraded my bios and it has fixed that issue, but now my trackpad got stuck one day, i believe it is because of the extreme heat from that one time. they told me the trackpad and motherboard will be changed at an in-home technician service, but i wonder if they will change the entire palm rest. the xps plus has the weird hidden trackpad. has anyone else had this issue? comments and questions: i bought an xps 8950 with i7-12700k and integrated graphics. while i bought it with a mechanical hard drive, it was my intention to install a samsung pro nvme drive. as others have found, i had to change the bios away from raid to nvme. after that, the machine would not access the hard drive, but did make the nvme accessable. i am not sure what i will do with the hard drive. right now i was thinking it would be good if i every needed service to boot to that for dell troubleshooting. questions: i have bios version 1.5.0. is that the newest? what drivers would you suggest i get from the dell site. right now the drivers are those that came off of microsoft windows 11 installation process. i have no problem right now other than not being able to access the mechanical hard drive. i am also uncomfortable with windows 11 so far. i was not too comfortable with win10, and i am so far mostly on my w7 machine, as i am now. but maybe i should bite the bullet, and try to work with the w11 way of doing things for the most part. i find navigation hard, and using the find icon is the way i know how to navigate programs. then once i find the thing i want, i pin it to the task bar. i find the start icon useless other than for the reboot and shutdown icons. some day i might figure out how to put what i want on that rather than the bloatware/crapware links to amazon, spotify and a bunch of others. a clean install is not all that clean imo. i have been looking for a slim clam shell type case for my 9310. i tried the mcover one, it is terrible and requires modding to clear all vented areas of the laptop. also have been looking for maybe a silicone jacket type case. doesnt seem to be many options like with the mbp i have had in the past. any hints? hello. i have a problem when playing audio with a bluetooth headset. i connect it to the computer and play sound without any problem but after some time (it is random) it starts to stutter and goes worse. i temporaly solution is turn off the bluetooth and turn on again, it solves the problem for some time and it starts to have stutter again. someone with the same problem or similar problem found a solution? i\\'m currently very happy with my xps 13 9370 (i5, 8gb if ram) but after almost 5 years, its gotten a bit slow for the work i do. i\\'m a translator/interpreter, so i need to have multiple programs open for research and translating, word, excel, chrome, zoom, etc., but nothing like processing multimedia or gaming. the 9370 lags sometimes. i\\'ll probably get the xps 13 plus, non-touch, 16gb. but i\\'m not sure if the i7 would be worth it or even wise to get over the i5. my priorities are: stability/reliability working with multiple windows opened at once on an external monitors and a lot of peripherals like a mic, webcam, ethernet (this is super important for remote interpretation), hdmi, etc. i use a dock, so i don\\'t care about the lack of ports. nothing i use is too demanding but i need them all to be stable always. it has to last at least 5 years, preferably more. my current xps is still in great shape, just a bit slow. battery life. in terms of hours but also in years. although i can always get a new one, i\\'d like it to last as much as possible. i read years ago that the i7 processor ran too hot in such a small laptop, and that it could affect its longevity, which i want to avoid. thank you for reading. i did a clean windows 11 install, but i also then installed and ran dell supportassist. it identified two drivers to update. would i expect that to check my bios version in addition to drivers? xps 8950 with i7-12700k and integrated graphics. came with win11 professional. i have bios version 1.5.0. is that the newest? the dell website thing that offers a download to check bios has an os selection box, and windows 10 is the only choice. anyone tried updating to it yet? fixes & enhancements - fixed the issue where the system wakes up through the dell hd22 dock when the wake on lan option is disabled in the bios setup. - fixed the issue where the admin password window is displayed when you run the pre-boot system assessment (epsa) in the bios setup. - fixed the issue where the system stops responding at the dell logo while booting. - fixed the issue where updating bios is interrupted when you press ctrl+alt+delete. - fixed the issue where the system does not wake up when you turn on the external monitor with the dell power button sync feature. per the title, i have a dell xps 15 9510 with the i9-11900h processor. it definitely gets hot (bounces off of 100c) on battery under a decent load. likewise, it impacts battery life. in power settings, for max processor state, if i change it to 99% i know it turns off turbo boost. i have already seen that temps drop significantly. however, will this also increase battery life. obviously, i can try to test myself but i figured i\\'d ask to see if i can get an answer quicker:) i\\'m thinking about buying a dell xps 15 9520. however, i\\'ve heard that previous iterations have had issues with overheating, is this still the case with the current model? for background i need a laptop for general work purposes, writing, for hobbyist photo editing (and some video editing), and some casual gaming (if it can run crusader kings 3 smoothly i\\'m happy!). thanks i just ordered the 9315 i5+16gb+512gb with an anti reflective display. i was really confused between this and the i7 oled xps13 plus but after careful thought, the aud$700 difference was too big a difference for me. i let go of the supposedly better speakers, and definitely better display and design for a more functional and practical option. is the downgrade really that evident or is the 9315 still a great laptop by itself? the most i will use the laptop for is uni work, browsing, media streaming, and some light ms office work. i hear wildly different things from all over the internet and for some weird reasons, there are hardly any good reviews available to watch online. is the laptop actually good if we don\\'t look at all the technical stuff? will the battery disappoint? is the display good? how are the speakers on it? i am going to college next month and would be looking to buy one of the above from the us and get it to india, the price difference is vast in all of them and would be much cheaper for me. gpu isn\\'t necessary but i would love to have one (nvidia preferred for rendering) here is the issue- i want to use it for 4-5 years, won\\'t game but heavy use for sure (photoshop, video editing, lightroom, blender(not sure maybe), android studio) and coding too. i have seen people complaining a lot about issues (poor thermals, battery life, quality control issues, speakers popping, screen detaching etc etc) in the 13 plus and i got scared, and not really comfortable now, can you tell me how is it right now?xps 15 with 3050 is a good option but a bit expensive than the others. x14 is the god tier for me then but again i am not sure if anyone is experiencing any issues. i need opinions from you guys for the same i prefer x14 over zephyrus g14/g15, correct me if i am wrong lenovo 7i pro x is also good but the thermals aren\\'t good enough, india is very hot anyways so doesn\\'t look like the best option or should i go for macbook would like to add some protection. - is there a recommended cover that works well? i looked at the mcover, but they only have it available for 9310 so far. any other options? - how about privacy cover for camera? didn\\'t realize how narrow the width is at the top. any options recommended? the xps 8950 setup and specifications says memory configurations supported 8 gb, 1 x 8 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz 16 gb, 2 x 8 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4800 mhz 16 gb, 1 x 16 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz 32 gb, 2 x 16 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4800 mhz 64 gb, 4 x 16 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4000 mhz 64 gb, 2 x 32 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 4800 mhz 128 gb, 4 x 32 gb, dual-channel ddr5, 3600 mh i have 16 gb with one slot (dimm1) of 4 filled. the stick says 16gb 1rx8 pc5-4608b-ua9-1010-xt any insight as to what adding another similar stick into another slot would do, other than giving me 32 gb? i am thinking of interleaving etc. slot dimm1 has white pull-tabs, as does slot dimm2. would i assume that the second stick would go into slot dimm2? i wrote a while back about borking my 9520. all is good now. i called support and with their guidance, i waited out the boot sequence was able to start up the laptop. the laptop ran ok, but was still running hot. i re-pasted with thermal grizzly kryonaught extreme and now the laptop is running much cooler, and i don\\'t hear the fan as much. i think all is fine now. at least i don\\'t have an extremely expensive paperweight. thanks everyone for your support! i\\'m a tinkerer so i like fixing stuff if i can. i\\'m seeing a lot of complaints about qc issues but i\\'m still interested in getting a second hand xps to tinker with if the issues don\\'t concern the mobo/cpu and if the price is right. if you\\'re like me, let me know how you have solved these issues (diy?). if i can get an xps 9510/9710/9520/9720, i\\'d be very happy. i\\'ve never owned a laptop but i\\'ve used it at work. i\\'d like to find a laptop with cosmetic qc/non qc issues for a good bargain and diy fix them. hello everyone! i recently bought the 9720 model with 4k, 12700h and 3060. so far i love it but i have only one concern. when i play games the battery drained a little bit (1h of playing, it went from 100% to 95% of battery) even if it was plugged. there is a way for preventing doing this, maybe some bios settings? thank you in advance! hey this is regarding the dell xps 15 9520 that i received yesterday, so i downgraded from windows 11 to windows 10 today with some help from you guys and i installed all the drivers, but when i listen to the speakers they are very quiet. i installed the proper drivers from the dell website. i\\'m confused and i need help. hi all, i haven\\'t seen test results for this model yet. could you please help me to choose between it and ms surface pro 8 (or upcoming sp9) for this criterion? thanks! hello all, so recently i have had to travel for a few weeks away from my home office. this has forced me to consider buying an editing laptop, having previously worked on a desktop pc i built in 2018. \\u200b this is my previous build: os: windows 11 cpu: ryzen threadripper 2950x gpu: geforce rtx 2080 ti ram: 64 gb new setup: dell xps 15 9520 os: windows 11 cpu: 12th gen intel(r) core(tm) i9-12900hk gpu: geforce rtx 3050 ti ram: 64 gb \\u200b i thought that both computers would be pretty comparable in terms of performance. i wasn\\'t really needing an upgrade, but rather to have a continuation of my desktop performance but in a mobile system. so far, i have been working on editing a simple music video i shot. i ran into weird glitches and bugs on my first attempt with multi-cam sequencing in premiere pro. i gave up on the multi-cam sequence and manually sequenced all video tracks on multiple tracks on my main timeline. i shot this particular video on prores raw 4k, but my timeline is in 1080p. i\\'ve never had an issue with prores raw on my previous setup. as soon as i playback on the new setup, premiere throws an error event telling me my gpu is not powerful enough to decode the raw footage. i have proxies made and attached, but it struggles and skips more than 100 frames on playback even with those. i have a few red giant plugins on this timeline (universe and colorista v), and it\\'s making it hell to work with. multiple freezes, which require a complete restart to get past. long story short, this editing project is taking three times as long as i have to troubleshoot and find workarounds for a lot of things on top of dealing with premiere issues and bugs i\\'ve never seen before. i wouldn\\'t say my prior build is that cutting edge anymore, and i also wouldn\\'t call this project hyper-demanding. it really seems to be an issue with the prores raw codec, but i cannot be sure. i have another very heavily edited project i\\'m working on for a client that has all sorts of codecs and footage from different cameras, but that project seems to load fine. since my shooting workflow involves mostly shooting in raw codec, i\\'m not sure this will continue to work for me. i planned to sell my desktop piecemeal eventually and then buy a tb 4 dock, have a dual monitor setup, and potentially buy a tb 3 egpu and a 4080ti to get over my gpu issues which seems to be the bottleneck in this system. i don\\'t usually work off laptops, so i\\'ve had to do more research on egpu\\'s. a lot of information on the internet tells me they are pretty much pointless. i\\'m not sure i could get over this raw codec bottleneck issue with it. besides my experience with this music video project, the computer is quite fast. i\\'m sure this cpu is faster than my prior threadripper. \\u200b sorry that this has turned into quite the ramble. i just wanted to provide as much context as possible. so i\\'m stuck with a few decisions and would like input from other pros. return my laptop within the 30 days mark. learn different workflows to get around this prores raw bottleneck or any other issues that may be causing these problems (optimizing and overclocking the xps?) buy an egpu with a top-of-the-line gpu to get over this bottleneck. i\\'d rather not give up entirely on the laptop as it seems like a better long-term setup, a docking station with egpu at home to work fast and a suitably fast laptop to work off of on the field with workflow modifications. however, i\\'m not sure that is still possible and am slightly disheartened with my decision. any help is appreciated. thanks. hey y’all! i got my brand new dell xps 8950 last week and she’s fantastic.. while downloading forza 5 this week onto my c:/ drive, it started making a sight noise that sounds like distant fireworks popping… i’ve contacted dell tech support and was running diagnostics and checking firm ware for 3 hours. everything comes back clean.. has anyone else experienced this noise and should i be concerned? the internals seem almost the same, the biggest difference seems to be the 2-in-1 vs non 2-in-1. if cost isn’t an issue, would it just be better to get the new 2-in-1 instead of the new xps 9135? hi there, does anyone know if the 9510 motherboard could work in a 9500 chasis? i’m about to replace it, and i’ve seen that some parts of both models are compatible, and since the price of both motherboards is almost the same i was wondering if it could work. thanks i have a new xps159520 and the main problem i\\'m having is that when opening a folder containing video files, they slowly load one by one and it takes quite a long time. i\\'ve never had this issue before even on my previous cheap asus laptop that isn\\'t nearly as powerful as this one. any ideas? thanks. i just noticed a new bios update came out a few days ago for the xps 8950, does anyone know exactly what\\'s new in this version and does it actually improve something in particular? has anyone had any problems with it? this is the description on the dell website, says it may include \"other new features\" the update contains changes to maintain overall system health. it ensures that the system software remains current and compatible with other system modules (firmware, bios, drivers, and software) and may include other new features. hey, so i just got my 9520 in the mail, and when i\\'m trying to do a clean install of windows 10 on it, it throws the error saying that there is no storage driver, and when i tried to give it one, it said there was no drivers available? i\\'m sitting here and scratching my head, because this is a new error. any help is welcome! the bios edit method - https://brendangreenley.com/undervolting-2020-dell-laptops-like-the-vostro-7500-and-more-tips-to-improve-thermals-battery-life-and-speed/ or does the bios edit method work exclusively on the xps 9520 i9? does saving to bios using the edit method also work (either on the i7 or i9)? like here - https://www.reddit.com/r/xps/comments/sh02yr/undervolting_my_9510_11800h_with_windows_11_and/ hi there, does anyone know if the 9510 motherboard could be installed in a 9500 chasis? i’m about to replace it, and i’ve seen that some parts of both models are compatible, and since the price of both motherboards is almost the same i was wondering if it could work. thanks i bought the xps 13 plus 3920 certified refurbished, and it said it complies with iso standards. the first day i opened the laptop while doing all the microsoft settings, it got pretty warm, and i am afraid it already has a hardware problem, maybe something with the fans cause even when it\\'s extremely hot it\\'s dead silent i don\\'t know if that\\'s normal. does anyone know if i should really be concerned or if it\\'s normal and the model is just ordinarily warm and the fans are completely silent? i recently purchased the dell xps 9520 core i9 32 gb ram & 1 tb ssd. i purchased 2 samsung 1 tb 980 pro and installed them then created raid 0 volume . the problem after injecting the vmd driver and installing windows it doesn’t boot up status 0xc0000225 error the boot configuration data for your pc is missing or contains error so any suggestions or support would be appreciated i just received my new dell xps 13 plus laptop, and i have to say, i\\'m impressed. the screen is gorgeous (oled upgrade). the keyboard is the best keyboard i\\'ve ever used, and i love the new design. the lack of a mouse outline not only works just fine, but it\\'s really clean and crisp. i also think they did a really good job with the display lighting above the numbers on the keyboard for the \"esc\" and \"volume\" keys, etc. everything feels really sturdy, well built, and elegant. in fact, it\\'s the first time i can say that about a pc as someone who regularly uses macbooks. my only complaint is the heat when using it on my lap. i also have macbook air m2, and that machine never gets warm sitting on my lap (nor does it have a fan). however, this dell laptop definitely does get noticeably warm when sitting with it on my lap. it\\'s not terrible, but it does making working with it a little less comfortable than my macbook. but other than that, i\\'m really impressed. considering on getting the anker 747 charger ganprime 150w as an all purpose charger. has anyone tried using the new anker ganprime changers to see if they can keep up with dell xps 17? has anyone had the opportunity to try the new 2-in-1 folio? i\\'m interested in it as a potential replacement for my surface pro 6, but the folio-style keyboard looks like it may be difficult or impossible to use on anything other than a flat surface. i\\'m not sure if it\\'s even shipping yet, but has anyone had the ability to test lapability yet? does anybody notice the trackpad on the 9320 developer edition (ubuntu 22.04) will randomly feel \"floaty\"? like it will be working perfectly and very accurate, and then suddenly it will start feeling super inconsistent with the cursor not going exactly where i want it to. almost like if this were windows, the precision driver is no longer working. i haven\\'t been able to find anything online about this issue, so it could be a hardware issue on my end. hello all, i have xps 13 9315, i7, 16gb ram, 500gb ssd fullhd display . its brand new laptop and my battery lasts around 4-5 hours just browsing web (having multiple tabs open) and being on my email. i contacted dell support, they checked the usage and said everything is normal and that i should have purchase i5 to get better battery life. is it really normal to not get full day from new ass laptop? my 6 year old ultrabook lasts 3 hours, and that battery is swollen and breaking the case. i have a dell xps 15 9520 with a 500gb hard drive. i want to upgrade to at least a 1tb drive. dell\\'s 1tb drive cost upwards of $300 (and are sold out). while a drive from samsung costs just north of $125. both have a form factor of m.2 2280, though i admit i have no idea what that means.. why are the dell hard drives so much more expensive? and is there a risk to putting a samsung drive into a dell instead? \\u200b samsung: https://www.amazon.com/samsung-pcie-internal-gaming-mz-v8p1t0b/dp/b08glx7tnt/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?gclid=cj0kcqjw94wzbhdtarisakxwg--3pyvjjg833uf8bn_esz0nzxj39hwkjhpz3emsohhimx7uyi7gopiaaid4ealw_wcb&hvadid=240063485730&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9002242&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=6849675783139232592&hvtargid=kwd-315427074941&hydadcr=18004_9842080&keywords=samsung+ssd+1tb&qid=1663164251&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spla=zw5jcnlwdgvkuxvhbglmawvypueyv0plszfrougxukdfjmvuy3j5chrlzelkpuexmdeyodi2mlrvm09bruc5ujlqoczlbmnyexb0zwrbzelkpuewnzk1njc2mkflm0jyqu1pnfzpwcz3awrnzxroyw1lpxnwx2f0zizhy3rpb249y2xpy2tszwrpcmvjdczkb05vdexvz0nsawnrpxrydwu= dell: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-m2-pcie-nvme-gen-3x4-class-40-2280-solid-state-drive-1tb/apd/aa615520/storage-drives-media#techspecs_section hello, i just bought an xps 15 9520 and was wondering if i could reasonably use the built in hub for my monitor. i want to only have one cable plugged into the laptop and my usb-c port on my monitor also provides 100w power delivery. will being 30w lower than the oem charger hurt my battery. i am assuming it will but thought i\\'d ask. thanks all! xps chassis can\\'t cool itself under heavy prolonged load. you will need a good cooling pad so that the laptop will not melt. will have to reduce settings to low-medium graphics. if you don\\'t expect 4k 120hz, those should play fine. have been waiting for a new xps desktop, thanks for posting. 👍 are they the same 4k screens between the 9710 and 9720? did they ever fix the over saturation problem? i\\'ve had this new laptop (xps 17 9720, i9 processor, nvidia rtx 3060, 4k screen) for a couple of weeks now. on day one i uninstalled all of dell\\'s bloatware except for the driver updater. the privacy agreement for dell supportassist seemed particularly diabolical. a week or two later, i\\'m noticing that my fans are a little loud and whiny. i don\\'t think it\\'s coil whine, i only notice it when i\\'m running a graphics-intensive program and the fans start spinning up. probably normal, but i\\'m worried that i accidentally uninstalled some dell program that was regulating fans and temperature in some proprietary and necessary way. as far as i can tell, the only programs from dell that would potentially affect fan behavior / temperature control are \"my dell\" and \"dell fusion service.\" i\\'d rather not have these bloatware programs installed if i can help it, but it\\'s not worth frying my cpu/gpu over it. are my fans and components okay without them, or do i need to reinstall these two programs? hello all. i\\'m having trouble with my brand new xps15 9520. yesterday i updated the bios and now i cannot charge the device at full speed, it informs me that i\\'m using a non original charger, although i am using the original dell charger, which came in the box. checked dell updates for any new bios updates. there is one available but cannot apply them without \"using the original charger\" (which i am). cannot restore the system because no restore points were made by windows 11 before the bios update (which is annoying). can anyone help?? did anyone experience the same issue? last resort i have is to reset to factory, which i\\'m not supper excited to do... thank you so much!!! hello my friends of reddit, i\\'m about to order new dell xps 9520 (the one with 12th gen intel i9), but i\\'ve seen some rumors about the new 13th gen i9 (https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/13/23350509/intel-13th-gen-core-i5-i7-i9-specs-leak). i\\'m trying to decide if it is better to wait till like next year for the new xps with 13th intel i9 or what do you guys think? i\\'ve got an xps 9720, i-9 processor runs hot and makes noise. i love the rest, and the build quality is good too. i googled the possible solutions. and i see the below settings are really helpful. have a try if you also have the same concern. open the mydell app and select the power menu https://preview.redd.it/jlfedlge8mn91.jpg?width=1109&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67fd336c4cafb67287bd5e35e159dac0f50148b1 enter setting and find thermal as shown below. and switch to the quiet mode. so far, i don\\'t see much performance drop. https://preview.redd.it/302rh7cf8mn91.jpg?width=1158&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a49f65f8e4ce87225715e7876713bb404005c5e my new xps 15 9520 (arctic white) came in today, and i\\'ve almost immediately noticed that there were very noticeable stains on the edges of the white exterior plastic molding. i tried wiping them off with damp cloth but that\\'s the cleanest i was able to get them. there\\'s also a pretty big gap between the bottom aluminum cover and the plastic molding where the charge indicator led is. tightening the screws underneath it didn\\'t seem to help. are these within the expected range of imperfections? or did dell send me a faulty/refurbished system? should i contact dell for a replacement? i just received the xps 9315. all the latest updates installed and deleted most of the bloat like mcafee. i\\'ve noticed that when doing fairly like tasks like browsing the internet or word processing the fan turns on and the laptop gets hot. i don\\'t know if this is normal and i\\'m just wondering if other people with the same laptop experience the same thing or if its my unit. i have set the fan to quite mode in my dell. any help is appreciated. what is the max ssd i can upgrade to? i’ve seen 2tb and ive seen 4tb. hello, my technical knowledge is very limited. i wanted to do a fresh install of windows 11. it came with lot of bloatware like alexa and stuff and i read online that doing a fresh install of windows will speed up things. how do i do a fresh install? i’ve noticed when i put my laptop into my bag after hitting shutdown, when i take it out later it’s very hot. i noticed that about 30 seconds after shutting down it turns back on. is there any way to fix this? like a powerpoint. so i\\'m considering the dell xps 17 9720 (top spec) and things like 60hz panel (not a big deal for me) and weaker gpu (rtx 3060) are kind of keeping me back from buying it, and overall i\\'ve heard that the next generation of xps 17 is gonna get fully redesigned with newer chips. the reasons i\\'m considering the xps 17 instead of the blade 15 is because i like the bigger brighter and no bezel 16:10 display and the battery life on the blade is abysmal. altough the next gen blade might fix all of those issues as well and get fully redesigned. so is it worth pulling the trigger on any of these? is it worth waiting that much for the next gens? i\\'m an ai student and develop mobile games. i also play assetto corsa and gta 4 sometimes previously owned a razer blade 15 2070s hi there, i cannot turn off the computer, it turns right back on and sits idle in the windows 11 login screen. this is bad, the laptop sleeve was piping hot when i just pulled the machine out. i have a dell xps 15 9520, with a 130w usb-c charger, however if i try to charge my smartphone, powerbank or headphones, they do not charge, and the led on the charger socket starts blinking white. not uneven keys but warped lid, yes. xps 9500. still have it but it\\'s my last dell laptop, that\\'s for sure. hi, my xps 9320 ac adapter\\'s led blinks about 6 times when i plug it in and then turns off. can anyone confirm if this is normal or there is an issue with the led? thanks. admittedly, i have never tried since i purchased this laptop over a year ago. does the touchpad only have \"tap\" function for left and right click, or is there supposed to be a physical option to push...i.e. in the top or bottom left and right corners? i\\'ve only ever \"tapped\" but i just replaced the battery yesterday and noticed that the corners of my touchpad have 0 play if there is a physical \"button\" in the corners for left and right click. i may just have never noticed and the touchpad only accepts \"tapping\" i will be most likely buying this laptop. it will be the non touch one and 1920x1200 resolution. i notice this laptop as expensive it is, there are only 3 ports? \\u200b ports1 usb 3.2 gen 2 type-c™ (with displayport and powerdelivery) 2 thunderbolt™ 4 (usb type-c™) with displayport and powerdelivery 1 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo jack \\u200b 1. i read there is 0 usb a ports. at first i didn\\'t even know what usb a port is but when i read about it, i always just called it a usb port. so how would i even connect my wireless mouse, wired keyboard or port hub to it? it does say it comes with a usb-c to usb a dongle? so how exactly does that work? you connect that dongle to the only usb type c port there is or something? how many usb a ports can you connect to it then? so you could only connect 1 only? so you have to have a port hub then correct to connect more usb a devices like wired keyboard, wireless mouse, usb flash drive? \\u200b 2. i would be connecting 2 external monitors to it. one would be a 32\\' 4k samsung monitor where i previously used a usb-c to displayport cable to it. the other monitor is a 24\\' 1920x1200 asus monitor that i connected using a hdmi to dvi cable to it. that asus monitor also has vga and display port as well. so with the same cables i have, could i connect it to these 2 external monitors or not? would i need to buy an hdmi adapter? would i need a docking station? i assume no issue connecting a usb-c to displayport cable to the 32\\' 4k samsung monitor right? but i cannot connect the 24\\' asus monitor without some sort of adapter? could i actually connect a second 4k monitor somehow and if so, it would have to be usb-c from the laptop right? also how many total external monitors could i connect my laptop to without buying any adapter or dock station?

every laptop i ever used is like a barrel type of charging. hi, my xps 9320 ac adapter\\'s led blinks about 6 times when i plug it in and then turns off. can anyone confirm if this is normal or there is an issue with the led? thanks. hi everyone, i have an xps 15 9510 - 86 wh version. when i first received the laptop, the battery life was acceptable. it wasn\\'t great though; it would last around 6 hours. i mainly use my laptop to stream videos and web browsing. recently, i have only been getting 4 hrs. idk what happened to decrease my battery life by 30%. battery heath is good according to dell power manager. any ideas?

not that i\\'m facing any performance hiccups or anything, just curious. i just dont seem to see the way to do it (like on my inspiron with windows 10 how u could set \"plugged in - maximum performance, unplugged - best battery life or balanced etc.) the reason for this question is that i plan to play a few games on the system especially when i am bored. obviously the xps lineup isnt a gaming laptop for sure. but it can run a decent amount of games fairly well. the games i plan to run include (fifa22 in particular, then the heavier god of war and mortal kombat x mainly. plus gta just for cruise.) im not that much of a gamer though. battery life tips. this is the classic \"should i unplug it once its 100%?\" \"would running these games have like a kind of damage on the battery life?\" and just if u have any good battery life tips for your boy. any help would be appreciated! :) i love my 9720, no issues so far. only thing i did was shift it to ahci mode so i could use vendor ssd utility programs like samsung magician any tips or tricks on how to get the most out of it? i unfortunately have a ram problem (2 amber flashes followed by 4 white flashes) on my xps 13 9305. first instance, i opened up the back, disconnected the battery and held the power button for several seconds and then the system booted back up. after working for a few hours i had some more bsods and now it won\\'t boot with the same flashing sequence. i no longer have a warranty on the system and i am aware that the ram is soldered on to the motherboard on these xps 13. just wondering how to go about fixing the problem and how much a motherboard replacement might cost. i\\'m based in the uk. thanks in advance. i have a dell xps 13 9310 that i need to connect to an external hdmi monitor and a usb mouse/keyboard. right now i\\'m using a vava usb-c docking station that kind of sucks; i can\\'t pass power through to the laptop and keyboard/mouse input gets janky a lot of the time. i want to get a new docking station or usb hub that ideally lets me pass power through to the xps laptop or at least lets me use the hdmi monitor and external usb keyboard without significant delays or lag. budget tops up at $200. any recommendations? i purchased dell xps 9710 (i7 11th gen) model. it does not turn on like my other dell laptops by pressing the power button once. it needs me to press it for 3-4 seconds, however, when it is plugged in, it turns on with a single press. is this caused due to the s5 mode power consumption saving design from dell or microsoft?

or, how can the heat be regulated and the fan noise be less? i\\'ve had the laptop for less than 2 days and this heating thing when plugged in is bugging me. also, i do not have this issue when the laptop isnt plugged it. help please. hi, just wondering if anyone has seen this one.. i have monitors plugged in and every now and again the screen will flick to black and back again for a second or two.. suuuper irritating. drivers are up to date, bios is up to date. passes the online \\'test\\' @ dell.com/support with flying colours... ??? walked away from my laptop with my headphones in and pulled it off the table. the screen has a pretty noticeable gash. i’ve looked into self-repairs but i’m not experienced in any work like this. would a self-repair be easy? if so, where do i buy a replacement screen? edit: 9305^ my bad i found a pretty good deal on bestbuy with i9 + 32gb ram + 3050ti for 2399$. i am so attracted by the sleek design of xps15. since i am a heavy windows user and doing casual gaming (leagues, wow, don\\'t starves etc, not 3a player xd). i am a little bit worried about the battery life it gets. my daily workflow is like a normal college student - taking lectures, doing projects in coding etc. i am stuck between buying the oled model and the fhd+ model. since bestbuy does not have a deal for customized i9, 32gb, 3050ti with a fhd+ model, i have to get it through the dell website, which is around 2500$ ish i believe. then i realized it is kind of stupid to buy an fhd+ model that is more expensive than the oled one. but i really want to have a fair battery life (like around 7 hours from 100% to 10%). should i get the fhd+ model for 1-1.5hours more in battery life or enjoy the oled with the deal with lower battery life. i am dying choosing between those two, please help me ((((( since i have received my xps 13 plus in june my touchpad gets randomly stuck as if i was continuously clicking. when it reaches this point i cannot do anything in windows : windows gets moved, text gets selected, etc... except plug a mouse when possible. the bug goes randomly away after 1 to 15 minutes but can come back almost immediatly. this is ruining my xps plus experience, do you have any advice ? thanks ! just got my umber xps 13 this morning, had a day to take it to class and i am loving everything! the speakers are so sick for the size of the laptop, the screen (non-touch) looks great and the aspect ratio is very pleasant to look at, the touch pad and keys feel high quality and are really nice to use. the colour was definitely more purple out of the box than i expected but quickly looked so fresh and unique that i\\'m totally fine with wiping off what little finger prints i got throughout my day. battery life was great, took it out of the box and went to 2 of my classes and came home to download wallpapers 5hrs later and when i opened it there was still around 20%. i didn\\'t mess with any of the settings until i got home. (i have the i7, 16gb ram, 1tb ssd) conclusion: i really like the look, the feel, the sound, the battery life and the entire experience. hope it keeps being amazing! i\\'ve not even spent up to 24 hours with this device bro. i noticed this, plugged in to thunderbolt port, it randomly heats up even when doing nothing. paired with a ridiculous fan noise. i made this post while watching youtube (plugged in) and the issue just started is it something an update can fix? or a setting? or anything... does anyone know how to fix the issue where i have to hold the power button for 30 seconds to power on the laptop? i just bought a new dell xps 9320. after i unpacked it. things seemed to work well until i wanted to play a video. i found that the speakers would not work. the control panel indicates that the speakers are blocked. there is no option to unblock them. i plug my headphones into a port replicator and get plenty of sound through them, but still nothing from speakers. the microphone does not work either. i\\';m not a technology guru. does anyone have a suggestion on how to get the speakers to work? this is very sloppy construction for a $1400 laptop! hi! i\\'m having a hard time deciding between these two models both has pros and cons specs thinkpad: i7-12800h 16 gb ddr5-4800mhz 512 gb ssd, m.2 2280, pcie gen 4-ydeevne, tlc, opal nvidia® geforce® rtx™ 3070 ti 8 gb gddr6x 16\" wqxga (2560 x 1600), ips, 100 % srgb, 500 nits, 165 hz specs dell i9-12900hk (i only chose this cpu because it can be undervolted) 16 gb, 2 x 8 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz, dual channel 512 gb m.2 pcie nvme-solid state-disk nvidia® geforce rtx™ 3050 ti, 4 gb gddr6 15,6\", 3.5k 3456 x 2160, 60 hz, oled, med touch, antirefleks, 400 nit, infinityedge disregard the ram and hdd specs because these are both upgradeable on both models. i am going to game on it and i know that thermal will be a problem on both, question is which one has the best thermals. another thing that i cant decide if is the screen. i know the oled on the dell is fucking amazing, but is the lenovo far behind? what are peoples thoughts? title says it all, updated my bios to 1.8.0 through windows update and my egpu no longer works (lenovo legion boost station with rtx2080super) does anyone else have any similar issues with egpus and recent bios updates? i bought the new xps 13 plus just a few months ago. worked perfectly until today when my computer started a firmware update. the update went to 100% with the message that the update was successful. it was stuck on this screen for many hours until my computer died. charged, and upon restart, i got an error saying \"unrecoverable spi error\" and \"error code: 36.\" computer wont startup at all; either stuck on this screen or the screen with the xps logo before shutting back down and restarting. there is also a blinking white/red light above my f6 key on the touchbar. cant find any info on this error in the troubleshoot manual or online. anyone else having this issue after the update? or have any tips for me to try? ty c: i have the xps 15 9510 when it is off the wall power it drains in about 3 hours i usually have chrome open ~10 tabs, outlook, visual studio, slack and teams. not a year old but had this problem since the beginning. what can i do to fix this or check if something is broken? i\\'d like to add at least two monitors and use them for stock trading. thanks. i have a new battery on order and will install upon arrival. however, i wanted to verify something. most of the process looks the same as when i did it on an older xps 9350. however, it looks like with the 9500+ new batteries don\\'t come with the cable permanently attached. it looks like the battery for the 9500, 9510, and 9520 come with a detachable cable. can someone confirm that when i 1) open up the back, 2) gently lift the tape with speaker wire, and 3) remove the battery, the attached cable unplugs from both the board and the battery...and i just reverse the process with the new battery? i\\'m in between the dell xps 13 9305 and the new dell inspiron 16 5620. - link to both specs: https://nanoreview.net/en/laptop-compare/dell-xps-13-9305-vs-dell-inspiron-16-5620?m=c.3_d.2_r.2-and-b.1_c.4_d.2_r.3 i had the inspiron 5559 for years, but it was about 5.4 lbs and quite thick. i\\'ve heard that the xps models have better build quality, but i am worried that it is too small(13.3in) to edit videos on adobe premiere pro and use for college. however, i worried that if i get the inspiron 16, it\\'ll be heavy and the build quality won\\'t last for years. what do y\\'all think? thanks. i have a new dell xps 15 9520, and support assist just won\\'t work. i\\'ve reinstalled it countless times, and it just won\\'t launch, i do get the notifications however... but when i click them, the app launches and remains stuck on the loading screen. it starts with : \"loading optimization tools\" then shows \"this is taking longer than expected. we recommend restarting your pc and trying again\" i tried rebooting, and launching it directly on startup, nothing helps. does anyone else have these issues ? we purchased a xps 15 9520 with a 2tb ssd. device manager says the part# is kxg70pnv2t04, google search results come back as a kioxia toshiba x57 2tb. we\\'re noticing that the new laptop is slower than their 3-year old lenovo. i\\'m scratching my head as to why since the dell has a faster processor, more memory, and a 3-year newer ssd. google searches show a benchmark of sequential write of the ssd as 2,904 mb/sec. i know that\\'s max theoretical, but we\\'re seeing less than half of that, around 900 mb/sec. system is set to performance mode instead of battery optimized. device is plugged into power. i tried verifying with this firmware package that we\\'re running the latest and says it is not a valid device: https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-hk/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=7whp4 so i used dell support assist & windows update to verify the latest drivers are installed for everything. wondering what we\\'re doing wrong, what i\\'ve missed? i know with other brands of ssds, dell does not always have the best driver...but searching kioxia\\'s website, i see nothing in terms of support. https://americas.kioxia.com/en-us/business/ssd/client-ssd.html if you click on xg series, xg7 is skipped between xg8 & xg6. so, what is this mysterious ssd dell is utilizing in this build? i am using fedora with xps as my primary device for work for few months now and it is a pleasant experience so far. so, thought of sharing my experience on setting it up, so that someone having the same setup find it useful. my laptop is an intel i7 11800h with nvidia rtx 3060 laptop in optimus setup with 4k touch screen. system setting - about almost every device worked out of the box, wifi bluetooth speakers mic fingerprint sensor trackpad gestures (in wayland only) for xorg, i need to install few extensions and companion app in the system. https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4245/gesture-improvements/ only for the nvidia card, i had to enable \"rpm fusion\" repository and install the proprietary drivers. instructions available here https://rpmfusion.org/howto/nvidia but with nvidia proprietary drivers installed, all devices working great, even on wayland. though every device is working, i still had few problems. the important one is the battery backup. it was terrible. the battery drains in 2.5 hrs without doing anything intensive. i installed the gnome extension: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4862/bat_consumption_wattmeter/ to monitor my laptop power draw. it consumed 21w on idle. after reading a lot online, it was clear that the nvidia is not powering down completely when not used. by referring the nvidia driver documentation (https://download.nvidia.com/xfree86/linux-x86_64/515.65.01/readme/optimus.html), i made the below changes to the configuration. \\u200b added the below udev configuration file to set the device power to auto. file: /etc/udev/rules.d/80-nvidia-pm.rules # enable runtime pm for nvidia vga/3d controller devices on driver bind action==\"bind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030000\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"auto\" action==\"bind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030200\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"auto\" # disable runtime pm for nvidia vga/3d controller devices on driver unbind action==\"unbind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030000\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"on\" action==\"unbind\", subsystem==\"pci\", attr{vendor}==\"0x10de\", attr{class}==\"0x030200\", test==\"power/control\", attr{power/control}=\"on\" added the below modprobe configuration file to enable dynamic power management. nividia driver documentation says for newer graphics cards, dynamic power management option \\'0x02\\' is the default. but for some reason, it wasn\\'t the case for my setup. i had to enable it explicitly. file: /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-pm.conf options nvidia \"nvreg_dynamicpowermanagement=0x02\" disabled nvidia-powerd and enabled nvidia-persistenced service $ systemctl disable nvidia-powerd.service $ systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced.service restarting after the above configuration changes, my nvidia card properly powering down completely when not used and auto turns on when used by any application. now my system idle in 8w. the other issue i faced is not with fedora, but with the zoom client. i use zoom for work and the latest version of zoom support screen sharing in wayland as well. but it is failing to do so when nvidia graphics card is enabled. if i disable the nvidia card completely using udev rules, the zoom works just fine. but if i enabled it (in hybrid mode), the screensharing is not working. the problem could be in pipewire or zoom, not sure. currently it made to switch to x11. in x11 all working great. steam games works good as well. according to device manager, camera sensor ov01a1b has a problem. hoping it\\'s just a driver issue. i\\'ve opened a support request with dell, just posting here in case anyone else is having the same issue. hi all, my dell xps 9710 was destroyed. i was able to salvage its two internal ssd. let\\'s assume my salvaged ssd are not damaged. if i were to get a replacement xps 9710, can i swap out two ssd in the replacement xps with my salvaged two ssd and expect it to work? kind regards especially during teams sessions, but outside of them as well, i\\'m seeing a lot of stuttering and general slowdowns. to the point that even the mouse pointer won\\'t move for a quarter to half second. this happens contnuously at seeimingly random times. this is most annoying during a teams sessions when i\\'m expected to open a website and do something with it. this is excruciatingly slow. for example, i just measured starting explorer takes a full ten seconds during a teams session. outside a teams session, it\\'s faster. but when i\\'m doing literally anything else, the hickups return. so just to be clear: teams is not the cause, but merely exposes the problem. specs: xps 9570 core i9 8950hk 32gb memory 1tb m.2 ssd gtx 1050ti max-q 4k internal monitor + 4k external via hdmi windows 10 latest mainstream i\\'ve already checked: cpu doesn\\'t get anywhere near 100% neither gpu gets anywhere near 100% plenty of free memory ssd is basically idle cpu temps are around 60-65 gpu temps are around 60-70 all drivers are up-to-date with dell command utility all other software is up-to-date no difference between power plans i have no idea what could be causing these hickups. on paper, there seems to be no reason to be experiencing this. everything seems to be healthy. so why isn\\'t it? the screen goes blank for 1-2 seconds whenever i plugging or unplugging the power cord. i\\'ve upgraded the firmware to the latest version. it\\'s brand new and i\\'ve only installed office, spotify and firefox. can\\'t think of any changes that could cause this problem. has anyone experience with it? i can\\'t afford to send it back for repair, since the new semester begins soon. does anyone know how to upgrade the tb16 thunderbolt dock with the xps 17 9710? the firmware update fails every time. i have tried to downgrade the thunderbolt drivers as other people have suggested but this isn\\'t possible on this machine. i have tried a power cycle and removed all connected peripherals. i need to upgrade the drivers but can\\'t find a way to do so without an older machine. any help would be appreciated :) can anyone tell me what might be happening here? a couple of times recently, i\\'ve come to turn on my laptop in the morning (after shutting it down the night before) and found the battery to be completely flat. i think there was a bios update recently so i\\'m wondering if something in that has stopped the machine from being able to shutdown. https://preview.redd.it/7s5u0sxsu6m91.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5d3f183a98a9167ab87b0bd3bab245260ca4c3f i received my dell xps 9520 from dell uk on 1st september. i would like to return the laptop so i contacted dell and was told that they don\\'t accept returns from business account. is this true? i can\\'t find anything about business account type in policy? thanks the xps mid tower seems like it resonates the noise from my hard drive.. it\\'s pretty loud. my previous pc had multiple spinning drives, but it was much quieter with softer rubber drive mounts and insulated case. has anyone added sound insulation to their xps case? any tips? i\\'m considering automotive sound deadening mats on the sides of the case. anyone know how to just keep the keyboard keys lit on a 15-9720? i\\'ve gotten the dell xps 13 plus about a week ago and last night it started to have a problem. i was not able to shut it down not even resetting it helped. does anyone know how to solve this problem hi all, i set up my xps 13 plus with a dock that also charges my laptop for university, but now i was worried if leaving it charging all the time will damage the battery over time. i had an old dell laptop that’s battery died this way, and i don’t want that to happen with my xps. i recently got a xps 13 plus like 1 week ago and it\\'s starting to have a shutdown problem last night whenever i try to shutdown after a few seconds it automatically reboots. i\\'ve tried to reset it and it doesn\\'t seem to do anything. i will get this laptop for work, and i plan to install linux on it, it will be mainly used as a development machine, so recent packages, good video performance for zoom calls, and predictable operation is a must. i have been using manjaro on a 4 years old thinkpad and didn\\'t face any problems with it, except some problems with sleep when i was using wayland. i\\'m wondering whether i will have the same experience on this xps machine, or it would be better to install fedora or ubuntu on it. it also has nvidia rtx 3050 ti if it makes any difference(most likely will be disabled most of the time) my dell xps 13 plus turns on by itself a few seconds after i shut it down using the windows power menu or the holding the power button. i\\'ve tried all these: turning off fast boot going into bios and disabling settings that allow the device to wake on its own windows reset the dell diagnostic test also shows that all systems are working fine. the bios logs show \"power on - not applicable\" does anyone know how to fix this? currently plugged in official charger and a type c monitor cable which also offer 60w of charging. just wanna know which charge power does the notebook will consume? and can i config which power to draw? \\u200b xps 17 9710 hi everyone, i bought the new dell xps 17 3 weeks ago, and coming from a macbook, let\\'s just say that it required more adjustments than what i\\'m used too. i resolved every minor issue except a 20 to 30 watts battery drain at idle, wifi off, the nvdia gpu not drawing any watts, processor at 3-5w, and brightness all the way down. the thing that gets me is that when i boot it up everything is fine, it draws around 9 watts, but it\\'s only after a few hours of use or when i plug it in and then try to use it on battery that the issue appear. i deinstalled nvidia geforce experience, drivers are updated and i checked task manager, disabled everything i could, and paired with hwinfo, i still doesn\\'t find the cause of it. any idea or similar experience ? \\u200b thanks in advance as per title, my wife updated her xps bios using the dell-provided executable, as we have done every other time, and right after the update she saw a message that said \"multiple docking stations are not simultaneously supported. disconnect additional docking stations\". there is only one dell wd19tb dock connected to the laptop, plus the power adapter (as the dock cannot power the laptop on its own). after disconnecting and reconnecting the dock and power supply, we get this: \"your port does not accept power. to supply power to your system while docked, attach a power adapter to your system\", even though there is a power adapter connected. we tried a second dell power adapter, same issue. the bios reports the power adapters are supplying 15w, but of course two dell adapters can\\'t both break in the same way at the same time. is this a botched dell update? is anyone else seeing this? should we attempt a bios downgrade to 1 or 2 versions back? any ideas will be very welcome, as the laptop now does not charge the battery, except extremely slowly when it\\'s powered off, so it can only be used for however long the battery lasts (although we have not let the battery drain completely yet to see if it will in fact run on the adapter despite what it reports). hi all, i\\'ve been using the 9520 i7 12700h 3050ti for a month now. i\\'m curious to what idle temps similar specced devices are getting. i\\'m idling around 44 degrees c. the machine picks up temps quickly and races to 100 (not on all cores). but it quiets down quickly, too. i was able to get to these temps when i turn down everything that leverages the gpu. when boths chips are in use, the cooling system gets saturated easily. fan noise is also quite enjoyable, fans are mostly off or inaudible, battery life is also acceptable, dispite the oled screen what idle temps are you getting ? i mostly want it to protect the finish of the laptop. i have been looking everywhere and found nothing. i don\\'t know if the old 9310 skins will fit the 9315 or not. anyone had any luck? on august 31, 2022 i ordered a dell xps 15 9520 with the 12th gen i-9 processor with 32 gigs of ram & 1t of ssd storage. i\\'m having some pre-delivery buyers regret over dell\\'s proprietary 130-watt usb-c power delivery, my dream was to be able to use an aftermarket docking station like the pluggable & my ravpower 90-watt 2-port wall charger on the go to charge my samsung note 20 & \"a usb-c pd laptop.. since placing the order i learn you need to use dell\\'s expensive & port limited limited dell thunderbolt™ dock – wd22tb4. should i \"pull the plug\" on this order (time is of the essence) shipping 9-6-22? any sage wisdom would be greatly appreciated! is this normal? i have the oled version but is it really just because of that? do i have to install windows 11 to fix this? i would appreciate any help! https://preview.redd.it/9njxtc0e6ol91.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a71a32d506903b0098214c7210cf54d2ae0297 hi there, a couple weeks ago i got an open box xps 9520 from best buy. from the beginning, i noticed it would randomly blue screen. i’ve been trying to look it up to see if others have this problem but i’m not finding anything about the 9520, nor “random” blue screens. this will literally happen when i’m surfing the web, gaming, or just navigating through settings, etc. i read something about switching the ssd in bios to ahci, so i did that. but then that caused my computer to not be able to start up at all, and now it’s currently reinstalling windows and resetting completely. i’m hoping this will fix the issue, but not sure yet. does anyone have any insight into what’s going on? i like to think i’m pretty techy but this is my first windows computer in a while after a life full of macs, and most of what i’m reading online is very confusing. i know basic troubleshooting but windows stuff seems like it’s a whole other level. i’ve been buying and returning laptop after laptop trying to find the perfect one, and outside of this issue, i really love the look, speed, gaming, and graphic capabilities of this one, so i’m really hoping to make it work. just received my new dell xps13 (9315) - so far so good. i\\'d like to put ubuntu as a dual book with windows 11 but having an issue with the usb pen drive (for ubuntu boot) showing up on my bios boot screen, presumably as the two ports are thunderbolt port and require the adaptor to accept the usb pen drive. using this guide - link can anyone help with what settings are needed in the bios to recognise the pen drive or a work-arround? thanks in advance. hi, my new xps 9320 came with a 60w compact usb-c charger. like some tests say: it is simply not strong enough. especially if i use my dongle at home with 2screens (hdmi, the dp ports are occupied for the gaming pc), mouse, keyboard, ext. harddrive, ethernet. there is even a bios notification that it‘s too weak. any ideas how to upgrade properly? i‘m quite hesitant at this point to spend a couple hundred € for a docking station, that doesn’t really fit my needs and is not meant to be portable. thank you guys in advance already. ☺️ edit: when browsing the dell site the only thing that comes up is either the docking station, or a 65w power bank. i have a problem with my new xps 9520. it seem that the suspension, even if set to do so in the windows (both the old \"control panel\" and the new setting page) doesn\\'t suspend the laptop when closing the lid, but only turns off the screen. this obviously results in serious laptop overheating, especially when put into a bag it\\'s boiling hot, that concerns me because it can damage it. for now i\\'ve solved by changing the behavior to hibernate the computer and not suspend, that solves the risk of frying my new computer, but obviously that is not ideal since it will take more time to wake up and it\\'s annoying. has anyone the same issue? if so how it is solved? i didn\\'t change the installation of windows 11 and this is the stock one (and maybe that is the problem since i should have do that to remove all the bloatware preinstalled...) listening to spotify/youtube/etc has been challenging since att volume level 2-4 it\\'s already max loudness and if i increased it to 10 it would probably blow my headphones. there\\'s this maxx audio pro waves app, is that the issue? hi, i have a custom pc that i built, ryzen 7 3700x - gtx 1660 super - 32 ddr4 3600 - 1 t ssd - m.2 500 gb. and i\\'m sick of getting stuck in one place just for my work, i need a laptop to switch my desk stations from home & office. i got an offer to switch my pc for dell xps 17 9710 , should i take it or there are other choices? has anybody followed the github for building the intel ipu6 webcam drivers to see if this gets the webcam working for apps like cheese and howdy on kernel 5.15? \\u200b https://github.com/intel/ipu6-drivers i got this device about 4 months ago and have just come to notice that the screen has developed a small curve. there seems to be a gap between the lid and the body, but it opens and closes like normal. there is no gap evident anywhere other than in that middle portion going across horizontally. since i don\\'t have a point of reference of what is considered good, could someone help me figure out if i should send this back to dell for a replacement or if this is within margin of error? \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/vqcp2ab9whl91.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e48272f12476fab03fa2c0c863d44a4039d4c133 https://preview.redd.it/90rdfdb9whl91.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91134ba18db69a8df4cb6bf9c00afbf63724355c hi everyone, i have been using my xps 15 for 2 years and i am more than satisfied. now my girlfriend is searching for a new laptop, we were thinking about xps 13 plus but due to many issues that laptop has we decided to go with normal xps 13 is it as buggy as plus? i have had my dell xps 15 laptop for a few weeks and it is serving me really well. i only have some major problems with the audio that i have not previously experienced with any other laptop or device. i can never seem to get the right sound. sound lacks bass and just sounds very distorted overall. and most of the time the laptop doesn\\'t even realise it is connected to external speakers. i re-installed the drivers many times and even tried the drivers from 9500 and 9510 from dell\\'s website without succes. i suspect these problems are caused by the bloatware (maxxaudio and waves) that dell ships with the devices. has anybody worked this out. i have little experience in this field but isn\\'t there like a general windows audio driver that just \\'works\\'? anybody any suggestions? so this might be a little random, but i\\'m noticing the feet for the laptop (the two bars at the bottom that are rubber) are getting grooved from regular use on surfaces. i don\\'t even slide it often if nearly at all during my workflow but i\\'m noticing grooves formed and i wanted to check and just with my nail it seemed like i could almost completely peel off the feet if i wanted to. i\\'m concerned if down the line i\\'ll barely have any laptop feet left, since i intend to use this for as long as i can. any ideas? hello! i have bought the dell xps13 plus. i have a gigabyte m28u monitor which is able to give out 4k resolution. i am unable to use my monitor as a second screen after trying the following: when i connect the monitor via a 6-in-1 hub from baseus using an hdmi 2.1 cable to the hdmi port on the monitor: it shows \"out of range\" on the monitor screen. when i connect the laptop using the usb-c cable from the box to the usb-c port on the monitor, it shows the same error. i need support for this. please help. is there any generally accepted fix for dell\\'s heavy handed gpu throttling in the 9510 with 3050 ti? it seems like, with the laptop propped up, the fans can handle around 30w gpu power, but the only power options seem to be 45w or 20w, and as soon as the gpu exceeds 75 degrees power gets pulled and stays at 20w pretty much forever, even after temps drop back to the low 60s (which is basically idle temp). i disabled cpu boost and set ultra performance mode in the bios. fans are a little louder, but same overall behavior. this is mainly popping up in destiny 2, where i was oddly able to run at 60fps for hours no problem this weekend but now i\\'m suddenly getting throttling after 5 minutes or so. i upgraded from an old 6th gen xps to the new one for my personal work laptop. overall i love the device, but the finger print reader is frustrating the hell out of me. i can get an accurate read about 25% of the time, and after 3 failed reads i have to enter my pin which defeats the whole point.... anybody else struggling with the fingerprint reader or is it just me? i\\'m currently buying a laptop. and i\\'m torn between two options: - getting dell xps 13 plus for uni work, notes, light gaming and watching content + a gaming pc - getting a fully specced asus rog zephyrus g14 for the same stuff plus heavier gaming i live in poland and fully specced xps 13 plus would cost me around 2300 dollars, fully specced rog zephyrus 14 would cost me around 2400 dollars. i generally love the zephyrus g14 looks, but i\\'m really having the shots for the oled screen on xps 13 plus (and i\\'m currently and xps 15 9575 owner). anyone care to give me some thoughts? i have a dell xps 9510 laptop. each night i shut it down via start > shutdown (not just closing the lid), however at 00:34 it boots itself up without explanation. this has happened for at least 7+ days in a row, potentially longer. i\\'ve disabled fast boot, scheduled automatic maintenance is set for 17:00, disabled wake timers and ensured that there are no scheduled tasks set for this time or even have the ability to boot the laptop. wake on lan is also disabled. event viewer clearly shows the machine shutting down with a message saying \"the operating system is shutting down at system time...\" but then at 00:34 there\\'s a message saying \"the operating system started at system time \\u200e2022\\u200e-\\u200e08\\u200e-\\u200e30t23:34:02.500000000z.\" with nothing in between. i\\'ve checked the bios options and the function to wake up the machine at a certain time is entirely disabled. i\\'ve also used the commands; powercfg -lastwake and powercfg -waketimers. the first always reports 0 and the second always says that there are no waketimers. the machine is not connected to a bluetooth device, screen, keyboard or anything like that. i work in it but i have no idea where to go with this one... currently using xps 17 9710 to play world of warship. plugged in to original charger, but the system still drained around 13% just for just a 10 min online game. any help so the system battery will not drain while i play? this is not acceptable i just got the 9320 for uni, and was wondering if i can replace the cable and brick for a normal usb c charger. anker has some 60w ones that i would go for, to be able to carry less. i just got my xps 9320 yesterday, and i\\'ve been wondering what i should use for the power control. should i be using windows or dell\\'s? should i use both depending on my work case? i will be using the laptop for university engineering, and if i need more performance is it best to set both window\\'s and dell\\'s to the highest performance version, or just one or the other? new xps 13 plus, fan just runs and runs and runs full blast. updated bios everything. even when i put it to sleep the fan just keeps on going full bore. so annoying. the different modes did nothing at all, quiet did not make it quiet. trying a factory reset now, maybe an app i installed caused some issue. idk, getting fed up with dell. i recently bought this computer for editing and color grading and i have been really happy with it so far, except for one thing : the colors are too saturated. but not all of them, it\\'s mostly noticeable in the reds. i made my researches and concluded that this must have been because of the vivid gamut applied by default<; i installed premiercolor to change it to srgb but there was no changes in color. i temporarily uninstalled premiercolor and reduced the global saturation in the intel settings but this is still less than ideal because i can\\'t trust my screen to grade, even though the colors are actually really accurate in terms of hue. i know this has been an issue since a few years so i\\'ve been wondering if someone knew a possible fix. hi guys, brand new dell xps 13 9320 laptop - 3 days old. ran all the updates etc etc. while using noticed 2 keys stopped working when you press them. -> the \"k\" and \"i\" keys. after opening up a sep notepad and confirming by typing out every key and noticing these keys are almost \"dead\" not reflecting, i rebooted the pc. upon reboot, it works, both keys register, k and i. but leave it and then it goes on standby and wakes up again and back to issue, \"k\" and \"i\" are not working. so firstly this is cant be a hardware issue. its obvy running windows 11 being 2022. next i rebooted, having read that bios factory settings reset helps... seemingly did, but again, keys die once the laptop sleeps or standbys and re-awakens. keyboard device manger driver issue you say? -> went to device manager and looked at both hid and ps2 keyboard devices and drivers are from like 2006... anything i can do? i mean... whats happening to dell... buy and xps and get these random things happening? hello, this is my first ever reddit post, so hopefully, i do it right. i recently got a dell xps 17 9720 with the 12th gen intel i9, 3060, 32gb of ram, 1 tb of storage, and the 1920 x 1200 fhd display. i\\'m an engineering student so i got this device to have a balance of power and portability. however, my experience with this device has been completely disappointing. the first one they sent me had a defective screen. the replacement they sent me has a good screen, however, when it\\'s not plugged in the battery behaves very oddly. i have the brightness set to 40%, i uninstalled all the bloatware, i have disabled several processes from running in the background, and i disabled the 3060. just using google chrome and word i typically get between 2 to 2.5 hours of battery life. according to the mydell app, the battery typically discharges at a rate of 35-40% per hour. it doesn\\'t matter if i have all my apps closed, it will still discharge at this rate. what is really random is that on two occasions it has discharged at a normal rate. for example, i played a looped youtube video for three hours and the battery went from 100% to 71%. i repeated this test a few hours later and the battery went from 71% to 10% in two hours. everything was the same during both tests. i\\'ve been in contact with dell support, but they have been completely not helpful. i\\'m attaching a screenshot from a battery report i ran. you\\'ll notice that the discharge rate is not consistent, despite that i am performing the same tasks. i\\'m curious to hear some non-corporate feedback. https://preview.redd.it/ej3nbogh04l91.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b53a33da02dfe4fa61504b6fe08123379b57c5 looking to buy a scratch and dent outlet with 32 gb. is it possible to add another 32gb to this? if so, is this cheaper than just going with a 64gb? i recently bought an xps 15 9520 fhd+ an was really happy, except the display had a flaw and so now id like to get the oled version instead. however, (at least in the eu / germany) even after hours of searching, i am unable to find any store where this is sold. is this a known / common problem or am i just blind? so i got my 9320 dev edition on sunday and have been setting it up since then, but i\\'m noticing serious battery drain in daily use. specs are i7 1260p, 16gb ram, 1200p touchscreen. it feels like i see the battery percentage drain by one point every few minutes. is this normal for anybody else that has this setup? i would expect this sort of battery drain if i had gotten the oled version, but maybe my expectations are just too high. \\u200b looking at power statistics, my battery dropped from 92% to 46% in like 3-3.5 hours. this was with brightness set to 50%. does this seem normal to y\\'all? hey y\\'all, i\\'ve a dell xps 17 9710 that i\\'ve only lightly used because of an issue where if i try to use the trackpad with anything plugged in, such as the charger that came with the laptop or a usb-a card reader plugged into the adapter, it\\'ll stutter in place or jump around onscreen in a way that doesn\\'t match my touch input. just recently i\\'ve also been noticing ghost clicks when i type and my mouse jumping around when i use the touchscreen (similar to trackpad); both of these only occur when something is plugged in or immediately after it\\'s unplugged, and are far more infrequent than the touchpad issue, but i\\'m worried that this will all only get worse since the latter two are relatively new developments. i\\'m pretty much computer illiterate aside from the good ole \\'update the drivers\\' and \\'turn it off and on again\\', so any advice would be greatly appreciated. dell essentially shrugged at me because i\\'m out of warranty because of course lol dell has acknowledged some adhesive issues with the 13\" model. hopefully this is just an initial production run quirk... \"dell technologies places the highest priority on the quality of our products. we discovered that some screens on the xps 13 plus oled systems may become loose because of problems with the third-party adhesive used, and we quickly corrected the issue in our production process. dell is proactively reaching out to customers who may be impacted to replace the screen, ideally before it becomes loose.\" i recently bought an xps 15 9520 fhd+ an was really happy, except the display had a flaw and so now id like to get the oled version instead. however, (at least in the eu / germany) even after hours of searching, i am unable to find any store where this is sold. is this a known / common problem or am i just blind? hi! one of the laptops i\\'m considering is the base model dell xps 15 without dedicated graphics. however, here in italy, this model has a smaller 57 wh battery rather than the standard 86 wh battery. i cannot find any reviews or opinions on those configuration. if one of you knows anything, i\\'d be grateful if you let me know! i\\'m particularly worried about battery life. aside from this: how\\'s qa this time around? should i still go ahead and buy or is it a \"please please please don\\'t buy\" scenario? used to have a xps 15 7590 and bought a new xps 17 9710 both ddr 4 ram. is it possible to switch from 7590 (32gb) and use it on 9710? im not a tech guy but both spec said ddr4 so im thinking is it possible. thanks. looks like the xps 13 plus also has a video lag issue, with an update to fix it. dell released a bios update, 1.7.1, today with the changelog: - fixed the issue where the system lags when you play a video on youtube. i have not been able to figure out how to turn off the backlight of the touch function keys. does anyone here know how to do it? haven\\'t had this issue personally, but saw some people on here have it. dell released a driver update, 31.0.101.3301 a03, on the 26th of august with the changelog: - fixed the issue where the 4k video lags after system is resumed from sleep mode. hope this works for y\\'all! hello! i just got my dell xps 13 plus 9320 and wanted an extra ac adapter for travel but i can\\'t find any adapters on dell\\'s website that say they are compatible with the 9320. it says on the ac adapter it\\'s 60w type c but on dell\\'s website they don\\'t have one that says it works with 9320 on the compatibility tab. any help? thank you! i bought this laptop a few days ago and found that whenever i connect an audio device to it, the sound comes out as if it were being played twice. i\\'ve tried making sure that the realtek drivers are up to date and windows is as well, but it hasn\\'t solved anything. the audio also comes out sounding normal when i play it though the built-in speakers. has anyone ever had this problem, or knows how to fix it? hi! i\\'m considering purchasing a dell xps 15 9520 configured with i5-12500h, 16 gb ram, 512 gb storage, a full hd display and a 57 wh battery. no nvidia, just integrated xe. it\\'s not the only laptop i\\'m considering, so i\\'m looking around. it should be €1599 - 15%, which should be €1359. however, i couldn\\'t find any reviews or opinions on this unit. all the reviews i found are of the i7, rtx, oled model which is basically a different machine. it seems like it\\'s a regional thing: here in italy, dell punishes you for wanting the base model with a 57 wh battery. does anybody have this model? i\\'m worried about battery life on if, since 57 wh seems pretty low for an h-class intel cpu with ~54 w of tdp. it\\'s competing against a thinkpad e15 g4 intel - it\\'s slower and with a worse display, but it should have s3 sleep (real suspend mode, not the one that burns the laptop in your backpack) unlike the dell, battery life is solid on it and - the elephant in the room - it\\'s €400 cheaper. i could consider spending the extra €400 if it\\'s worth it, but poor battery life could be a deal breaker. also, are there any other considerations or things i should keep in mind? battery life? how\\'s performance and heat on this model? is linux support still alright? no external webcam driver needed? i\\'d buy this pc mostly for linux, so i\\'m interested. how\\'s qa this time round? if anyone could help me, i\\'d be very happy :) i have a new xps 13 9315, 16gb ram, i7 cpu. so far it looks fine, just have couple of questions. why is the fan running at max speed when i am not doing anything? all i have is google chrome and outlook open. laptop is laggy when i am charging it, any idea why? it works fine when it is not charging. i just placed an order for the new dell xps two in one 9315. if nothing gets delayed it should be here by september 21st. in the meantime, are there any places that sell the tempered glass screen protectors or does anyone know if the laptop version will fit on this screen? i also plan to use it like a tablet so i wonder if they will be making a hardcase for it? kind of like the one that latitude detachable has. this will be my first convertible/ detachable pc and i’m excited to try it out. i chose this one out over the microsoft surface 8. just a psa to others considering the 9710: it overheats when transporting due to the standby mode (ironically, called \"modern\" standby mode). it would be a good laptop if this were fixed, but it is still not fixed. packed my laptop and charger to college. i heard that my charger might be bent. any fix to this? hi ! i\\'m currently looking to buy the new dell xps 13 9315 but i don\\'t know which cpu to chose, i5-1230u or i7-1250u ? actually i can have the i7 version for the same price as the i5 version because of an offer from dell\\'s website in france, so i would say the choice is obvious. but i\\'m worried the i7 version will affect battery life too much or will need the fan to run faster and make more noise... what do you think ? also, i heard a few times that the keyboard backlight on the sky blue color is really bad and makes keys less visible, if someone have the laptop, can you confirm ? if yes, is it the case even in dark conditions ? (if you can, i\\'d like to see pictures with backlight on and off to get an idea!) thanks in advance ! just josh reviewed the xps 13 plus and said the quality control was awful. hi, i’ve recently got into gaming on laptop after years of console fancied something different and i’ve had the idea of building a pc for some time but haven’t got a clue where to start but i thought instead i’ll just play steam on my laptop (xps 13 9310) in the meantime. the specs are: intel i7 core 16gb memory intel iris xe graphics windows 11 i was looking at playing some bigger size games e.g dying light 2 which require better graphics cards but again, i don’t know much about specs. is it worth continuing to buy games on that spec laptop? or is a pc better? thanks! i\\'m looking to buy an xps 15 9520 for college and i\\'m torn between the fhd+ and the 3.5k oled screen. i\\'m mostly worried about the pwm flicker on the oled screen, otherwise it probably wouldn\\'t be such a hard decision as it is now. do a lot of people experience the flicker issue with the oled screen on xps? and are there possible fixes to it? it seems as if the screen of the xps 13 is so heavy that as soon as it is opened the bottom left corner lifts and doesn\\'t touch the ground. it is only the case for that corner and only as soon as i open it. is this normal or should i send it back to get it fixed. as the title says, i don\\'t see any indicator light that signals the battery is full. do you have to manually turn on the laptop every time to check? i\\'m looking to buy the xps 15 9520 with 12th gen intel cpu, and i noticed that on the official dell website the ones with an i9 cpu actually come $300 cheaper than the ones with i7 (thanks to \"limited time offer!\"). but from what i\\'ve heard the i9 might actually perform worse compared to the i7 on such a small chassis due to throttling, as well as consume battery faster. anybody know if that\\'s actually going to be the case, and if it is, whether it can be solved or compensated for with underclocking/undervolting? i have an xps 15 9510, and the overnight drain is ridiculous. i constantly wake up with a dead laptop. i can\\'t seem to find a fix for this. trying to hibernate always is also not helping that much. does anyone know how to fix this? this was not a problem in old laptops. how did they make something worse? i\\'m trying to buy the xps 15 9520 (i7, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd, 3.5k oled, frost white) for school, and i can either get a new one for about $2,238 (shipping and tax included), or i can get a refurbished, \"like new\" one from the outlet for $2,194 (so about $44 cheaper), and this one comes with 32gb ram instead of 16gb (which frankly isn\\'t super important to me). i would usually go for the new one because the price difference is so little, but i\\'m still debating because 1. the new one is expected to be delivered between sep. 7-12, while the refurbished one only takes about 3-5 business days once shipped, and 2. i\\'ve heard that the refurbished ones might actually be less prone to qc issues because they go through more rigorous testing and inspection. what do you guys think i should get? p.s. any coupons/codes i can use at the us outlet? basically what the title says i bought it with the 3050ti and i7 but i didn’t have the option to choose the larger battery capacity. could i switch the batteries if i need to or is it physically impossible. would i need to reflash the bios or anything like that? so, i got an xps 13 plus right when it released, because i needed a new laptop before college started up again. it\\'s been good! the cooling seems better than it was on my old one, which is nice. however, one weird thing is the haptic track-pad. sometimes, it\\'ll just get stuck in the \"down\" position, and i have to tap my finger pretty forcefully to get it unstuck. additionally, certain parts of the track-pad have a weird, loud click, while the other sections have the typical muffled one. has anyone else experienced issues like this? is there anything i can do to resolve them? hi, i noticed that on the official dell website the xps 15 9520 actually comes about $300 cheaper with i9-12900hk cpu than ones with i7-12700h and otherwise identical specs (thanks to \"limited time offer\"), but i\\'m worried that the i9 could actually be a worse option for the xps 15 than i7, in terms of battery life, throttling, heating, etc., let alone have a better performance. does anybody know if that\\'s going to be the case? also, if it is the case, could it be solved or compensated for with underclocking or something? thanks. my xps 9305 crashed and they replaced my hard drive. now when i go to system settings and see my computer name, it is showing precision tower 3240 under my cpu name rather than xps 9305. anybody know why this would happen or if it even affects me at all? thanks! i had to reinstall windows and now don\\'t have this wallpaper to choose from.

and performance are starting to lack. when adding a monitor for example, just simple things like browsing and watching videos start to stutter and slow down. i\\'m now in the market for a new laptop, but i\\'m not sure what i want. i\\'m not in college anymore, so the mobility isn\\'t really important and gaming is neither, so a dedicated gpu isn\\'t needed. i have looked into three options: xps 13 plus (i5, 16gb ram, 512gb) for €1379 xps 13 \\'new\\' (i5, 16gb ram, 512gb) €1161 inspiron 14 (i5, 16gb ram, 512gb) for €900 the price difference between the 13 plus and the inspiron 14 is steep, but the performance probably isn\\'t, or am i missing something? why not go for the latitude? is the quality that much lower? i got my xps 15 in the mail today, and wanted to test out how it fairs playing games. to my surprise, there is some pretty bad screen tearing happening. i have vsync on in-game and in the nvidia control panel. i have set the game to use the 3050. i have tried lowering the display refresh rate. i have tried turning vsync off and capping the fps below 60. \\u200b is anyone else experiencing this? does anyone have any idea what to do? thanks so much \\u200b my specs are as follows: display: uhd+ (3840 x 2400) memory: 16gb cpu: 12th generation intel core i7-12700h video card: nvidia(r) geforce rtx(tm) 3050 main review: i wanted to love the 9315 but unfortunately i am sending it back. i really do love the design and speakers etc. the speakers are really an upgrade from the 9310. the chassis is incredibly solid for how thin the unit is. the keyboard is also ok, however, it hass much worse travel than my samsung ativbook 12.2 which i will make comparisons to throughout this review as it is a similar subnotebook, and both are about the same thickness. the hinge felt extremely solid. i like how the power button has a different tactile feel from the other buttons. it is also recessed which should prevent accidental key presses when folks are reaching for delete. dell did a nice job with modern standby power draw on this machine. \\u200b i thought that with the ultra low wattage cpu, the fan would be hardly ever on and i would get great battery life. when i first saw this online, it reminded me of my old ativbook 12.2 from sansung which was an awesome device for its time. it stopped reminding me of the ativbook as soon as i started using it. out of the box, the fan in mine made a rattling noise which got louder when the unit is moved or tilted. i could have gotten my fan replaced but had other concerns. the fan curve is totally mysterious to me. it runs at a low speed even when the cpu is at 80 degrees f. when i ran a compile job on all cores, it ran at a max cpu temp of about 122 to 130 degrees f with the fan running loud. an always or almost always running fan won\\'t be good for battery life. maybe they run the fan so much to keep skin temps under control, but i prefer silent running and longer battery. if we are going to have a fan, why not better performance that comes with fans; notebookcheck says this runs half the speed of the i5 p chip in the plus. i would be much more accepting of this speed reduction if this unit was fanless. the ativbook was fanless, and performed well for a machine without a fan for its time. i was hoping the xps fan would only run when i really pushed it and also spread its wings a little bit with the headroom of the fan to give me good performance. instead, we got the disadvantages of both the fanless and fan machines in this design. my old 9310 kept its fan off until a much higher temp was reached and ran passively almost all the time which was one reason i loved it. if you want to run linux, the webcam requires a proprietary kernel driver and software that isn\\'t in most linux distros so unless you run dell\\'s modified ubuntu image, getting the camera working is a nightmare if you dual boot or run linux exclusively. i don\\'t know much about windows, however, from what i read, it seems like folks are having stability issues with the drivers on that operating system as well. when pushing on the display of the 9315 lightly next to the camera (i do this to open the lid), the unit makes a creaking/cracking noise. the old 9310 had metal reinforcement in front of the display which held it firmly in place. i wish i had kept my 9310 as it was rock solid. based on what i am hearing about the 9320 and my experience with the 9315, it really seems like dell wrecked a good thing with these new units. there is so much out there with similar specs for less money that will perform better, which i saw from benchmarks that had come out after i ordered my unit. i went for the xps because i was hoping for the build, reliability, and linux support that xps is known for, even though i knew there were other machines in this class with more performance. the main theme i have noticed this year for better performance seems to be ryzen. the asus s13 is in this same class and gets great ratings although i have never seen one. i had a friend with a hp devone and that really impressed me; that might be a possibility if you want rock solid linux support as it runs with the mainline kernel just fine according to my friend (i will likely go this route). the devone is slightly thicker, however, you get the nifty trackpoint, great travel keyboard, and all sorts of ports, as well as great cooling. things that i originally looked over due to my experience of reliability, and good linux mainline support with xps in the past: dell claims they removed the headphone jack from the 9315 to meet design goals. the ativbook 12.2 was thinner then the 9315 and had two usb a, mini hdmi, power, and headphone. i know dell wants a certain look with these machines that probably doesn\\'t include usb a ports, however, one more usb c and micro sd reader would have been great additions to the 9315. if you are using headphones and charging, you are out of ports. asus included the headphone jack and an extra usb c on their s13 for a total of three and it is a similar thickness. the asus and ativbook don\\'t have soldered sds and the 9315 does. i knew about these disadvantages when i bought the xps, however, i was willing to look past them due to my positive experiences with linux support, build quality, and reliability of previous xps units; now they just add to the other disadvantages. improvements i\\'d like to see next year: i get that this isn\\'t supposed to be the ultra fast machine for developers. if we are going to keep this chassis next year with minimal ports and the soldered ssd, lets get rid of that fan and add a 60 or 70wh battery so its an all day extremely portable machine. this would make the soldered ssd, and few ports worthwhile. i could see myself owning the machine i just described, as well as a slightly thicker machine for my heavy compiling jobs. dell innovated on the outside of the xps 13+ with the touchbar and new keyboard, which although i think is pretty neat, i won\\'t buy because i am a developer and like to be able to strike the fn keys by touch when using my editor. maybe next year, they can focus the innovation effort on the inside and determine a way to cool the successor to the 9315 ultra thin model without a fan. i\\'d also like to see dell moving back to a place where there machines are supported by the mainline linux kernel, as opposed to needing proprietary linux images. there has been great work with xps fingerprint readers now being supported, however, the lack of support for the web camera in these latest models is a backslide. hp releasing the devone provides serious linux competition from another main manufacture of laptops, and dell will need to step up their game to compete. yesterday afternoon i ordered the umber xps 13 9315 with the i7, non touch, 16gb ram and 1tb ssd. thoughts on this configuration? ps. i almost ordered the 13 plus but saw so many bad reviews from reddit, youtube etc. the display model at best buy was really nice other than the price and the keyboard being weirdly backlit. 9315 ftw hi everyone, i have a brand new dell xps 15 9520. to give everyone some background the battery is the 86wh one but when i ran my battery test it was already at 75wh so i will be contacting dell at least about that. i do not run my gpu mostly because i haven’t needed to so far. i keep the brightness low on campus 50% or below and battery saver is always on. any help would be greatly appreciated i think the gpu might still be reviving power but i’m not sure. thank you! i need \\u200f\\u200f\\u200e to bustle vmware for a class but when i try to run a virtual machine my dell xps 9310 2-in-1 becomes unresponsive. has anyone else experienced this? did you notice a while back that the xps 13 plus online page at best buy disappeared as well? 100% either they all got recalled or are temporarily discontinued from selling it until they get new batches. wonder if a best buy employee has info on this i want to try linux on my xps 15 9520. i\\'m trying to boot from a usb and despite changing the boot order on the laptop, i still can\\'t get it to boot from the usb. does anybody have any ideas? i have this for work. i got the 2k display, i7, 16gb ram (my other one is the same specs but 32gb ram). i dont game on it. i have chrome, skype for business, teams and active directory open. had it open almost 45 minutes now, screen at half brightness, and im at 68% batter from 100%...i don\\'t get it. i turned off the high performance and what not. everything is up to date on it. i love this laptop but it\\'s less than a month old and this is insane. any ideas? very frustrating when you spend a lot of $$ on a lab top only to have the mother board fail. literally this thing is only 1 year and 1 month old.....of course just after the warranty expires. i would like to buy a new xps laptop. is it worth buying 9315. i have not seen anyone reliable talk about it or review it so, i just grabbed an sk hynix p31 2tb as i was waiting for it to drop again and was wondering the best way to install in my xps 15. i know it has a second slot as i saw it upgrading my ram, but should i 1) install the drive in the second slot, clone and swap drives or 2) clone externally and replace, moving the oem drive to the other slot 3) install, clone and change the start up drive in bios 4) install the drive in the first slot and start with a clean slate? i really don\\'t want to have to do option 4 as i\\'ve installed a lot of applications/configurations since i got it, but i\\'ve heard that cloning ssds can sometimes lead to performance issues. just trying to get some ideas from folks who\\'ve done this. thank you! edit: obviously meant to type 9510. thanks after update the bios i have issue with display resolution. every restart or shut down/start resolution is changed to 800x600. i must everytime change it in display setting to 4k :/ has anyone this issue? i just ordered an xps 17 (9720), and i\\'m wondering if the 9720\\'s oem configuration supports an 8tb ssd in a single m.2 slot. according to this thread, the 9710 could be made to support an 8tb ssd in either or both slots, but this required removal of the oem dell software that limited it to 4tb in each slot. the linked redditor claimed that they achieved 8tb+8tb storage by arranging the two drives in ahci (not raid) after a fresh, non-oem windows installation. anybody know if this same workaround is still necessary on the 9720, or if it still works? does anyone know how to fix the problem with the killer wifi ax1650s on the xps 15 9510? it seems like i am having the same problem that many other people have described: the wifi is just really slow. not only are the max speeds terrible, it must be resending a lot of packets as pages take a very long time to start loading. it really makes the experience of browsing the internet (or downloading, or streaming) very frustrating. there are a few pieces of advice in previous threads, such as this one, which seem to have worked for many people, but they\\'re out of date: the versions of software it describes are no longer available (in fact the whole killer site just redirects to intel), and those steps didn\\'t work for me. the wifi card is soldered to the motherboard so there is no replacing it. any advice or hints would be much appreciated! hi guys, looking to buy a dell xps 9520, and want to add a second 1tb ssd for an ubuntu installation. does the second ssd slot support a 1tb ssd? cheers hey folks, i\\'m using a single xps 13 plus laptop and want to figure out the best solution for 2 monitors. can i daisy-chain a u2722d to the u2722de and still get full resolution/speed over the single usb-c from the new xps 13 plus? or are there going to be some trade-offs i need to consider? thanks has anyone else been shipped a separate audio adapter by dell if you own an xps 13 plus? mine came with one but it was branded \"lenovo\" when i plugged it in, which i thought was just weird at the time. maybe it was a manufacturing/boxing error and they\\'re sending out dell branded units? i am using the new dell xps 15 9520 since a month. there was no trackpad issue at the time i received it but now, the trackpad has sunk in one corner after regular usage for a month of usage. what can i do about it? its not wobbling though. hey, as i updated today my bios firmware to 1.5.0 version, the usb-c on the right side stopped working. does anybody experiences same issue after update? now i have to use one of my thunderbolt port on the left side for da20 adapter. hello! i\\'m debating myself to buy a laptop for university and this laptop checks all the performance categories that i will likely use and will not use but, how future proof is it? and can you guys tell me all the problems that you have faced with this device since splurging 2400 dollars is not a joke and certainly i cant handle a repair in the middle of the semester so thoughts guys also i\\'m buying a 17 inch xps 9720 i9 12900 rtx 3060 16gb ram 1tb uhd+ with touchscreen note: if anyone has purchased dell refurbished outlet devices, kindly tell me long term if problems appeared because i know short time it seems perfect and flawless view poll might help those who are reporting issues with performance. hey, i\\'ll try my best to describe my question in english: i bought the xps 13 9305 recently, it\\'s got two thunderbolt 4 ports and one usb c 3.2 port. i can charge it through all of the usb c ports at the same speed with the original 65 watt powerbrick. however, in the userguide, its says to only plug the charger in the left one of the two thunderbolt 4 ports because it\\'s \"the primary thunderbolt port\" whatever that means. is that a mistake on their side? i asked a dell technician through chat but he doesn\\'t seem to understand the problem as he is constantly talking about the 5v/3a power delivery capabilities of all three ports. affiliate linked crap it looks like it finally happenend - for the love of god i cannot remember the bios/boot password. dell website just says to get in contact with them, but thats not really an option for me. is there a way to reset the bios pasword? my keyboard gets way too hot while typing on it causing me to have to take breaks. i use a 3 fan system underneath it, which only delays the temp rising to unusable levels for 30 minutes or so. i tried contacting support despite so many unbelievably bad experiences. no surprises there. despite contacting them from within my computer\\'s support assist app, he asks me to find a bunch of random order information to confirm my account forcing me to dig through my email to find. he then doesn\\'t ask me anything about my issue, but rather has me a run a full system test that takes over 3 hours with no end in sight. at this point, i couldn\\'t take any more time off work so i had to cancel it and just deal with it. i figured that even with the test results, he would probably just have me send it in or try something stupid like resetting it before trying anything else. i wanted to see if anyone had a similar issue or had some ideas on what to try? i bought the 9510 about a month ago and the right speakers caused a loud rattling in the far right keys even at low volume say around 30. they sent me a brand new one so all was good. now the new one is having the same problems but worse rattling/vibrating and also now the hinge makes a noise like it\\'s rubbing against something wrong half the time when you close it. am on the phone with them again now and extremely disappointed. \\u200b i\\'m a big dell fan and this is not acceptable. i\\'ve read quality control was an issue, and maybe i\\'m just getting unlucky, but at this point, i feel like i deserve some sort of compensation or extras for my inconveniences. hello! i\\'m debating myself to buy a laptop for university and this laptop checks all the performance categories that i will likely use and will not use but, how future proof is it? and can you guys tell me

time it seems perfect and flawless view poll i am hoping to get updated information on fan cooling options for the dell 8950. reading many posts on the dell community forum and here on reddit, as well as watching available youtube videos, i am at a loss to find consensus on just a few basic points regarding options that work. plus, i am wondering now that many of those posts/videos are over 6 months old, what are people experiencing after making their various cooling mods. my use case: - dell 8950 - intel i7-12700 - stock cooler- used for image and video post-processing, ms office, browsing, maybe some gaming looking for: - better fan cooling - no bios errors - quiet operation - easy installation be quiet, noctua, arctic, vetroo, dell (k-version cooler), and more, are all possibilities. but, some throw bios errors, others are not really rated for 12700 peak heat, some come with all needed hardware, others don\\'t. if you added a better fan cooler to your 8950, it can handle peak heat, it doesn\\'t throw errors, and there are no issues/gotchas months later, please weigh-in! would be great for everyone looking to do this mod now and, in the future, to have an updated, and clear picture of the options. thanks for helping! has anyone encounter this weird issue where the laptop goes to sleep because the battery seems to get disconnected even though the laptop is plugged in? i have even set power management to never sleep. i get a kernel-power event id 524 followed by 42. with the sleep reason being battery. this happens when plugged in. and when it\\'s not. i have tried looking online and can\\'t seem to find anything. i am eying the xps 8950 but i am wondering if there will be a newel model released in the near future? hello, i\\'m i the only one who have a 2h battery life on my dell xps 17 9710 ( i7 4k rtx 3060) it is an issue related to windows 11 ? does anyone have the same issue at least for windows 10? i was looking for the dell xps 13 plus at best buy online today and noticed that they don\\'t have the webpage linked or valid url anymore. did they recall and remove the model? any updates from anyone else. i usually leave my xps connected to the thunderbolt connection to the dock that connects to two monitors when i put it to sleep. when i wake, i want the monitors to wake too, but that\\'s not happening and the xps is not detecting them. i have to take the thunderbolt connection out and plug it back in for the monitors to wake. any suggestions? i have tried looking online and can\\'t seem to find anything. i am eying the xps 8950 but i am wondering if there will be a newel model released in the near future? it still wobbles or rattles? it is uneven? i\\'m asking that because from what i\\'ve seen they changed the design of the trackpad completely compared to the 9500 and 9510. https://preview.redd.it/wdc52jsab5j91.jpg?width=2913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd9528d118a7c2428e5329b454249ec7b17b886e 9510 won\\'t connect to external monitors through dock on startup. have to unplug and replug the usb-c thunderbolt connection. i usually leave my xps connected to the thunderbolt connection to the dock that connects to two monitors when i put it to sleep. when i wake, i want the monitors to wake too, but that\\'s not happening and the xps is not detecting them. i have to take the thunderbolt connection out and plug it back in for the monitors to wake. any suggestions? i have a wd19tbs dock connected to a dell xps 15 9510 and ethernet plug is in use. however, it rarely works and keeps going to wifi instead. after wrecking my head and updating everything under the sun including: realtek drivers, dock drivers, dell drivers, intel drivers. i found the solution to uninstall the realtek usb gbe ethernet controller driver from device manager, restart windows 11 and let it use this driver: realtek usb gbe ethernet controller driver 26/09/2015 10.38.117.2020 this, strangely enough works. but as soon as i run windows update, it updates to this driver version: realtek usb gbe ethernet controller driver 19/04/2022 1153.6.418.2022 which immediately breaks ethernet connection, even after a restart, unplug / plug, flushing dns etc, hours of things tried. and only uninstalling the realtek usb gbe ethernet controller driver and restarting laptop to get it back to 2015 version gets it working again! does anyone know anything about this? is it a botched realtek driver or a botched dell driver? anything i can do here? this is a bit inconvenient as windows update doesn\\'t offer me the option to get this driver update and automatically applies it, so every windows update my ethernet breaks again. hey all. i came across a few comments on reddit where people have flashed their rtx 3050 ti to allow a slight increase in power draw from 40/45w to 50/55w in their 9510 or 9520s. the bios linked in said comments is linked here. i tried flashing this bios using nvidia nvflash; disable gpu in device manager, get bios backup, flash new bios and restart. the first \\'issue\\' is that i get a id mismatch prompt. i\\'m not entirely sure is actually an issue or if it is normal; just didn\\'t see it mentioned in those comments i mentioned earlier. i continue the flashing process and restart my computer. during the restart i get a prompt from windows to enter my bitlocker key, i am also not sure if this is normal but i thought it would be good to mention. once i get in windows i enable the 3050 ti again in device manager. now i don\\'t think there\\'s an actual way to verify if the flashing is successful. i went to check gpu z and noticed the device id is still the \\'base\\' id from the earlier id mismatch prompt, and not the one it was warning me about. if i start the flashing process again in nvflash it also gives the same id mismatch prompt again. i am not sure if this points to an unsuccessful flash, or that the id just doesn\\'t change during a bios flash and is tied to hardware? anyhow, i was hoping someone who has flashed their 3050 ti bios in their 95xx before could give me some insight, since i couldn\\'t find that much info on it. hello! bit of a bizarre issue here! i use a dell wd19/k20a001 dock with a 2021 dell xps 13 9310. i don\\'t notice any issues with performance or devices connected to the dock, and everything works completely fine when i use it with ubuntu. however, when the laptop is connected to the dock and asleep in windows, the laptop overheats to the point of shutting down. it doesn\\'t occur while i\\'m using it. i have noticed that the display light on the dock begins to flash randomly (approximately a couple of times per second). it doesn\\'t seem to happen while the laptop is charging, only while it is fully charged. no other devices can charge from the dock when this is happening. to prevent thermal damage to my device, i\\'ve just been rebooting into ubuntu or unplugging it when i\\'m not using it, but this is obviously a bit inconvenient. i get the sense this might be a windows issue, but since it involves two dell devices, i thought i\\'d ask here first! i apologize if this was already discussed. i noticed some posts. but does anyone know, for sure, that touch pens don\\'t work with this computer? or does someone know which one does work? thank you so i\\'ve had my xps 15 9520 for about two months and i love it! battery life is great for me, i do try to keep my screen brightness down to help with that. i use it for work, mostly remoting in to my work desktop but also working on some marketing designs and other office work. personally i use it for pretty much everything else but gaming. i also added more ram (64gb crucial) and storage (2tb samsung 980 pro) myself. it was very easy, though i did have to buy a heatsink. no trackpad issues. everything worked outside of the box. it\\'s light and feels well built. facial recognition to sign in is fast and useful. i think it\\'s great for a work laptop (though mine is definitely overpowered). i also like how cold the laptop feels when i turn it on after it being off for a while. i have not had any thermal issues and it\\'s quiet enough for the work that i do. i\\'m planning on testing out civilization vi and maybe overwatch on it. i\\'m also searching for a good skin, but can\\'t decide on the color or pattern yet. \\u200b specs: xps 15 9520, 64gb ram, 2 tb and 512 gb ssd, fhd+ with no touch screen. my trackpad has problems, is it covered under warranty and how do they fix it give me a new unit or repair this unit? hey, i just noticed that ultra performance mode takes centuries to even start the fans, after finishing a full benchmark, and of course throttling at 100% cpu, the fans just started kicking in, but changing to cool immidiatelly gave them a huge boost. i\\'m on xps 15 9510. the description of the mode states that fans should be faster on ultra performance, but because of how long they take to even start and the thermal throttling, cool mode has better benchmark scores than ultra performance... i contacted the support and after like an hour of installing updates and debugging they decided that it\\'s how it\\'s supposed to work. is there any way to manually controll the fans / fix this, or am i stuck with terrible thermal managment? if only cool mode didn\\'t throttle performance and just focused on the fans, it would be perfect... \\u200b thanks! i\\'m debating between getting the 1200p fhd+ vs. the 3.5k oled for college, mostly because i\\'m worried the extra resolution would drain the battery too quickly. anybody know how many hours the 3.5k model would get doing typical college work (web browsing, word processor, occasional video viewing, etc.) with ~50% brightness? honestly anything above 6-8 hours would be excellent for me. i\\'ll be doing anything heavy in my room with the charger connected so that\\'s not a concern. currently i’m using xps 15 7590 that comes with 32 gb out of box and will give this to my wife bought a xps 17 9710 16gb. is it possible to switch ram from 7590 and move to 9710? both of them using ddr 4 ram thanks i recently got my new xps 15 and decided to try out some games, and i noticed in certain games like league of legends that my fps is capped at 30. my in-game settings says fps is uncapped, and i tried looking for help online but nothing worked. does the xps 9520 have a camera cover for the front camera? also does the camera allow for face id with windows hello? hi, i\\'ve been following several posts on this subreddit re. video stuttering on various xps models. i think i might have a solution but first i\\'ll describe the problem i\\'m trying to solve so there is less confusion about what it is i\\'m posting about. \\u200b igpu is being used for playback (intel iris xe) latest xe drivers from dell are installed near latest bios installed (1.4.0) mostly used on ac power machine is not rebooted for many days after several sleep/wake cycles, the playback of videos, especially uhd/hdr videos, is choppy with lots of stuttering inspection in task manager shows the video decode graph showing high usage inspection of igpu clock rates (using software such as hwinfo or gpu-z) shows that it\\'s never going above 100mhz (the default/idle rate) when it should be going up to rates like 1400mhz when decoding uhd video; it\\'s believed that this failure to use higher clock rates is causing the video to fail to decode in a timely manner which in turn produces the stuttering now there are other posts describing this issue and discussing solutions such as a clean install and then installing dell\\'s drivers but not installing the my dell app, but instead installing the older dell power manager. it\\'s unclear to me whether this solution is a success. \\u200b instead, i investigated the my dell app. it turns out that it\\'s built on top of a windows service that dell ships with the my dell app called fusion. when you launch the my dell app, it talks to the fusion service to get system information. \\u200b now my possible solution is simple: stop the fusion service, disable it in the services management console (services.msc), and then reboot. \\u200b i\\'ve been using my xps for many days now and the stuttering no longer occurs on it. a week or so ago i had to change my power settings using my dell so i re-enabled the fusion service, made my change and then left the service running. a day or so later, the stuttering returned. i then disabled the fusion service again, rebooted the machine, and so far it\\'s been good (no stuttering). \\u200b if i had to guess, i\\'d say that when the machine wakes from sleep, the fusion service is setting (or not setting) the igpu clock rates correctly (or rather, it\\'s not enabling the clock rates to ramp up if needed but instead is locking the rate to 100mhz). if this is the case, disabling the service prevents it from messing up the clock rate locking. this is just a wild guess though. \\u200b now i don\\'t promise this is a working solution. i\\'m just stating that it appears to stop the stuttering from occurring on my machine. it might not be successful on yours. \\u200b anyway, i hope this helps. please let me know if you have any luck with this possible solution. \\u200b thanks for reading. hey everyone, \\u200b i\\'ve been trying to get a new laptop for quite some time and as we all know, we get caught up in the specs sometime. well, anyway, my laptop was supposed to be used to do video editing on the go and at work. i also have a desktop at home which i can transfer back and forth to do some more heavy lifting if needed. \\u200b so this brings me to my selections, i ended up going with the xps 15 for the graphics card and the slimness. decided at first to get a fhd+ i7 model with 16gb and 512. it runs great and lasted me throughout my work day which is a ten hour day on light duty. i decided i can sacrifice some more battery and go for the oled and sprung for the i9. with the 1tb and 32gb of ram. \\u200b i will tell you this - it has been a headache the entire time since i started it up. i\\'d get the bsod during initial startup for power failure. then the computer restarts and then the trackpad freezes. when that happens the touch screen no longer works. i figured that it just needed some updates, so after updating, same issue would arise repeatedly. i would then restart the computer and it would fix itself. i would navigate the computer by just using the keyboard to reset the laptop to try and fix the issue. i can\\'t believe that i am having so many issues with the laptop right out of the box. i can see why people like macs. it just works right outside of the box with little fanfare. i just like using windows and its just so damn hard to find good quality laptops that makes little sacrifices. \\u200b i know mac are slow on implementing things and charge higher prices, but when they execute the product, they definitely execute it well. i really like the xps because it\\'s upgradeable, but the i9 is just riddled with issues right out of the box. sorry for the rant. this sounds like a driver/os issue. i wonder if the ubuntu version is free from these problems (popping audio, stuttering video, etc.) i have had this laptop for about 2 weeks and have taken it on holiday, and now the capacitive touch buttons are not working. they just do not react at all to any input. i have restarted the device, tried all the support assist stuff. how do i get it to work again? i really damn need those escape and delete keys. edit: nvm bios update fixed it since i’ve received the xps 9520, it makes a cracking noise when i pick it up with the lid open. it seems like the chassis is flexing a bit and may be a physical integrity issue. is this happening to anyone else? i had no issues with my 9560 and it felt very solid. does anyone know the process for installing the proper drivers for the dell xps 13 plus with ubuntu 22.04? i installed ubuntu before dell announced proper support and i am wondering if there is a way to install the software for this version of ubuntu? i\\'m having a couple of problems with my xps 13 plus, under arch linux, that i\\'d really like to solve 1) the microphone. it appears to not be working correctly. it is seen by the system, but all that comes out is just a fuzzy noise (according to the arch wiki, it should work out of the box). should i try to get a replacement? i sadly didn\\'t test if it worked on ubuntu (that it came preinstalled with). 2) hibernation. i enabled hibernation on a 16 gib swap file, and it technically works. just, it doesn\\'t power off. let me try to describe this behaivour: when i call systemctl hibernate the screen stays off for a second, turns off for half a secons, then turns on again and supposedly the system should power off after some time. instead, it stays frozen indefinitely after this stage, unresponsive, and i have to turn it off by keeping the power button pressed for a while. when i turn the computer on again, i find it where i had left it, with my uptime still there, so it did hibernate. it just didn\\'t turn off after, and i suspect this might be related to the third problem. 3) power off. when i try to power the system off, e.g. using systemctl poweroff, it just hangs with a couple of the process errors related to systemd-udev not wanting to end. the issue doesn\\'t always appear, but it\\'s pretty annoying when it does. hhre\\'s a picture of it. after some more time, i see some watchdog complain popping up too. here too i have to power the system off by long-pressing the power button. it doesn\\'t always happen, but i\\'d say ~60% of the time. 4) suspension. it works perfectly fine on linux 5.19.1, it\\'s broken in 5.19.2 and 5.15 lts (which also has some other issues, as also specified in the wiki, like mics and speakers not working, but that\\'s ok since this kernel is older than the laptop itself). with \"broken\" i mean that the system doesn\\'t enter sleep. it just stays there frozen, with the screen still on, the function row stays lit and the keyboard backlighting also does (and turns on if i touch the touchpad after it turns off). i went back to 5.19.1 for the moment, i guess i\\'ll wait \\'till someone maybe has an answer or to see how it goes in 5.19.3 in a couple of weeks. has anyone experienced the same, and maybe has a solution, especially for the mic issue. please tell me, any kind of help would be vastly appreciated tldr: don\\'t buy the xps 13 plus due to qc: display gap dead pixel speaker popping occasionally fans scraping against the chassis weird clicking noise when hold at certain angles graphics driver issue high pitched coil whine (i am really sensitive to it and it hurts my ears) hi folks, typing this on the dell xps 13 plus 9320 here. i have been anticipating this laptop since i ordered it a couple of weeks ago. it finally arrived today, and despite all the problems i read on reddit and online, i had hoped the majority of these issues were fixable through software, i.e., reinstalling windows from ufd, or that quality control issues were of the minority. alas, this is not the case, as i will most likely send it back as soon as possible. the xps 13 plus is a clean and minimalist laptop, and its design is amazing. however, this is really just a wolf in sheep\\'s skin as i and others have encountered numerous issues. first of all, the display. i had heard of about 3 instances of the new xps 13 laptops, including the 9320 and 9315, having weird gap issues or adhesive problems with the panel. unfortunately, my unit does have this issue, though it is not as extreme as the screen falling off at best buy. the corner seems to move when pressed as if there is no glue around the screen to secure it, and when moving to a dark room, you can see the display\\'s backlight seeping through the small gap where it isn\\'t properly glued together. also, i bought the non-touch matte panel, and it looks like the edges of the coating weren\\'t applied properly; there seems to be a bit of an air bubble or something at the very edges of the film, i guess you could say. there\\'s a dead pixel on the display too, which is disappointing from dell. second, audio. i noticed during the initial setup that there were popping sounds from the speakers. after the first oobe setup and booting into windows, i immediately completely ufd reinstalled it without traces of the dell image from before. i found this issue to still occur after stopping audio playback in some cases. performance is fantastic for the 13-inch ultrabook it is. (by the way, i am not getting any of the 0.4ghz throttling issues as others have reported, this is likely because of the ufd reinstall i performed). the i5 1240p model can sustain 35w @ 2.3ghz, in cinebench r23. it consistently scored 9200-9300 sustained for some time; however, after about 17 runs, it throttles down to 28w and fluctuates between the upper and lower 8000s. this, of course, comes at the cost of extreme heat. it gets hot on the bottom of the laptop, and you wouldn\\'t want to put that on your lap. though, the heat felt on the keyboard deck is much more manageable and gets warm but not as bad as the bottom casing. during the 25 runs of the cinebench r23 torture test i ran the xps 13 plus through, i noticed the fans started making a weird noise. and it appears the fans were scraping along the bottom metal cover or at least against something. curious, i also tried applying pressure on the bottom cover which temporarily caused a fan to stop spinning for a second or so. this is concerning. another issue was coil whine, which i noticed a little bit, however, it was mostly quiet. what drove me to a headache was this other strange sound while running tests, high-pitched in the background of the fan noise. i wasn\\'t sure what this was exactly. maybe it was the coil whine getting worse? despite all the advertising that dell tells you about performance, the xps 13 plus is not meant to be a performance laptop, at least with long extensive workloads. short bursts of power needed are probably definitely fine on this laptop. capacitive touch function row? no problems with it, in my opinion. as a touch typist, i think the keyboard is great, and you can easily get used to it within a couple of hours of use or so. the keys don\\'t take much actuation force, and it feels like they are higher travel than they are. the trackpad is mostly good. however, i have one annoying thing with palm rejection. my hand would rest on the area where the right click would be, and clicking on the left side of the trackpad would trigger the right click. another minor caveat was slight inconsistency with how the haptics felt in different locations on the trackpad, though, i didn\\'t find it to be a big deal. after using it for a while, i don\\'t think you need any indication or markings of where the trackpad is, just like dell claims. your muscle memory will work it out. it\\'s not on par with apple\\'s macbooks which have a more satisfying click; however, this is not too far behind. build quality is pretty good in general, except for the flexing of the bottom metal cover. windows central reported on chassis flex causing the fans to scrape against the bottom, and i have also noticed this same issue (mentioned in the performance section earlier). battery life isn\\'t something i can say about yet, considering i\\'ve only used this for a couple of hours. but other people have said it isn\\'t that great due to alderlake. i want to like this laptop. honestly now, i\\'m very disappointed with this purchase. even though i got it for a cheaper price, i still pretty much regret this decision because of dell\\'s horrifying quality control. i might go out and buy the macbook air m2 in hopes of better quality assurance from apple as well as a solid build and battery life. the thinkpad z13 might be nice (if i can get myself to not care about the plastic bezels on its matte display compared to integrated bezels on the xps 13 plus), and the slim 7 pro x is also a good deal at costco right now. edit: this is an image of the display gap: https://imgur.com/a/6af1de. also getting graphics driver issues when i tried loading minecraft. the trackpad is also making random clicking noises when not touching it sometimes. there\\'s also another clicking sound when holding the laptop at some angles but i don\\'t know what is causing that. i can confirm the high-pitched noise is very likely the coil whine getting worse when pushing the laptop. very informative. my most recent experience with dell was pretty similar. last year i bought an inspiron 17 2in1 and got comparable lags while navigating internet and watching videos. i went through the same process as you; a clean install of windows. the laptop behaves better now but i can imagine the utter desperation that non-tech savy persons might feel after finding out their 1000euros machine is not performing as well as their old 10 years-old machine. that’s simply unacceptable, especially on such price ranges. thank you for being vocal about it!

i sadly didn\\'t test if it worked on ubuntu (that it came preinstalled with). 2) hibernation. i enabled hibernation on a 16 gib swap file, and it technically works. just, it doesn\\'t power off. let me try to describe this behaivour: when i call systemctl hibernate the screen stays off for a second, turns off for half a secons, then turns on again and supposedly the system should power off after some time. instead, it stays frozen indefinitely after this stage, unresponsive, and i have to turn it off by keeping the power button pressed for a while. when i turn the computer on again, i find it where i had left it, with my uptime still there, so it did hibernate. it just didn\\'t turn off after, and i suspect this might be related to the third problem. 3) power off. when i try to power the system off, e.g. using systemctl poweroff, it just hangs with a couple of the process errors related to systemd-udev not wanting to end. the issue doesn\\'t always appear, but it\\'s pretty annoying when it does. hhre\\'s a picture of it. after some more time, i see some watchdog complain popping up too. here too i have to power the system off by long-pressing the power button. it doesn\\'t always happen, but i\\'d say ~60% of the time. 4) suspension. it works perfectly fine on linux 5.19.1, it\\'s broken in 5.19.2 and 5.15 lts (which also has some other issues, as also specified in the wiki, like mics and speakers not working, but that\\'s ok since this kernel is older than the laptop itself). with \"broken\" i mean that the system doesn\\'t enter sleep. it just stays there frozen, with the screen still on, the function row stays lit and the keyboard backlighting also does (and turns on if i touch the touchpad after it turns off). i went back to 5.19.1 for the moment, i guess i\\'ll wait \\'till someone maybe has an answer or to see how it goes in 5.19.3 in a couple of weeks. has anyone experienced the same, and maybe has a solution, especially for the mic issue. please tell me, any kind of help would be vastly appreciated got a new laptop and immediately installed linux; no issues with the installation and the laptop is everything i wanted but there is one issue. the colors are too vivid for my taste and looking for the suggestions how to correct. dont get me wrong, it is not bad to the point of thinking to return the laptop. i am not a graphical designer neither i play games, but still. any suggestion is appreciated. hello! recently my charger broke so i ordered a new one from ebay. the charger says that it\\'s a 130w charger, but i receive a slow charger warning when it is plugged in. i have updated my bios to 1.12.0 which has not solved it. just wanted to ask if there is an actual fix for this or if i need to figure out if there is something wrong with the charger itself? (edit: bios says that the adaptor is providing 90w) additionally, does anybody have any information on the default drive partitions for the 9720 with a 1tb ssd? on the xps15 that i bought in 2017, the 1 tb hard drive was pre-partitioned such that c drive (default for system, app caches, etc) was only 70ish gb, which was a huge pain in the beginning. hoping to find out if i should be prepared to re-partition the drive on the 9720. hi, i connect my monitor by dp cable to dock stations but it work like old windows 95. i can\\'t even move any window smoothly. any advice? i have a new 9520. it is less than 1 week old. for the first time, i used zoom and the microphone (internal and external) were not working. i checked microphone privacy, and everything is \"on\". i had another issue with my headphones previously. the xps was recognizing the headphones but wasn\\'t playing from them. i had to uninstall and reinstall reaktek audio driver. however, now my microphone is not working. any solutions? cpu:i9 12th gen gpu: 3050ti ram: 16gb , ssd: 1tb hi, \\u200b i think that dell is trying to wear me down by attrition. \\u200b short story: ordered 3 xps desktops from dell. opened them after the 30 days grace period to find out that they would all freeze randomly. been troubleshooting with dell for 4 months. they\\'ve replaced many parts during that time. they decided to replace one pc (the one we troubleshooted) but not the other 2. they want me to start troubleshoot the other 2. bought 3 pcs. i\\'ve got 3 bricks (well now i\\'ve got 2). i\\'m exausted. \\u200b dell employees are all pre-programmed to say the same thing and obey dell\\'s policy to the letter. \\u200b what can be done to get dell to hear common sense and to start \"really\" helping me? \\u200b \\u200b long story: we\\'ve ordered 3 brand new xps 8940 with i5-11400; 8gb ram; 512gb pcie nvme; nvidia gtx 1660 super 6gb in november 2021 (on the same day). received them in january 2022. we didn\\'t need then right away. so waited in april to open the boxes and install them. out of the box they were all randomly freezing. it could take 2 hours or 7 days to happen. when they freeze, the image on the screen is freezed, the mouse cursor doesn\\'t move, we cannot ping the pcs anymore. we then need to long press the power button to shut it down. when we power it on, right after, it could be days before it freezes again. details of the troubleshooting done below*. pc passes the long dell epsa diagnostics test. \\u200b i\\'m a certified computer technician. i\\'ve opened hundreds of new pcs\\' boxes in my life. i know when something\\'s normal and when something\\'s not. \\u200b i\\'ve contacted dell customer service. theys said \"it\\'s been more than 30 day and you need to contact dell tech support\": did that. i\\'ve told them i had 3 systems with exactly the same problem. the tech on the chat said that we\\'d start with one and then, once we find a fix, we\\'d apply the fix to the other 2 pcs. i said \"alright\". \\u200b i\\'ve been starting troubleshooting with dell in april. now we\\'re in august. it\\'s been 4 months. they\\'ve sent a dell tech 2 times to replace parts. the first time he replaced the motherboard and the nvidia video card. the second time, he replaced the cpu and the power supply. each time the pc passed the long dell epsa diagnostics test. \\u200b then dell asked me to try different things. update the drivers (again). update the bios (again for the third time). try different power settings. change bios settings. in total, since the beginning, we\\'ve exchanged 80 emails back and fourth. finally, after 3 months of troubleshooting, the agent said that they would replace the xps 8940 (11th gen intel processor) by a brand new xps 8950 (12th gen processor). i said \"great! we found a fix\". i asked him if they could apply the same fix to the other 2 pcs. he said \"no. first dell will need to investigate the pc we troubleshooted when we receive it. and then we\\'ll need to troubleshoot the other 2 pcs.\" \\u200b i\\'m exhausted. \\u200b since we\\'ve received these 3 desktops in january (7 months ago), we still cannot use them because they all freeze. \\u200b i think we\\'ve already made more than a reasonable amount of troubleshooting. i mean, we\\'ve been troubleshooting since may (4 months ago; since i\\'ve opened the boxes). i think i\\'ve been more than very understanding, reasonable and patient until now. \\u200b why would dell not apply the same fix to the 2 other pcs? \\u200b we cannot wait anymore. we really need those pcs in normal working order for us to take care of our business. \\u200b that would be the least dell could do to offer good customer service to a long time good customer. we\\'ve already been waiting for too long. \\u200b i\\'ve called customer support, again (2 more times): all they do is transfering me to tech support. all they want to do is troubleshoot the other 2 pcs. they say we cannot apply the same fix to the other 2 pcs, because it could be a different problem.... yeah right! \\u200b i\\'ve tried @ dellcares on twitter. they\\'re saying the same bullshirt, ..., bullfrog, errr.. you know what i mean! they want to troubleshoot the other 2 pcs. \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b *details of troubleshooting done: tried with many monitors and different cables: same issue. did a fresh install of windows 11: same issue. updated nvidia drivers: tried the one on dell\\'s website, tried the one on nvidia website: same issue. updated bios (3 times). tried connecting the hdmi cable to the integrated intel card : it still freezes. like i said: i\\'m a certified computer technician. i\\'ve opened hundreds of new pcs\\' boxes in my life. i know when something\\'s normal and when something\\'s not. those pcs were faulty from day 1. \\u200b steps to replicate: easy: set the computer to never go to sleep and never turn off the display. go on a website with animated gifs on it (so you see something moving) wait for the animated gif, well, to stop moving. then you know the pc is frozen. i want to upgrade my current nvme micron 3400 512gb to a 1 tb nvme. should i try the samsung evo pro 980? also, should i go with raid or ahci? i plan to do a clean install of windows 11 this time around. hey guys, anyone have any experience purchasing refurbished laptops from the dell outlets? i was planning on getting the xps 13 plus but when i was about to do the payment, they told me to do a bank transfer and the bank couldn’t recognise the bank account they provided. it just states that the recipient is “anonymous” which sounds a little sceptical to me. i asked for some reassurance or anything like that and all the person replied with was “‘no.” so i was hoping to get some advice from here. thanks! i got used to it and now love it. give it a day or two. when a sound is supposed to be playing but the speakers are muted the speakers make a buzzing sound. this happens with anything that plays a sound such as youtube videos or system sounds. as soon as you mute the video you are watching by pressing \"m\" the buzzing sound goes away, unmuting the video will make the buzzing sound come back. i\\'ve searched around on the dell forums and people said it has been a driver issue since the xps 15 9500 launched but non of the forum threads offered a solution. edit: i am currently on the latest realtek audio driver (6.0.9261.1_a08) my 9520 is beyond ridiculous at this point, i upgraded from my 9510 and all i’ve gotten is worse performance and battery life. for example, i used to be able to run forza horizon 5 at 1440p (1600p) at a mix of high to ultra settings and always get a solid 60fps. the same applies to horizon 4, gta v/gta online etc. just good performance all round with great battery life on my 9510. ever since getting the 9520, i’ve nothing but issues. dell customer service is a bunch of bullshit, they seem to think the system running the fans at max speed and having the under side burning hot doing nothing is “normal” when my 9510 didn’t do that whatsoever. i had a 9500 originally back in 2020, then upgraded to the 9510 in 2021, and then again to the 9520 this year. i’ve since moved my windows installation from my 9500 to both my 9510 and 9520. going from 9500 to 9510 was no issues, just a few drivers and that’s all. no issues. the same applied for my 9520 except more drivers needed to be replaced/installed, so i did that. this is where problems started. initially, it was fine. but then after a day or two, i noticed just booting up the system made the entire underside very hot with the fans running at full speed. naturally, i thought it was my windows install that was causing it. for context, i was running windows 11 22h2 which was upgraded from og windows 11 from windows 10. so i decided to reinstall a fresh copy of windows 11 22h2. i wiped my drive and reinstalled and i thought it was fixed as for the first few days it was great. no issues at all. until the 3rd day came about, and it started doing this shit all over again. the system has all latest drivers, bios and windows update’s, the same applied to my previous install of windows. can anyone help? i7 12700h, oled, 16gb, two 1tb drives not in raid, 3050ti ive just set up dual boot windows 11 / kubuntu 22.04 and i have this weird issue on linux: when computer screen turns off, it doesnt come back on. the pc is running, as if i blindly launch terminal and issue reboot cmd it executes. so its just the screen issue. gets weirder. it happens if i use quick keys (on top) to lower brightness. kubuntu allows to lower all the way to 0%. at that point it turns off monitor. and i cant turn it back on even if i immediately press brightness+ button. however if i use brightness controls from tray and use arrow keys to move slider to 0 and then back up, this works fine. on windows you cannot turn brightness with quick keys to 0, but i tested at least power saving screen off and was able to get it back up then with moving mouse. i have tried multiple kernels (5.15 and 5.19), i have latest bios 1.6.0, latest drivers. any ides? thanks! my pretty new xps 15 windows 11 is stuttering a bit on youtube videos... any ideas why? it\\'s playing videos worse than my work dell latitude with 11th gen intel, windows 10, integrated gpu a new bios 1.5.0 is out for dell xps 9520 (and its siblings). latency still at 1200us, with the worst offender being the acpi.sys dpc routine. audio plays pretty well testing with youtube and spotify, stopping and starting them in turn. my 9520 is beyond ridiculous at this point, i upgraded from my 9510 and all i’ve gotten is worse performance and battery life. for example, i used to be able to run forza

reinstalled a cloud version of windows 11 so i think the overheating is fine now (time will tell). for some reason though, the gpu is underperforming everywhere, even though it\\'s being used. i tested metal gear solid 5, a 7 year old game and initially it was okay, gpu utilization was 40% and the fps was capped at the max the game allows (60), but then the gpu usage went up to 100% and the frame rate dropped to 35-40, which makes no sense. i have a 3050ti/i7-11800h, so i doubt that it\\'s something it can\\'t handle. i just want it to be the way it was when i first loaded up the game (40% @/60fps). i\\'m not gonna be gaming on this thing but i need the gpu utilization for cad and some other gpu intensive stuff. if anyone knows a fix i\\'d really appreciate it :d hey guys, i’ve just received my xps 17 9720. i have the i9, 4k, 32gb ram and rtx 3060 version. i read a lot of reviews about the pc and many said it lasted more than 6 hours which is completely fine for me. when i first used it, it only lasted 2h40. i then tested it multiple times and whether the battery saving mode is activated or not, i always get 2h40 minutes of battery life. contacted dell support and they told me the battery life for my model should last at least 5-6 hours. they offered a replacement or a refund. from what i’ve seen on many websites and on this subreddit, this problem seems pretty common. should i get a replacement or the low battery life is a common problem with that specific model? thank you very much! i just got an xps 15 9510. i was doing some testing and i\\'ve already

knows a fix i\\'d really appreciate it :d hi all, i recently purchased my xps 9510 i9, 32 gb ram, 3050ti laptop and am in need for a docking station. i dont necessarily need a thunderbolt 4 dock, just something with ethernet, some usb a ports, a couple display ports, and mainly, a dock that can deliver 130w of pd to my machine. does anybody have experience using the wd15 with the xps 9510? any pd issues or overall compatibility issues? the wd15 is going for more than half the price of the tb4 docks, and has all the ports that i need for my use case and setup. would really love to save the extra money on this dock. thanks! good mornig, i noticed some small oddities in the total power of the system, using hwinf64. it happens that the total power of the system is twice as much in some cases, instead being 10,000 w (which is normal) is 20,000 w for no reason, without applications in use, when the pc is restarted; waiting a few minutes the situation does not change (for the moment i noticed this when it is disconnected from the power cord). to change this problem i have to \"reset\" the pc: once windows restarts, i wait a few moments for the system to do its things, and it returns to 10,000, and therefore power consumption, fan noise and battery life are at the top. i have had the laptop for about ten days. have you checked this aspect on your xps? spec: xps 9720, i9 12900hk, 64gb ram, nvidia geforce 3060 https://preview.redd.it/amgnotda5yh91.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d3be52df0d45a97d24a6ae845c0b5542c581c38 good morning. these are the first times i hear about egpu. do you think it would be possible to connect a graphics card like the nvidia a4500 or a5500 (16 gb) externally? a graphics card that needs many watts and twice as many gb, would have its own external power supply, is that correct? it is xps 17 9720 12900hk 64 gb ram with nvidia geforce rtx 3060 (6 gb 60 watt) to which the new graphics card would be connected. the nvidia a4500/a5500 is a graphic card certified by autodesk for autocad, revit, etc. thank you. 💖 tldr - win11 bitlocked, no key was ever setup. laptop re-installed and data lost. i guess this is just sharing a story that others will probably have. i bought a xps 13 9305 for a really good price for the wife. great laptop, epic hardware that should last many os/generations. it came with windows 11 which i ultimately cleaned off the junk ( but should have wiped and re-installed it.. the device when booted ( probably after an update ) presented my wife with a bitlocker unlock screen. i thought that was very odd since we never set that up. trying all the options, various articles to no luck. the drive doesn\\'t report that its encrypted and the various debug tools state is wasn\\'t encrypted, but the state of things was all <unknown>. toggling secure boot from on/off and various settings there was no luck. i cloned the drive, tried the drive in my deskop all presenting bitlocker recovery screen. the microsoft account we did use also has no bitblocker recovery keys. it\\'s also good to note that this is windows 11 home, there\\'s no encryption ( i know the stuff is there, but its hidden behind licensing ). somewhere in an update ( probably microsoft ) that a driver or firmware thing has changed, but hasn\\'t triggered the various tpm stuff most big changes do. no idea who to blame, but its a shitty experience. we lost a few low-key docs we needed, but not a big deal, most things were saved to google drive. i\\'ve been waiting to jump to linux, and just re-installed with popos 22.02 and its worked flawlessly so far. the wife thinks its easier and better to use than windows 11 too. most 9-11th gen dell\\'s just run very hot and throttle like hell unplugged saves battery by lowering speed, thus temps too i just got an xps 15 9510. i was doing some testing and i\\'ve already seen a lot of overheating and battery issues. i\\'ve reinstalled a cloud version of windows 11 so i think

works like a charm on ubuntu 22.04.1 (except the camera/webcam, which is still missing drivers for 22.04+), but since the laptop has only 2 usb c ports, i\\'m using it with an anker adaptor to expand its connectivity. this particular one has power pass-through capabilities, so i am charging my xps through the adaptor. now, i have been using anker products for years, so i\\'m not too worried, but the bios warned me the system may not perform as well as intended with this power pass-through adaptor. most of the times, i\\'m not doing anything power-intensive with my xps, so i\\'m not worried about that. however, i keep my xps connected to ac most of the time, so i\\'m wondering if constantly charging it via a power pass-through adaptor (that is not manufactured by dell) may contribute to the quicker degradation of my battery. any thoughts? thanks very much in advance! what the heck am i doing wrong? or i am getting really unlucky with these touchpads? i\\'ve gotten it replaced once already but i\\'m just making sure that this isn\\'t something that i\\'m doing that can be avoided. so. it keeps getting stuck (unable to press down to click) and i need to bend the laptop a bit for it to pop back out... half the time it doesn\\'t click at all and the mouse acts like it\\'s being pressed down causing a bunch of on screen issues. anyone else have this problem/how to resolve it? when i had it replaced it was working perfectly however it\\'s now again doing what the first one did.. hey all tossing up between i5/i7 model, will be used for mainly office productivity and will mostly plugged into power and running 24 hours a day. also any feedback between the two colours? platinum vs graphite? does the graphite wear awayt to anyones knowledge? cheers i bought a used xps 15 9500 and am thinking of returning it and getting a used xps 13 9310 (i7, 16gb ram) due to the lack of hdr output due to the displayport 1.2 limitation. here\\'s the thing, i don\\'t trust the \"it can handle it\" mentality because let\\'s be honest, the 4k displays on windows laptops are laggy as fuck with choppy animations and definitely not the advertised standard 60 frames per second. question

potential issues i may get upgrading. i saw that it\\'s 22.04 certified now and they now also ship with 22.04 pre-installed, so i was wondering if i could upgrade my machine to the new lts release as well. thanks in advance! just got the 9520 and was ready to install 64 ram and 2 tb ssd. i stripped two screws and had to go to the extractor. this worked for one screw. the second hole was off center and the extractor wouldn\\'t bite. now it\\'s too deep and has likely melded the screw into the case or the threaded hole. i\\'m thinking i should stop at this point before it gets any worse. not sure what to do here. i think the screw will have to be drilled right out leaving a hole and an ugly mess. so disappointed that i messed this up on a brand new laptop. i\\'m wondering if i should contact dell at this point. i have the upgraded coverage. any ideas? hello again, everyone. i recently got a dell xps 13 plus 9320 (16gb ram, i7-1260-p processor). this morning, i turned on my laptop at 85%, and 2.5 hours later, it went down to 19%. as for the charging time, it has taken 4-6 hours to fully charge. what can i do to fix this? it\\'s almost as if it\\'s opposing what was advertised lol. does anyone know if the standard t-slot kensignton lock will work for my brand new dell xps 15 9510? i\\'m pretty sure it will but am not 100% sure as i\\'ve heard that some dell models have different wedge-shaped slots. looking to get either that or the xps 13 plus. xps 13 plus seems to have a lot of issues, how is the regular xps 13? just ordered my xps 8950, no liquid cooling option available as dell is out of parts. can\\'t find a list of compatible liquid cooling options - any suggestions for this upgrade? thanks, carlo i got 9520 last week, i9, 16g, oled, 3050 ti. when playing netflix or youtube or any video in 4k, the video starts lagging the voice. has anyone experience this and what is the possible solution? thanks guys. \\u200b update: its all video not just 4k, its not just lag, its absolutely total slowdown. like 5 fps stuff. looking to get one but i am concerned about the battery life. how is it? looking at the xps 9315 13 compared to the 2022 spectre x360 13.5 inch and i\\'m not really seeing any reasons to buy the xps? the hp has a 3:2 screen, cheaper for the same specs, better port selection, and a touch screen. am i missing anything? is build quality different? if i\\'m speccing out both machines the same and the hp is cheaper, why should i go for the xps? i realize the video card on the xps 13 doesn\\'t have the ram necessary to run mfs but has anyone tried it??? with what results?? looking to get an egpu for the xps 9520. does anyone have any experience using an egpu with an xps 15? some sources say you lose around 20% performance compared to a regular desktop gpu. i currently have an 11th generation 9310 2in1. but am eyeing up the new plus model with uhd, fully specced up with the 1280. i am hearing a few risks.. primary one being the overheating under routine loads. i am now pausing. i appreciate that in forums often you only hear the issues and not the good news. just trying to gauge perspectives from some owners. thanks xps 9520 12th gen i7 rtx 3050 32gb ram 4k uhd display i have this laptop connected directly via hdmi to a 50\" 4k display, and the input mouse lag is horrible. borderline unusable. this display prefs are set at 4k60fps. the mouse is a logitech mx master 3. there is zero mouse lag on the integrated display when i move to it (the external monitor is running as an extended display). i have another pc with a 3080 on this display as well that exhibits no such lag. any suggestions? i\\'m pretty sure it\\'s because the laptop is forcing intel graphics to render the external display, and not doing it well. i really with we could force the dgpu on these. i do photo processing (e.g. topaz ai), some video and audio editing on a 5-year-old laptop that gets quite hot, and slow, when doing this work. been watching the dell site for a workstation, and i might have to wait until labor day to get a good deal. we\\'ll see. got a question about my specific build... i am currently looking at a 8950 with a i7-12700k, 3060ti, 750w ps and liquid cooling. here are my questions: - is this overkill for the work i am doing? - does the k version require liquid cooling? - if a standard 12700 processor would fit the bill, would the 460w ps and no additional cooling work well? thanks in advance for your thoughts! hey;) are there any programmers/ \"heavy\" multi users with the new xps 13 (9315, i7-1250u and 16gb)? maybe someone can tell me if it\\'s suitable for programming/ university work and occasionally light gaming (osrs)? pretty much only worried about cpu and graphics performance and im having a really hard time deciding between the xps 13 and (i know not dell, sorry) the asus zenbook s 13... 😬 thanks for your time and opinions 😊 looking for a dongle for my 9520. can\\'t find and great reviews or recent articles. wan show actually mentioned that there aren\\'t any great resources for em last friday. need: ethernet port, some usba\\'s (2 or 3) nice to have- thunderbolt 4 speeds (i know, a pipe dream with that $50), display port hi everyone, i reinstalled (offical dell method) my xps 9520 and since then ive had a random issue where when the laptop has been closed (assuming sleep?) for extended period of time (over night but not always that long) rather than immediately the windows hello login screen popping up, i get the dell logo and circles spinning below it and only after than the windows hello login screen, adding an additional 4 secs more or less to my login. has anyone else encountered this before? is it a hibernation issue? \\u200b thanks in advance video playback at youtube edge browser (chrome is\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\xadeven worse) gets constantly dropped frames with 4k hdr 60 fps. intel gpu is under 80% load and its laggy as hell partially. especially in full sceen mode. hdr in windows was turned on but the laggyness also appeared with full hd in youtube. wtf. my smartphone next to it in the same network had zero dropped frames with hdr and 4k. so a smartphone is more powerful than this i7?? or is it an issue the drivers of the killer wifi module maybe? can someone of you test this as well? i have the 9510 with 16gb ram, 1tb, 4k display. see below the video i made. ps: in chrome it was even more laggy. the laptops has the latest software and bios. so this cant be the issue. https://youtu.be/jodrb6sjtk4 hey guys, i\\'m planning on buying an xps 15 but i\\'m struggling to understand which prices are fair for each generation. this https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/xps-15/spd/xps-15-9510-laptop dell xps 15 laptop seems like a steal. even though the base specs are the only options, its all i really need, and the price seems amazing... i7, 16gb ram, 3050ti and 512 gb ssd for $1600? is this as good of a price as i think? compared to the \"new\" xps 15 which is $400 more for practically the same specs. https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/new-xps-15/spd/xps-15-9520-laptop/xn9520cto030s. is the 12th gen processor really that much better? and is it the only notable difference? i am trying not to spend too much on this laptop, so do you guys think that i should just stick with the xps 15 rather than the new 12 gen processor one? and are there any other alternatives to the xps 15 that might be an even better deal? thank you for the help. does anyone know where to get either skins/hardcover case/keyboard cover for this laptop? everything i see is either for 13” xps, inspiron, or macbooks. hey guys, i\\'m trying to embed the xps 15 9520 into our client management environment. for that i need a driverpack. i couldn\\'t find one for win10, only one for win11. am i right to assume that it hasn\\'t been released yet? i am a mostly happy owner of an i7 1280p, 4k xps 13 plus. ever since i received it, it\\'s been having a substantial throttling issue where the cpu throttles to 0.4ghz as long as the speakers are turned on. it doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re watching a movie on netflix, youtube, playing a game on loud or working on spreadsheets with spotify running in the background. the device throttles, but as soon as you mute the speakers, or connect to a bluetooth device, the cpu boosts back to normal speeds again. you can repeat the cycle infinitely. it\\'s neither a heat nor any workload related issue. i have a cleaninstall of windows 11 and i\\'ve tried deleting and reinstalling the audio drivers multiple times, but to no avail. i know that a lot of you have been having this same very frustrating issue, and i wanted to ask if any of you have found a fix or workaround to it? or are there any updates from dell in regards to this issue? i\\'ve been in contact with support, but they only offer a replacement, and i\\'m quite sure i\\'ll end up with the same issue yet again. i would be incredibly thankful for any feedback/replies. hello everyone. my xps 15 9520 suddenly isn\\'t giving out any volume. i maxed it to 100%, uninstalled the device through device manager, restarted the laptop, checked bios and volume/speakers are turned on, ran support assist diagnostic and no issues found, ran the default windows troubleshooting and no issues, did windows updates and nothing to update. any help is appreciated. when i plug my new xps 9520 to my external monitor through usb-c, it starts charging the laptop but at a slow speed (the monitor max out output at 65watt). my question is, can i plug in the dell provided 130watt charger also, afraid to do so cos this will mean two power supply to the laptop. please help if you have any info. i\\'ve been having issues with bluetooth connected speakers on my xps losing audio out when another application on the pc starts using audio. for example, if i have a youtube video playing on one tab of firefox and simply click on the spotify app, the sound from the youtube video completely stops playing. if i refocus the firefox tab it will start playing again. this has mainly been an issue in meetings and conference calls, where i\\'ll be scrolling through a page and an ad or something grabs my audio and i lose my audio in microsoft teams. this one requires leaving and re-joining the meeting. anyone have similar experiences with bluetooth? i\\'d have to buy a bigger usb-c hub to connect my speakers via usb, right now they\\'re connected via bluetooth just to keep my setup clean. i recently got an xps 15 9520 refurbished with the oled panel. however, from the first day, i noticed my colors were washed out in many conditions. there were many things i found online, but none of those worked or were applicable, so here\\'s how i fixed it for future reference. let me know if there\\'s another or a better way: 1. turn off hdr initially, i turned hdr on to try it out, maybe it would make things look better; the screen supported it, so why not try. however, for my normal non-hardcore-photo-editor uses, all it did was make the screen blank out for a second when the charger was plugged in and make the colors look washed out. dell support also acknowledges this as a \"solution\" here. 2. set srgb as default profile turning off hdr solved the system-wide problem, however it still seemed like many apps (discord, firefox top bar, vscode) still seemed washed out. after going down many forum rabbit holes, i think i fixed it. go to start menu->search and click \"color management\". then click add->\"srgb iec61966-2.1\". then click on the color profile you just added and press \"set as default profile\" in the bottom right. then reopen apps to make the changes take effect. things that seemed to work: 1. turning off hardware acceleration when i was in the process of troubleshooting, a certain forum rabbit hole (i forgot exactly where) suggested this. turning off hardware acceleration in apps seemed to fix it, but it\\'s a bit tedious doing this on every app that you install. this also led me to another solution through more searching: 2. force srgb in every app if an app supports it, like most browsers or vscode, forcing srgb fixed the tissue for that app. however, this was also tedious to do for everything. in conclusion: i don\\'t know if my laptop was actually defective and this was like putting bandaids on it, or if this is how it\\'s intended to be, but it kinda sucks that i had to do this for a brand new >$1k laptop. anyways, hope this helped someone else with the same problem, let me know if there\\'s a better way to fix this. currently i have an older dell tb16 docking station. it works with the xps 13 plus except for the monitor connections. the hdmi port works fine. but there is no signal from the displayport connector. i don\\'t have a mini display port cable, so i cannot test that. both ports worked fine with my previous xps 9560. i have two external monitors. so currently i can only use one with this dock. i have a separate usb-c to hdmi/dp which i currently have plugged in the second usb-c port to connect the second monitor. i would like to have a single cable connection to a dock to connect everything. i could buy a new dock. but i would to be sure it will work with two monitors. anyone already tried a dock with two monitors in combination with the xps 13 plus that is known to work? hey all, so i recently got my new xps 15 and have been overall super happy with the device. it\\'s a premium feeling and performing windows machine with all the features i wanted, but one thing that really irks me is the extremely slow loading/buffering times when watching youtube. youtube also seems to be an outlier. granted, i don\\'t use many other video streaming platforms, but the few that i do don\\'t have this issue (doodwatch, mixstream, etc.). everytime i start a youtube video, i can be sitting there for 10-15 seconds waiting for it to load/buffer, and then the same thing happens when i pause it. it\\'s gotten so annoying that i\\'ve conditioned myself to \"preload\" videos and never pause, just spool back if i need to. and frankly it\\'s annoying, and unacceptable for a laptop in this segment. some online searching has lead me to look into the intel stupidity intelligence command center for the killer wifi card, to no avail. as the \"direct streaming detection\" option isn\\'t available in my version of the software. uninstalling the software hasn\\'t worked either. and changing the wifi card isn\\'t an option, as i bought it knowing that these chips are supposedly very good, and have no intention of opening the device whatsoever in the near future. my view of the killer intelligence center settings hi guys, i think this sub needs some reviews from happy users. i have my xps 15 9520 for some days now and i just love it. i9 12th gen 64 go ram ddr5 (bought with 16go and replaced by 64 go crucial => 400 € saved compared to dell 64 go option). 2 to nvme geforce rtx 3050 ti 4go i could read here a lot of people complaining about dell\\'s qc and stuff, but let\\'s say i\\'ve been lucky with that, and to me the finish of the product is just the best on the market. i really like the powering through the usb-c. in fact, one of the things that blow me up the most is the thunderbolt 4. i also bought a caldigit thunderbolt 4 element hub 60w. now, with only 1 cable plugged in the laptop, i have: power charge (slow mode, because going through the caldigit hub, but still !) gigabit ethernet network (with a usb-c to rj45 converter plugged in the hub) display port 1.4 (5120x1440, 240 hz, on my samsung odyssey g9 neo, using a dp <-> usb-c 8k cable plugged in the hub) all my usb devices (wireless keyboard/mouse, external speakers, etc.) and still some room for other usb devices. with 1 cable only.. that\\'s really amazing! and i still have 1 free remaining tb4 port + 1 free remaining usb-c 3.2 gen 2 for... god knows what. i couldn\\'t be happier about this purchase. it\\'s a beast and working on this is just awesome. i hope that will inspire some of you guys who are hesitating. new computer, only 2 months old. memory 32gb, 12-gen i7, 1tb storage over the last few days it has become super laggy and performance has gone down. i’ve used primarily chrome and excel and nothing else. i’ve tried running windows update and microsoft office update, neither of which have helped. can’t figure out why my new and snappy computer has all of a sudden gotten slow and laggy… i just placed an order yesterday for a xps 13 laptop https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/laptops/new-xps-13/spd/xps-13-9315-laptop/ctox13pw11p1c4002 and noticed the invoice showed about $195 1y prosupport plus, but i didn\\'t select that, and went back to the description of the tech specs and shows \"warranty 1 year prosupport plus with next business day onsite service\". i spoke to sales on instant message and they said you can\\'t remove it during checkout, but call and have it removed, so i called and got transferred like 4 times and they basically said it\\'s included, even though it\\'s a line item on the invoice. is there a way to remove this insurance? i will mostly use the laptop as a work computer + an external display which might need fractional scaling, if not fractional the display needs scaling for sure. once a month i might use it for light gaming which i expect it to use the nvidia card otherwise while working i would appreciate the battery life and keep nvidia card off. edit it has an oled screen and it would be a plus if fingerprint or other laptop specific features are supported. i just repasted my 9510 using kryonaut thermal grizzly. alos disabled turbo boost. when running 3dmark timespy i notice that the gpu clock speed is constantly throttled at around 1300mhz. while gpu load and power is at max and temp between 60-70’c(cpu a bit lower on temp) when testing with a game the clocks are ok (around 1700mhz) what can be the reason for this? i thought of vrm but wouldnt that limit the power to the gpu? i just placed an order yesterday for a xps 13 laptop

this extra insurance? hello everyone finally got my laptop. its so great apart from one thing. when i charge it, in the \"my dell\" app it says it is charging at a rate of 10 percent an hour and that it will take 5 hrs for it to fully charge. then when i unplugged and changed sides i put the charger in, the time it took for it to charge went to 1 hrs and 23 mins, at a rate of 50 percent an hr. but when i started watching a youtube video the rate keeps going back down. however, when i go to settings it says 1hr and 12 minutes left, a total stark contrast from the 5 hrs in the \"my dell\" app. i have some dirt in my speaker which i dont know how to clean. laptop is 2 weeks old and i always handle it with clean hands because i cant stand fingerprints etc so no idea how this happened. ive tried tape but it didnt work. thanks in advance i thought this model came in uhd as well like the 2021 model? i don\\'t like the touch panel for the f keys and escape key at all so i don\\'t want that model. anyone know if this is temporary or why the uhd model is not even listed for purchase or do they not have one this year? hello everyone. i got a dell xps 13 plus this morning, and it came at 23% battery. i plugged it in, and it\\'s at 95% now, but it has taken over six hours. it also started lagging in games and even youtube while plugged in. i\\'m not sure if it works better not plugged in. does anyone else experience any of this? are these know issues? are these even issues at all? thanks in advance. someone i\\'ve talked to who has been able to use multiple units of this laptop has consistently had this problem across all—wondering anyone else? i’m wondering how well an egpu will work with an intel core i7 dell xps 13 plus and what egpu i should get with it? a client of mine purchased three brand new dell xps 15 9510 laptops last november. two of the units have experienced zero issues but one of the units has been back and forth from dell\\'s service center since may and now dell is refusing to honor a replacement under a warranty that doesn\\'t end until november. has anyone experienced this issue with dell support recently? the complete history: the screen\\'s backlight failed in may and then the motherboard failed while the on-site dell technician was trying to replace the screen. dell\\'s own on-site technician reported that he didn\\'t have access to replacement motherboard so he requested a pre-paid shipping box from dell. the box arrived and the unit was sent out to have the screen and motherboard replaced. upon getting the computer back, the laptop arrived formatted. we then reinstalled the windows 10 operating system that\\'s assigned to the service tag, using dell\\'s very own os recovery tool. after the reinstallation was complete, we noticed that keypresses and cursor movements would lag and hitch during normal usage, every 2-3 minutes, for 5-10 seconds at a time -something that it didn\\'t do before. upon reporting the issue to dell support, alongside a jumping mouse cursor issue that didn\\'t exist previously, dell support accused me of installing the wrong operating system(it wasn\\'t) before apologizing and then provided me with an advance driver for the trackpad that they hoped would fix one of the issues -it didn\\'t. dell support then suspected it was an issue with the replacement motherboard or perhaps a swelling battery pressing into the trackpad. at this point in time, now well into july, two months without a working computer, i requested that dell replace the computer outright. dell support said that they were not able to honor a replacement of the laptop unless it was serviced a 3rd time within the warranty period. dell support said that if the issue was not fixed after sending the computer into service one more time, that they would honor a replacement under warranty. the laptop was then sent back to service who replaced the motherboard and the trackpad. upon getting the computer back, the computer was not formatted and thankfully, all my client\\'s data was still present so i was hopeful that i could get this back into my client\\'s hands quickly -boy was i wrong. upon logging into windows, i was able to test that the trackpad issue was no longer causing the cursor to jump around the screen(great!) but now the lag and hitching issue that previously occurred every 2-3 minutes, was now prevalent every 30 seconds(not great!). i replied back to the dell support technician that the lag and hitching issue was still prevalent and he apologized that the issue was still occurring. he then said that in order to provide a replacement laptop under warranty, that i would need to reply to the support email with a picture of the service tag at the underside of the laptop, including a piece of paper that included the name of the business that made the purchase, the address where the unit was originally shipped, as well as the service request number. upon replying to the ticket with the requested information, i get a different dell support technician that is now refusing to honor the replacement and is now saying the unit has to be serviced 3x within a 30 day period before they will honor the warranty. this new support technician requested that i reinstall the operating system again, so after i reinstalled the operating system (also using the dell oem image again) and reported that the issue was still prevalent, he is still refusing to replace the laptop and instead wants to schedule an appointment to send another dell technician on-site with an oem imaged replacement m.2 drive. this is getting ridiculous, help! at this point, my client has been without the laptop since may and now dell support is refusing to replace the computer and i\\'m not sure what the next steps are but my client doesn\\'t want anything to do with this defective laptop. since purchasing: the screen has been replaced one time. the motherboard has been replaced twice. the trackpad has been replaced one time. now they want to replace the hard-drive... the warranty expires in november. i\\'ve presented this issue to dell as being a common issue with the dell xps 9510 but they refuse to acknowledge that it\\'s an inherent issue: https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ie/000188375/blue-screen-drive-power-state-failure-or-system-lagging-in-the-os-environment

can\\'t find a way to lower the brightness of the function row on the dell xps 13 plus. googled for a little while but don\\'t get anything back, will continue to look but if anyone has one and knows or just knows the solution that would be really helpful! thanks i am upgrading from the 7590 model, and i am not sure if i should get fhd or 4k. i have an oled tv, best picture in the world to me but reading about poor battery life + burn in with laptops. laptop usage: - light work (documents, browsing websites, youtube videos) - 1-3 hours of daily usage - would play gta v, apex legends, sims and stardew valley maximum 12 hours a month combined and is this fhd a better screen quality than my xps 15 7590? i just ordered my xps 13 plus 9320 for university, and after reading about all the bad experiences i’m worried my laptop will come damaged. i ordered my xps 13 plus the other day, and just noticed today i ordered the dell docking station that’s usb3.0, not usb c so it obviously won’t work. i plan to cancel the order for the dock and buy a different dock but i can’t decide what’s best to get. i’m looking for something that has an ethernet port, ports for up to 2 monitors, and maybe a port to charge the laptop. some usb ports would be nice too. i liked the visiontek vt4000 for 240 cad, but it can’t charge my laptop. i found the vt4500 for 40 cad more on amazon which can charge it so i might go for that if there’s no better options. while i’m unsure if i need one that charges my laptop, having the ability to charge it would be nice for the future if i decide to get an egpu enclosure. any input is appreciated. thanks! so my dell xps 13 plus running ubuntu 22.04 randomly had the screen locked at the lowest brightness and the keyboard backlight cycles through random brightnesses. this hasn’t happened before. any ideas on what to do? possibly neither without knowing more about the networks in question. intrested in this as well i had one until upgrading to an xps 13 plus. it served me well, a lot of power for the form factor and worked great with my egpu enclosure. it\\'ll be fine with the top cpu and ram capacity unless you need a lot of gpu support (which can be fixed by buying an egpu setup). good morning. i\\'ve had my dell xps 17 2022 -9720 - these days. it has an important screen, comfortable keyboard and touchpad, excellent ram, but i did not expect you to feel the heat of the pc so much on your hands. in \"dell power manager\" by setting the thermal option \"cold\" the keyboard becomes thermally acceptable, but the fans are annoying: even if after a day i am noticing a slight worsening. over time this problem could be fixed with updates? could nvidia driver also be the problem? i also think maybe that the minimum thickness of the pc does not help it to dissipate heat: i looked at the recent precision dell 7770 on the dell website, has a new fan system and does not have the shape of the xps, from advertising it seems that it keeps the temperature low, but the configuration similar to that of my xps17 i think costs around 7000-8000 euros, about 3000-4000 euros more than mine. i\\'m sad about this problem. i thought i had bought a flawless laptop, given the price. thank you. ps. i haven\\'t verified the battery life. xps 17: proc: 12 gen intel core i9-12900hk (24 mb cache, 14 cores, 20 threads, up to 5.00 ghz turbo) o s:

am going to return one. i love them both. will be used for the main purpose of editing 1080p youtube videos in adobe premiere. no cgi work. light use of after effects. i will be updating either laptop to 64gb ram and 4tb storage. here are my concerns: does the bigger better touchscreen make the xps worth it or go with the better specs on the legion? how do both deal with heat? the legion seems to have a lot more openings for fans. do i need the better specs on the legion for what i\\'m doing? aren\\'t both overkill for what i need them for? is the 12th gen i7 and 3070 too much for the legion? will it get too hot? the xps only has thunderbolt ports so it needs a dock or adapters for everything. the legion has all the ports needed. the port thing is the only thing i don\\'t like about the xps. the screen and build quality rocks. hello. so i will be going into my first year of uni this year and was debating whether i shld buy 13 or 13 plus. i will mainly be using it for note taking, downloading files, emailing, streaming and if my interest remains, then video editting during vacations (not the main focus for now). i have heard that 13 plus functions far better than 13 but would that really make a big difference for a first year biology student? i dont need an exceptionally great speed and functioning as long as it doesn\\'t lag, has good speed, good battery life, is not heavy or too fragile. i am looking for weight similar to macbook pro 2018. pls lemme know if i shld invest in 13 plus or 13. so i just bought a xps 15 9510 and it’s a great laptop just really terrible battery life but the more i started to game on it the more i realized i’m not going back to console and may need a more powerful laptop to game on i’ve read that its not a gaming laptop but you can game on it depending on the game and that is true from my experience really leaning towards returning it any suggestions? i do a lot of photo post-processing on a 5-year old laptop running hot and slow. figured it\\'s time to get hardware that is up to the task. i am looking at a 8950, i7-12700k, 16gb ram, geforce 3060ti, 750w, liquid-cooled. does this machine go on sale often? is there a sale coming up to wait for or a place to buy with great prices? tia! dear redditors, i am in need of a new laptop as my old xps 15 9560 cpu has died. i am now torn appart between the new xps 15 and razer blade 15 advanced model. i mainly use the laptop for studies, video/photo editing and sometimes some light gaming. i expect the blade to perform better in most gpu demanding tasks and also be better with thermals, but i am afraid it’s going to constantly run loud. i am also worried about the longevity of the razer blade, as i would like the new laptop to work well for at least 3-4 years as my last xps. however, i like the design, higher refresh rate screen of the razer blade and potentially less cpu throttle, which was a problem on my last xps. although, xps has 16:10 screen ratio, which is appreciated. the battery life is not as important, as i use ipad for longer travels. thank you for any input regarding this decision! xps 15 9520 - 2300 € i7-12700h nvidia® geforce rtx™ 3050 ti 4

the usb-c ports. anyone else noticing this on their devices? wondering if mine is just faulty. \\u200b update: seems like this happens to a few people, and restarting fixes it. will update this thread if i can figure out what causes it to get into that state. thanks everyone! i’m planning to buy this laptop for university, with the 1260p, 16gb of ram and the 512gb ssd. the only problem i’ve had with deciding what to get is with the screen. i’ll be getting the 1200p monitor, but i can’t seem decide on getting the touch screen version or the non-touch version. on one hand the extra battery life will be nicer, but idk if the screen will look any worse. the only thing i could find online was from 6 years ago that said the ppi was lower on the non touch version. just got my xps 13 2022 9315, and it is working fine, when i got into a discord call and turned on my camera, after about 12 seconds my friends saw a green and purple glitchy overlay on top of my camera, but this did not show for me. the camera app works fine and takes pictures that look normal, yet my camera still shows this overlay for other people viewing my camera, any assistance would be greatly appreciated. thank you. so i bought my latest xps 9520 mid june, the first week my battery was lasting about 7 hours using browsers, coreldraw, illustrator and photoshop on and off. as of today, shy of two months, the battery is only lasting about 3 hours, with the same usage load and programs. \\u200b did i get a faulty battery or is this normal? i have barely made one payment and my battery capacity is already less than half of what it was, in less than to months. which is better for everyday use and for some light gaming? for those who have tried or know the new xps 13 plus, regarding the new capacitive function row, can the brightness of those leds be changed or even turned off, seperate from the brightness level of the regular backlit keyboard? can this controlled in software settings or how does that work? also, when you press one of those capacitive leds will they become brighter when you touch them and afterwards auto-reverse to less bright? hope somebody can clarify all this cause i don\\'t like leds constantly on that are too bright in the eyes. thanks for all good feedback on this. am i losing my mind?! i have used my chromebook for quick internet only based tasks, and said why not get a laptop. this xps 13 plus is a beauty. the thing is i have not used a laptop for so long, and i naturally have used this longer than i would me chromebook. i need it flat on a desk or in lapdesk so i can type faster, but then it is not eye level and the strain on my neck, the neck lines, no no heck no. so now as i type this on my xps, i am at my desk looking up at my 32 in monitor and how comfortable it is to just look without bending my neck and just see the screen and type comfortably. am i trippin? i am starting to see a laptop is not for me. which is blowing my mind. i guess the 15 minutes i used the chromebook or while using the restroom, i never noticed how uncomfortable it is to look down at a laptop. the desktop desks fix the eye level issue, but my hands are not flat on the keyboard and now i have arm fatigue and cannot type fast and accurately. am i the only one facing this? i am struggling to understand how i did not correct this behavior years ago. is the dell return period 10 days or 30 days from the date of delivery? i got a deal on this machine and don’t want to kick myself a year or so later if something changes and i wish i had access to a pc on the go, or is there some posture or furniture that will alleviate my neck concerns. definitely leaning towards retaining my xps 8950 desktop and mechanical keyboard and train myself to get up and stretch(from sitting, not neck fatigue), and accept all workloads cannot get done in one setting. it is in those moments of sitting discomfort that i was saying i need a laptop so i can sit on my recliner and knock this out, the chromebook isn’t powerful os for that so here i bought the pc. but if sitting on my recliner feeling great, but my neck, i have to look down at an angle to type freely, or if i use my table stand it does give me the eye height but my typing isn’t as comfortable and suffers. please provide me your experience(s) and recommendations, all is appreciated. i am literally sitting here having a “a ha” moment. starting to think the recliner is for the recliner, and the desktop is for the desk. a laptop is a disaster for your neck, and if i get something to raise the laptop screen to my eye level, and use a separate keyboard, well why did you buy a laptop! lmao ahhah argh!! tldr; is dell return period 10 or 30 days from the day you receive your online order are their people who refuse to use a laptop for the aforementioned and only use desktops just got my xps 13 2022 9315, and it is working fine, when i got into a discord call and turned on my

ram 1tb ssd 165 hz qhd display i\\'ve been trying to find any kind of 3rd party usb-c pd supported power supplies or docks that will work on this 2022 dell xps15 9520, but to no avail. each one i\\'ve plugged in gives the dreaded \"boot screen power error\" notice saying that there is not enough wattage to run and charge the laptop. i tried various models on the market from 20w to 90w, and all gave the same error message. and yes, i assumed that the 20w wouldn\\'t work, but i was checking to see if it was even recognized. so today i chatted with dell tech support and they tell me that this is done by design. the 9520 requires and will not work properly with anything less than a 130w charger no 3rd party chargers have been tested by dell, and so none are supported any docks used on this laptop must supply 130w or more through usb-c pd there are no usb-if pd compliant devices that support 130w, thus no docks are supported maybe i missed it somewhere, but i went looking for this kind of info on the dell site prior to my purchase. i couldn\\'t find it. now support says, basically, \"130w is what is required, only dell makes an adapter or dock that supports it, so you have no 3rd party options.\" they also helpfully blamed the 3rd parties building to-spec usb-c pd devices, saying that not supporting dell\\'s proprietary 130w or 180w charging is their problem, not dell\\'s, even though, as far as i can tell, there is no standard for such charging rates. just wanted to share this in case anyone else makes the mistake i did and buys any of the dell 2022 usb-c pd charging laptops. very disappointed in this situation. good morning. i just received my dell xps 17 2022 (9720). it has a fabulous screen, like the keyboard and touchpad, and great ram, but i didn\\'t expect you to feel the heat of the pc so much on your hands. in \"dell power manager\" by setting the thermal option \"cold\" the keyboard becomes perfect from a thermal point of view, but the fans are annoying. do you think that over time this problem will be solved with updates? i think that the subtlety of the pc does not help it to dissipate heat: i saw the new precision dell 7770, it has a new fan system and does not have the shape of the xps, from the description on the site it seems that it maintains the temperature perfectly, but the configuration similar to that of my xps i think costs around 7000 euros, about 3000 euros more than mine. i\\'m sorry for this problem! thank you. \\u200b ps. i haven\\'t checked the battery life yet. xps 17: processor: 12 gen intel® core™ i9-12900hk (24

produce is when i adjust the volume bar in the bottom-right windows settings.... so clearly the speaker is working. however, i can\\'t get sound to work anywhere else. the \"test sound\" doesn\\'t work, and i\\'ve run the native troubleshooter to try and resolve it. honestly i\\'m lost as to what i can do here. under my device manager and sounds... i see 3 versions of \"realtek soundwire hw audio codec driver\" and 3 different intel smart sound technologies. can anyone confirm they see it differently? edit: fix was to uninstall the driver and used the windows update tool and the dell driver tool to reinstall it i just received my dell xps 9510: i7-11800h/oled/16gb/1tb/rtx 3050 ti. for the most part, i am very happy with its performance. however, the battery drains incredibly fast (2-4 hours) and the computer runs incredibly hot while running even the most basic of tasks (just having chrome open). i have contacted dell support and an agent was not able to fix the issue. i have read on dell forums that some people have been able to fix both the battery and heat issues by doing a “clean install” of windows. since the computer is new, it’s not a massive deal for me; i don’t mind doing it. however, i’d like to see if anyone else has suggestions before i wipe my computer. thanks! hi, i just got my xps 15 2022 model with i7 3050ti and i\\'m trying to work through setting up a external monitor (fhd 144hz) that only supports hdmi 2.0 and display port 1.2. if i connect usb-c to hdmi and connect it to a 144hz monitor will i get a 144hz refresh rate or do i need to purchase a separate multiport hub? if need, i would like to find one that also supports ethernet, and maybe a couple more usb-a ports that is budget friendly. my bottor right corner sagging out of the box. other users i know have same problem in same place. gonna try to warranty. otherwise unfamillar with older model issues and everything else seems fine. one note though, considering the size of the trackpad i find myself touching it accidentally with the palm of my hand resulting in weird double clicks and selections :) 1st world problems i guess hey. like the title says. 9710, 17\" 1080p. i7. 3060. 16gb ram, 512gb ssd how much is it worth used? still under warranty. \\u200b also. is it better to buy a used 9720 for around 1400-1500 usd than wait for the new dell xps in spring? i really want 90/120hz but im not sure they will make it. there own been a few random post about kingston and g. skill, but then some follow up saying some did \\u200f\\u200f\\u200e not work? has anyone successfully upgraded to 64gb of ram? anyone use crucial? hi, i\\'m looking at the xps 13 or 15 (probably 13). it\\'s for general use; light development, minor blender usage, lots of web browsing, etc. nothing too fancy. i\\'ve been looking at the options and i had a few questions if anyone can help me: i want to put ubuntu on the machine as my main os. i assume i shouldn\\'t have any problem if i order the \"windows home\" option, and then do a gparted/whatever thing to split the disk and dual boot? how bad are the problems with linux? i\\'m seeing such mixed things, some people saying it\\'s fine with the xps\\'s, others saying it\\'s a nightmare. i\\'m not trying to do anything too fancy, but i need things like bluetooth and wifi to work reliably. i also read some stuff about sleep not working with them? i\\'m not trying to do anything special, i just want to be able to put my computer in my bag and not come back and find that it\\'s all hot because it never turned off. i\\'m having a hard time telling the difference on the website between the \"xps 13\", \"new xps 13 plus\", and \"new xps 13\"... from what i can tell, the \"xps 13\" doesn\\'t have many options, the \"new xps 13\" has buttons rather than the touch bar, but not as good screens, and the \"new xps 13 plus\" has nice screens, nicer hardware options, and the touch bar? are there any other considerations i should take into account when choosing between them? i\\'m very skeptical of the touch bar but if it\\'s not terrible i could be swayed. thanks in advance for any advice! hi everyone, i\\'ve been eyeing the 9520 and will likely be buying it in august. i can be crazy, but i remember that when the 9520 was released, the discrete gpu options were the rtx 3050 with 40w and the rtx 3050 ti with 45w for an extra $100. dell is now listing both the 3050 and the 3050 ti as having 45w (see picture). could this be accurate? if so, does it make any sense to spend the extra $100 for the ti version? i will rarely game on this machine, at some point i will want to play flight simulator, but that would be 5% or less of the usage. it will be used for office work, photo editing every other month, and media consumption. had to return my xps 13 plus earlier last month for a replacement due to the trackpad haptic feedback calling it quits one week in. really enjoyed the rest of the machine though, but it is somewhat worrying considering how unreliable the trackpad could be years down the line after warranty expires. any hardware-savvy people know if third party computer repair stores can access/fix the trackpad when it eventually fails, or would i have to pay big bucks to dell? hello, i just received my dell xps 9510: i7-11800h/oled/16gb/1tb/rtx 3050 ti. for the most part, i am very happy with

specs: i9, 32 ram, uhd+ touch screen, 1 tb hard drive the batter report: design capacity 95,065 mwh full charge capacity 91,200 mwh i turned off all programs running in the background and the screen brightness is never set at the brightest. i really only surf the internet, use word or powerpoint. but the battery only lasts about 4 hours on a full charge. any tips for getting a longer battery life? my partner has a desktop with three monitors. 2 extended and 1 clone, all 1920x1080. she also uses a laptop while away from home. i had the idea of combining the devices and getting her a new laptop. the two devices i’ve been looking at are the inspiron 14 5420 and the xps 13 9320. from the admittedly small amount of reading i’ve done i’m having difficulty determining how many external monitors a laptop will support, and with which dock. much of the advice i\\'ve found seems to assume you already have the laptop to run some tests on but i haven\\'t bought one yet. is it the case that a laptop will always support whatever number of display outputs a dock features or is it more complicated than that? can anyone offer any advice for her use case here? as the title says, my device takes an extremely long time (1 min and 40 sec) to boot (from when i push the power button to the windows login screen). i already tried some common throubleshooting like: turn off fast boot. reinstall audio drivers reinstall gpu drivers update all the drivers execute dell supportassist disable all startup applications change the boot order update windows 11 to the latest release but the boot behaviour does not change. do you have any suggestions? also, whenever i leave my pc in sleep mode for more than 10-12 hours it does not wake up anymore when i press some keys and i need to forcibly turn it off by pressing the power button. using a throw-away because i\\'m too embarrassed to post under my normal account. i was attempting to replace the thermal pads with thermal paste on my 9520 to lessen the throttling, but somewhere something went terribly wrong and my laptop won\\'t boot. it gets to the dell screen and it stays there. i\\'m going to hang up on the idea of using thermal paste and go back to thermal pads to see if i can recover from this mess. can anyone suggest thermal pads i might use to (hopefully) recover from this mess? i\\'m praying that i can save the laptop, or i have a very expensive paperweight. hello, i noticed today that i may have trackpad issues with my 1 week old xps 15 9520. the right side of my trackpad isn\\'t as \\'clicky\\' or doesn\\'t click as deeply compared to the original left side. is this a common issue? does anyone else have fingerprint oil residue on the keys and trackpad area? i specifically have a spot where i primarily interact with the touchpad, and several of the keys. i don\\'t have this issue with other products. in fact, because its new, i make sure my hands are super clean before using the laptop. \\u200b any suggestions on how to get the oil out of the glass? it just looks like a stain which is so weird. argh! lol windex? since it is gorilla glass! lol hahah edit: resolution in the comments hello, thinking about getting a dell xps 13 9315, as the plus is not available in belgium. first of all, the screen itself: can someone tell me how much of a tradeoff the screen size is, when i now have the xps 15 2018 model? i can\\'t find any good picture comparing the two. also for the same reasing i think i\\'m getting the fhd version, as the qhd oled version won\\'t deliver much benefit on such a small screen. secondly: is the i7 worth the money. i occasionally work in hyper-v, compiling in visual studio. so i guess, it\\'s worth having the i7? whenever i\\'m on slack calls where people share their screen, the laptop slows down to a crawl because the integrated gpu is being used. i see in task manager that the intel igpu is being used up to 100%, while the dedicated gpu is only being used for 5-15%. i\\'ve tried disabling the igpu but that means i can no longer use external monitors which is a dealbreaker. is there a way to make this laptop useable for work or what other options do i have? hey, so the company i work for gave me a precision 7560, and i just got an xps 15 9520 since i\\'m starting college this year and needed a new laptop. i know both laptops have an aluminum chassis but the xps\\' material makes a much clearer ringing sound when touching the vent cover. does anyone know if they used a different type of aluminum? i have a xps 9510 laptop and i added a crucial p2 1tb ssd to the second m.2 slot. after adding the second drive i started getting random audio dropouts/jitters. the latencymon tool confirmed it was a dpc latency problem related to storport.sys and, after disabling the second drive from the device manager, the issue went away. i used the dell heat spreader kit for the second drive. what should i do to resolve this? are only oem ssds supported? thanks! hey folks, i\\'m wondering if anyone else is having this issue. whenever i start a game in anything other than the native 3456x2160 resolution, i get a full kaleidoscope of colors. i took photos of the issue with my phone because screenshots show nothing awry. i assume this means it\\'s a problem with the oled screen?

i\\'ve been using it for the past couple of days. before this, i had the dell xps 13 2-in-1 from 2016 so this was a huge upgrade. some initial thoughts: pros: i got the sky-blue color and it is gorgeous. they did away with the carbon fiber black color-way and instead opted for unibody aluminum. i love how the laptop is cool to the touch each time you open it. it is also less of a fingerprint magnet the laptop is slightly lighter than my old xps 13 but a few tenth of a lbs if not something you can feel immediately. however, compare to my previous laptop, you get a sense that it\\'s quite well built. very rigid and hefty (despite being light). must be the aluminum... they keyboard feels amazing and tactile. maybe my bar isn\\'t very high for keyboards but it\\'s been a joy typing on this laptop (i average about 98 on 10fastfingers on my previous laptop, i can get 105 pretty consistently on this one) i got the i7, 512gb ssd, 16gb ram version for about $1,200 before tax which i thought was a great deal because it occupied the exact sweet spot for my budget. again i am biased here but compared to my 2016 xps 13, this laptop flies! i\\'d say it\\'s almost as fast as my 10 year-old desktop. the pace of cpu speed increase is just amazing cons: the backlight in the keyboard is horrendous and i never have it on... the light actually makes the keys less visible because of the sky blue color. you get better contrast for the letters when the backlight is off my previous laptop was fan-less so i might be biased here. the laptop is very quiet for light web browsing but becomes audible once you start having multiple productivity apps open (slack, outlook, vscode, multiple chrome tabs, etc.). you won\\'t really notice it in an office or cafe environment, but in a very quiet environment like your bedroom or the library, you\\'ll definitely notice the fan spinning up. it\\'s not extremely loud or anything. i think i just need to get used to it. i find it kind of hard to open the laptop with one hand... it\\'s not a hinge thing. the machine-cut aluminum is so precise and slippery that i find it hard to stick my finger into the crevice to open the screen. i\\'m definitely getting better at it though. i think the trick is to use two fingers to pinch the edges so you can get enough friction, rather than trying to get a finger nail in. i\\'ve been living the dongle life for the past 6 years but some part of me kind of wish to have the convenience of more ports... the lack of a headphone jack was a letdown but i recently bought a bluetooth headphone and it\\'s been working pretty well windows 11 took some getting used to but i think i\\'ve ironed out most of the kinks. this isn\\'t related to the laptop at all but just wanted to bring it up for those who are also transitioning from a windows 10 laptop to windows 11 laptop \\u200b overall i am quite satisfied :d hello, i\\'m planning to buy this laptop with: 15.6\", uhd+ 3840x2400, 60hz, touch, anti-reflect, 500 nit, infinityedge but i wonder if i\\'ll have issues with linux (fedora, popos, or ubuntu) i have heard there are issues with linux and 4k displays, so i want to ask those who own a laptop of this charactetics and use linux as os. also, the display options seems to be restricted to 60hz, isn\\'t that a low refresh rate? what about those display with 120hz or more? how bad is a 4k display with 60hz? thanks! is anybody else experiencing discord video issues with the xps 13 plus? my videos start off fine, but then it distorts into a green/purple visuals. this is making discord video calls very annoying. the fixes i\\'ve tried that have been unsuccessful: complete clean install of win 11 getting the most up-to-date display drivers straight from intel turning off hardware acceleration in discord allowing discord to bypass firewalls allowing discord to have all permissions with the camera uninstalling all unused apps, and disabling irrelevant start-ups any help would greatly be appreciated. i am just about ready to return the laptop and go with another manufacturer. i had my 9320 set up with 2 external monitors and it was working fine. i normally work with the laptop lid closed and use the 2 externals, but it also works fine with the laptop open. yesterday i took the laptop to the office and plugged it into a single external monitor. today when i plug back into my home setup only one of the external monitors works when i close the laptop lid. the other says \"no usb-c signal from your device\". i\\'ve tried making the one that shuts down the primary display, but no dice. has anyone else had this and figured out the issue? so i got the dell xps 13 plus. i like everything about it, except that, on arrival, the fan is stuttering with a loud noise. the cpu fan is presumably broken. when i watch a youtube video, the graphics driver crashes and the screen goes white, the videos stutter and crash is this a cpu issue or just a fan not working issue? hi, i recently received my xps plus and i really love it except for the battery life, i have the i7-1260p, 32 gb ram, 512 gb ssd, and fhd non-touch display. i\\'m getting around 5 - 6 hours, with just web browsing/video streaming. i want to maximize my battery life, and i heard that the i5 model can get around 8 maybe 9 hours with a similar load, can anyone confirm this? also, on a related note, has anyone figured out how to undervolt their cpu, it seems to be locked? been having some issues lately. the 9510 will freeze, i think it\\'s usually been when i\\'m running illustrator. nothing will unfreeze so i have to hold the power button down and force it to shut down. other times, i will close the lid to put it to sleep and later on when i go to open it, it won\\'t come back on. i\\'ll plug it in thinking the battery died, but nothing. eventually after like 10 minutes (while unplugged), i\\'ll try again and it will come back on to the blue screen and make me restart. after restart it shows that i have full battery, even though i\\'ve barely had it plugged in. really trying to avoid sending in for warranty work, but i only have until 10/21 before my warranty is over. i\\'ve heard it could be a cpu issue, but i\\'m honestly a dummie so need help from you fine people. i had the same issue. dell replaced bottom case, system board, speakers, palmrest in 2 visits. issue was still there. bought xps 17 instead. i\\'m trying to find the name of this dell application that i uninstalled, but wanted to research it but when i put the name of what i thought it was no dice. the app i thought was dell power something. the icon was what or grey looking with a speedometer speedtest meter similar to the speedtest app icon with a needle measurement. i can\\'t seem to find a list of stock apps that come with the xps 13 plus i\\'m hoping someone uses the dell app or didn\\'t unistall their dell apps or just got their xps 13 plus and can tell me the name of the application once they\\'ve got inside their device?. i\\'d really appreciate this info to put my mind at ease 😢😅 this issue has been driving me crazy for the last week and all i want is my laptop to work properly. everything was working fine until i noticed very recently that the fans were kicking in much more than usual, as well as the battery life dropping from 6-7 hours down to 2. i used hwinfo to view the battery drain to find that it’s constantly draining between 30-40w at all times. the laptop also remains hot and fans do not ever spin down. this also includes when inside the bios, the fans spin to max and the laptop gets hot while just sitting on the bios homepage. i’ve tried reinstalling windows, reinstalling a previous bios update, reinstalling gpu drivers etc. i cannot figure out what is causing this issue!! the thing that also drives me crazy is that i managed to find a temporary fix by accident, the problem goes away completely if i use the “restart” option. after a restart, drain drops to 5-12w and battery life goes back to 6-8 hours. however using shutdown, hibernate, or sleep all result in the issue returning…! any help or ideas for diagnosing this issue would be appreciated, my current theory is that something is keeping the 3060 gpu running at all times but if that is the case why is it running in the bios? and why does a restart fix it…?! this is an amazing laptop but the issue is really getting on my nerves. so i got the dell xps 13 plus. i like everything about it, except that, on arrival, the fan is stuttering with a loud noise. the cpu fan is presumably broken. when i watch a youtube video, the graphics driver crashes and the screen goes white, the videos stutter and crash is this a cpu issue or just a fan not working issue? is anybody else experiencing discord video issues with the xps 13 plus? my videos start off fine, but then it distorts into a green/purple visuals. this is making discord video calls very annoying. the fixes i\\'ve tried that have been unsuccessful: complete clean install of win 11 getting the most up-to-date display drivers straight from intel turning off hardware acceleration in discord allowing discord to bypass firewalls allowing discord to have all permissions with the camera uninstalling all unused apps, and disabling irrelevant start-ups any help would greatly be appreciated. i am just about ready to return the laptop and go with another manufacturer. video screenshot i have an xps 17 9700 and a tb16 dock. the 9700 is infamous for its battery drain under load when plugged in. i managed to borrow a tb18dc dock cable (just the cable) for the weekend. i wanted to see if i can convert my tb16 to a tb18 and maybe get the 210w charging that the tb18 offers. i know i\\'m not the only one who has thought about this, so this is for anyone else digging into the matter. to my knowledge, the 16 and 18 are identical hardware-wise except for the cable that plugs into the laptop. although it explicitly states that the 18 only works on a specific pair of 7k precisions i figured i might as well give it a bash and see what happens. i didn\\'t even know if the cable would fit on a 9700 as it doesn\\'t split like a wd19dc does. i remember reading on some obscure datasheet / marketing bumf that the connectors were 16.2mm centre to centre. i measured my 9700 with a pair of callipers and it was close enough. it ended up fitting perfectly when i plugged in. it\\'s either a lucky coincidence (re-used twin-port design from other models?) or they might have considered making the laptop compatible early in the design stage and then decided otherwise. either way, the cable fit perfectly at both ends (dock and laptop), so i went on to power everything on. this is pretty much where everything hit a snag. the laptop wasn\\'t happy with the dock. sometimes it would complain about the power input and disable charging, sometimes it would only charge at 60w. i tried all the ports except the vga (i don\\'t own a vga cable) and not a single one worked. the dock didn\\'t even show up in the thunderbolt control centre. as far as i can work out, all the drivers between the 16 and 18 are the same. the only difference was the firmware. now, i don\\'t know if the firmware is actually different or whether the same file had different names based on the dock page you downloaded it from, but i didn\\'t want to try my luck. i have a unicorn 16 that works pretty well, i didn\\'t want to risk bricking it with firmware. that\\'s why this whole experiment was inconclusive. i didn\\'t have an 18 to test with, just the cable. so, if anyone reading this has access to a tb18dc and an xps 17 (i\\'m guessing the 9710 and 20 would also fit the cable), could you please give it a go and reply back with the results, i\\'m really curious if it works. i don\\'t want to spend some £50 buying an 18 for an experiment that might not work. hello! just bought the dell xps 15 9510 16gb 11800h 1tb 3.5k oled. it was cheap for an open box product from bestbuy and found out it was the floor model. battery life ain’t what it used to be but honestly i’m ok with that as my use case is not ultimate portability. anyway i ran into a few issues with performance but i’ve been reading up on this sub which has fixed some issues. disabling intel speedstep solved a problem i had where on battery it would experience a severe slowdown when i connected to an external monitor (like a conference room) and i was able to increase my pass mark score from 13k to 19k with changing throttlestop settings like pl1/2 and enabling turbo. in the near future i have some new thermal paste and pads to install to give it some much needed cooling (always maxes at 100c but strangely not hot to touch). my final issues are as follows (both connected to a power source): 1. when typing in word sometimes the text takes 5 seconds to appear as i type. i have to restart the program to remove this but sometimes i have to restart my computer. any idea what is causing this? i had a teams screen sharing and was trying to scroll a word document and it was painfully laggy. once i stopped sharing my screen it was normal. is this a ram issue? thought 16gb would be enough...but getting 64gb for under $200 sounds tempting. anyone experience these before and had solutions that works? let me know, thanks! i ran benchmarks on my xps 15 9520, i9 . on pop-os , whether i use charger or not, the performance is same, on windows its a different story. also different power modes on pop-os makes a difference, but on windows, i dont see it does. here are the geekbench scores. https://preview.redd.it/x6zyzuw9q6f91.jpg?width=1039&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc570ab46a66e1cb021ef3bc9fb967ed6874eec4 i bought a 9720 a couple of months ago and was having a great time with it for awhile. i only used it for gaming. now all of a sudden the gpu is maxing out at 15 fps on frostpunk where it used to go at 55 for days, and can\\'t really handle much of anything. i\\'ve tried reseting windows 11, uninstalling and manually installing nvidia driver from the website, nothing is working. how can i diagnose the gpu issue? is it possible that it\\'s damaged already? if necessary, what do i need to tell dell to get this thing replaced? not gonna work :( you should hide your email. hi im moving to hong kong for a semester abroad this august and im looking into to puchasing a new xps 15 for school. so i am wondering if i should buy it a home or when i get there. the price in my home country is equivalent to 16.500 hkd, for the i7 base model, with the 3050 ti. what should i expect to pay for a similar system in hong kong? oled my old xps 13 9360 is starting to slow down and the screen is partially cracked so it\\'s time for a replacement. for those that have already bought the new xps 13 plus, what do you think are the most important configurable items that are worth it? i use mine to run three screens, work emails, word processing, online work via a variety of platforms and some via vpn, and the hardest application i regularly run is google earth. i would prefer battery life over a nice screen, but if there isn\\'t much of a difference, i wouldn\\'t mind the nicer screen options. thinking about 16 gbs minimum. any help would be well.... helpful! thanks! hey everyone, i\\'ve ran into issues with my dell xps 9520 and touch screen reliability. i\\'ve fought with this issue quite a bit and have learned from registry tweaks that made significant improvements in touch screen responsiveness. thought i would share these in case other 9520 users were having the same problem. my problem: i was experiencing was erroneous double tap and pinch to zoom gestures that were being registered by the touch screen even though i was just doing normal taps and scrolling with one finger. i\\'m not sure if this was unique to my laptop, unique to my fingertips, or other environmental conditions like humidity, but that was what i was running into. basically while scrolling a document it would suddenly zoom out 50% or would bring up the context menu because i thought i had done a double press (which maps to a right click). it was very intrusive and made the touch screen essentially unusable. the fix: i had dell service replaced the display thinking that there was something wrong with the manufacturing of the digitizer layer. a new display had exactly the same behavior. eventually, i edited a few registry settings within microsoft touchprediction which have helped it significantly and made it almost completely usable without too many mis-presses. it\\'s now about 98% accurate with the fingerpresses whereas before it was like 80% accurate. registry updates: the 2 settings i changed were under: computer\\\\hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\touchprediction the default latency and sampletime were both 8 i changed latency=1 and sampletime = 0x40 (64 decimal value). you can play around with these numbers and find an optimal setting. i found that decreasing the latency and increasing sampletime worked the best in the end. initially, i had decreased both values to 2. this was what had been recommended by other online forms, but i did find my values to work the best for the laptop. they did say that decreasing these values may negatively impact battery life, i didn\\'t notice this for me but i have such different workloads throughout the day that i could never feel the impact of battery life. hope this helps someone out there. i’ve actually had two different 9320s at this point and both have issues going to sleep. i will tell it to go to sleep and the screen/keyboard lights shutoff but it never really goes to sleep. this happens probably 7/10 times i try to put it to sleep. any tips? running windows 11. hi all, curious where i can get this wallpaper image? thanks!

does anyone else have fingerprint oil residue on the keys and trackpad area? i specifically have a spot where i primarily interact with the touchpad, and several of the keys. i don\\'t have this issue with other products. in fact, because its new, i make sure my hands are super clean before using the laptop. \\u200b any suggestions on how to get the oil out of the glass? it just looks like a stain which is so weird. argh! lol windex? since it is gorilla glass! lol hahah i am noticing worse performance when connected to the tv despite using a much lower resolution then the computer supports. does the dedicated graphics card not work with external displays or is there a setting to make this happen? any help appreciated. that\\'ll be good to know for users, basically any nvidia rtx gpu is a good bump in performance, with diminishing returns the higher you go. how\\'s resolve been so far on it? i hear good things about it paired with xps 15, looking to ditch premiere soon and i\\'ve been testing out resolve a bit more lately but haven\\'t tried it for a full project yet. hi everyone, i\\'m currently deciding to buy either the xps 13 or the xps 13 plus what are the main key differences between the two and if that price jump really worth it to get the xps 13 plus. i\\'m planning to get this machine for a everyday usage, sometimes i will encounter some fps games but not often. what the title says. it does well very occasionally and gets me >150 fps in gta 5 when it uses 100% of the gpu, but it drops to ~30% of the gpu (and stays there) for the vast majority of the time giving me <60 fps. i’ve tested it on other games too, but the usage is nowhere as bad as it is in gta. updated drivers and everything, very frustrating. any ideas/solutions? many thanks. i was wondering what steps would one take to i crease the longevity of the battery capacity. i\\'ll be running a debian-based distro over windows, most of the time the gpu (3050) will be deactivated, and i have the fhd non-touch screen instead of the qhd touch screen. what would you guys recommend doing (i.e. charge up to x% and don\\'t let it drop below x%...)? i\\'m just wondering with the killer wifi card and the often noticed issues, plus the disabled 6e support. would there be an upgrade to another wifi card that\\'s noticeable? or is this as good at it can get? hi folks, unfortunately i\\'m having significant issues with my dell xps 13 plus 9230. for example, substantial lag while doing everyday tasks like watching a movie. swapping between applications etc. my model is the i7-1260p 16g ram. i am planning to do a follow up video asap to warn buyers of these issues. if you are also having issues please let me know below what you are experiencing. photos/videos appreciated. thanks, just josh hi everyone, i want to add a new ssd to my xps 9710 but the one i want have a heatsink attached to it. will this kind of ssd will fit if i remove the stock heatsink ? hi. i\\'m looking to purchase the laptop for office and light dev work. i\\'m particularly interested in the i5 with iris xe graphics model. i plan on using it with 16 gb of ram for office and light dev work using fedora36. my main concern is fan noise and heat. i have purchased a dell xps 17 9720 with the following specification: -12700h -16gb ram- -3060 -1080p \\u200b i used the laptop for a couple of days and got a max of 3 hours of battery life while doing light tasks like web surfing and using excel. after some searching i decided to do a full clean install of windows 11 with only the necesairy drivers. with nothing else installed but drives and the screen on the dimmest setting i am getting 4 hours of battery life. i have nvidia drivers installed and have set the intergrated gpu to default, while doing light tasks i disconnent the 3060 through the nvidia drivers. reading through this forum i see mixed opinions about the batterylife of a xps 17 some people are getting similar results to me. meanwhile i see people claiming 6+ hours on battery doing light tasks. any tweaks or tools that could help me identify my battery problem would be tramendous. hi folks, unfortunately i\\'m having significant issues with my dell xps 13 plus 9230. for example, substantial lag while doing everyday tasks like watching a movie. swapping between applications etc. my model is the i7-1260p 16g ram. i am planning to do a follow up video asap to warn buyers of these issues. if you are also having issues please let me know below what you are experiencing. photos/videos appreciated. thanks, just josh hi! i\\'ve recently decided to purchase the i7 oled model of the 9320, and i understand the battery will take a big hit. my question is, how fast is it to recharge, and are dell\\'s claims accurate about expresscharge? i ended up going with the oled as it\\'s pretty rare that i use my laptop without access to a power source. hi, i\\'m deciding between these two laptops, and honestly, i\\'m already lost in it. i\\'m not sure if the gpu in the xps(3050ti 45w) will be enough for me, the rog has the 3070ti 125w. and i still wanted to ask if any of you had a chance to try the 12th gen i7 and ryzen 9 6900hs. i mainly use blender, adobe apps, learning in unity and occasional gaming. i\\'m really asking you all for any advice, ideas, anything. thank you i\\'m planning to redo my thermal paste on my 9520 this weekend. i\\'d like to do a before and after snapshot of heat, throttling, performance, etc. for the project. can anyone recommend software that will paint a picture of the benefit of the new paste? free would be nice, but i\\'m open for paid if it gives much more accurate results. thanks! dodge the docking station and go usb-c to displayport. that will get you high refresh rates. since i purchased this a month ago, the battery does not charge to full capacity. this is also true with one of the other 9520s i bought for an employee. letting it run dry with a \"calibration\" resulted in a lower battery capacity on the other device. so that wasn\\'t successful. does anyone have any other advice? https://preview.redd.it/umqcb5sjdie91.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=7adfa36528fd72665f59efedabdc5406a0756d3c i want to get a xps 17 for video editing. should i max out all the options or is that overkill? what specs do you recommend? the xps 9520 ships with the killer 1675 (ax211) wi-fi card which supports 6ghz according to intel. my xps 9520 will not connect to 6ghz, and dell support is adamantly telling me that it does not support 6ghz and it is disabled. i know 6ghz is not adopted by all countries, but i am in the us where it is. is it deceptive that dell has intentionally disabled it? hey guys i\\'m looking to buy a new/second charger for my 9310 which can also charge other things. i was looking into some chargers and as my 9310 shipped with a 45w charger and the oe dell upgrade is a 65w charger i originally searched for a 65w one. but i came around a great deal for an aukey omnia pa-b6s 90w charger and was wondering if any of you have experience with this one or with 90w charger in general? does it generate to much heat or will the charger regulate the wattage itself? thank you for your help (as you can maybe tell i have no clue about electrical things) hi folks, unfortunately i\\'m having significant issues with my dell xps 13 plus 9230. for example, substantial lag while doing everyday tasks like watching a movie. swapping between applications etc. my model

appreciated. thanks, just josh argh! i like the capacitive keys; i just need more control of them. i keep hitting home/insert/end and it messes up my typing or selects all and erases my text and if i am not in word, it becomes an issue because i can’t “undue” as easily in other applications, so i am screwed lol! when i plug in my headphones or an aux cable, my sound output doesn\\'t switch. i have to do a restart or disable (then enable) realtek audio from device manager to get it to switch. i have already re-installed realtek audio drivers and enabled waves maxxaudio but it\\'s still not switching automatically. are there any workarounds for this? that looks a little sketchy. it\\'s essentially a cantilever, so if you put any amount of pressure on the end of it, it\\'s going to end up torquing the port. it doesn\\'t look particularly heavy and you can\\'t plug anything with real heft into it, but nonetheless, you\\'re still applying some amount of force to it. looking good hey folks, got a weird one. i stripped the dell version of windows in favor of a dual boot w/ 2 m2 drive (2tb for windows, 512g for ubuntu), reinstalled windows 11 and... i no longer have a windows hello compliant camera so i cant unlock with facial recognition. (device manager shows a \"generic webcam\" x2...) any recommendations on where to find the correct drivers for the built in webcam? dell xps 9710... (happy to supply further details if theyre needed) edit: i never thought it from this side was so condescending... that being said, i\\'ve tried the \\'dell\\' approach, i\\'m asking for assistance past that point... ok... since the recommendations this far have been... rudimentary... let\\'s assume i\\'ve done the bare minimum to get the proper drivers installed... i\\'ve used dells support system (both automatic and manual) to \\'update\\' the webcam drivers. this far, that has not resolved the issue... tl;dr: stop suggesting the fucking simple resolutions, i\\'ve tried them... move on... stop being dicks and offer actual solutions. hey! doesn\\'t these scores look far too low for i9-12900hk?i did notice a huge thermal throttling so i\\'m thinking about repasting with tg kryonaut. what scores did you manage to reach guys? https://preview.redd.it/h2x3m1n6y9e91.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45927c111094317df2c3231a4b31055bdd0cd2c \\u200b \\u200b

on forums. i have not noticed a couple new apps until now. killer intel center and maxxaudiopro. are these legit? i only update through dell supportassist after experience with getting generic drivers from nvidia etc. lots of borks with lenovo and asus. do you recommend keeping these two or something else? i want to get a powerbank so i can charge my machine while i\\'m driving or while it\\'s in my backpack and i\\'m waiting to go to another class. i\\'m looking at the 50,000 mah crave 2 power bank. anyone have another suggestion for a lighter power bank that can also do the job? another one i\\'m considering is power-add. the next accessory is a bag that is waterproof/resistant and has a specific place to store a power bank that can charge my 17\" laptop while it is just in my backpack. i am in an area that rains 260+ days out of the year so water resistance is necessary. any suggestions? thank you. the app was \"dell (something)\" the symbol was like a speedometer/internet speedtest looking type of icon - i uninstalled it thinking i remembered the name and no bueno , i thought it was dell performance? or something like that but google results say it\\'s a no, and i couldn\\'t find a list for stock dell apps for this. it was a gauge looking icon and i just want to make sure i don\\'t need it. appreciate it. i’m proably the only person putting a screen proptector on my laptop lmao i am trying to squeeze the most performance out my my xps 13 9305 (i5 1135g7, 8gb, 256gb), but the fans never seem to spin up very high, even though the laptop is pinned at 100 degrees and the clocks are dropping. i already have the \"high performance\" preset enabled in dell power manager. any other suggestions? i have a xps 13 9300 4k display and was wondering if the 9310 4k display is any better or is it the same quality? xps 15 9520 i switched power profile to standard and laptop was charging when powered off. i will keep playing with this. i did not uninstall and reinstall drivers for battery like dell support told me to do. i am trying to find documentation for the profiles. will look in owner’s manual. can someone who owns an xps 13 plus (specifically) please post a picture showing it open as far as the hinge allows? thanks in advance! not an option for mosr people to be honest hi everyone. i decided to move back to windows from mac after more than 12 years. this is a rant and im not trying to start fires here but if anyone can comment on any of the issues ive outlined id be super greatfull. i figured id buy the mac equivalant, best windows laptop etc etc. boy oh boy. 2 days have passed and i am still unable to abandon mac as i simply cant set up the laptop. outlook is abysmally bad. i understand feature wise its rich but its so slow. im indexing emails. 8 hours today went from 160k down to 110k. laptop and bios are all fully updated. but lets assume this is just windows. four finger “alt-tab” or whatever its called in windows is stupid laggy. like i was showing the laptop off to colleagues and they were thats not good. laptop is in performance mode, dell cooling preset etc etc. ive tried restarting multiple times but cant seem to solve it. my trackpad isnt on equal height. gonna try to solve this via warranty. havent had much experience with the battery but initial impressions are that it isnt great. again cant talk numbers but % goes down fast. so much for intel efficiency cores. cooling - dont know details but sucking air from bottom is annoying if placing laptop on anything but a flat surface. on macbooks thats not the case. speakers are definitelly not apple quality. the whole laptop vibrates and they feel artificially loud. things i like: build quality apart from my trackpad issue is good. love the oled touch screen. always wanted a touch screen laptop and works great. windows hello is convenient. other than this i dont have much else to say. im praying i manage to sort these issues out because this is an expensive laptop and one of the reasons i went for it is precisely because i wanted to avoid all this windows buggy bullsht. i cant decide if im dissapointed yet as again im hopeful i will manage to sort these issues out but initial impressions are definitely not what i expected. i have a new xps 15 (9520) with windows 11 pro. something odd is happening when the laptop comes out of sleep. it will take about 20-30 seconds for it to freeze and not react to for example pressing the windows key to open the start menu. all the other open programs do work because you can alt-tab to them. it also seems wifi will be down for that first period and graphics are also not playing (can\\'t stream netflix or use whatsapp desktop). then once that freeze has past after about 10-20 seconds the laptop is just normal again. i don\\'t know whether it\\'s a windows (11) problem or something with the dell. i have the laptop on performance mode, and have no idea what i can still try for it to get fixed. anyone experiencing the same or has some ideas? hi. i have a new xps 9315 running win11 with bitlocker enabled. when i switch the xps on, i get challenged to enter my bitlocker passcode which i do and then press enter. the machine then displays “xps” on the screen before powering off. the second time i do this,the machine boots to windows. this is recreatable. same thing happens on a trial xps plus. is anyone else running bitlocker on an xps? we run bitlocker on 400+ latitudes with no problems. a few days ago my 1 yr old xps15 did it\\'s usual thing of powering off for a windows update but at the same time i noticed it also did a dell firmware update - 0.1.10.1 and since then i\\'ve discovered 2 major issues. the wifi connection has been awful - very slow, dropping in and out etc, so bad it was making the laptop unuseable, especially for my work. i did some digging around and it wasn\\'t using the wifi 6 (11ax) connection to my ubiquiti ap. have sort of got that working by changing the netwrok adaptor properties to use 5ghz band and it now is back to how it was. the other problem i have, which i only discovered today as not needed to print anything recently, is that i can\\'t print from any programs. installed printers are not recognized, even the ms print to pdf one and when i try and reinstall my hp printer i get an error sayiong no drivers are available. both of these issues must be to do with the firmware update. i\\'m going to contact dell tomorrow anyway but just wondered if anyone had any similar issues or any helpful pointers so i don\\'t get fobbed off by dell support. thanks im trying to sell a maxxed out xps 13 9310 but nobody on facebook marketplace seems to care about it. las time i tried to sell something using ebay i couldnt post cause my paypal account cant be used because my bank isnt recognized by them. so i\\'m considering the xps 9720 intended for heavy use of the adobe suite, but i would like advice regarding the configuration. thus i am opting for the 32gb ram for sure, and now i have to choose between the i9 and i7 options. note that i haven\\'t found any solid arguments against the 4k screen by reading the sub, apart from its impact on battery life ofc. the main reason i don\\'t want to go full spec i9 & rtx 3060 that i am fearful of the impact they would have on battery life (i am ok if it lasts 6hrs), as well as the potential overkill. considering this, should i maybe go with the i7-3060 combo or even i7-3050? also i believe that the vapor chamber is an excellent feature to have. from what i am reading here however, there is an uncertainty regarding to which configurations it applies. has anyone got an answer on that? so what do you suggest? does your experience differ from what is already posted on the sub? my xps 13 plus (9320) does not sleep or turn off the display when the lid is closed. i have the power setting set to \"sleep\" when the lid is closed on battery power. i have tried switching this setting to hibernate and power off, but neither has worked. this seemingly suggests that the laptop doesn\\'t know when it\\'s closed. is this an issue that could be fixed in software, or do i have a faulty unit? hello everyone, i\\'m probably going to order this laptop within the next few hours. i just wanted to ask how everyone\\'s experience with this laptop was and if it was a worth-it purchase in your opinion. also, i want to get ask whether to get the 3.5k version or the uhd+, i want the best-looking screen, so i\\'m just confused on which one to get out of those. thanks for the help. hello, i would like to know if it possible to disable intel graphics gpu on the dell xps 9510 ? indeed, apparently intel gpu can cause eyestrain and temporal dithering. i want to give it a try and see if there is some change after disabling the intel gpu. the goal is to run on discrete graphics (nvidia gpu) thanks a lot, is there any way to solve the full speed fans issue? i got the xps 9305 with windows 10 pro. everytime its plugged in, the fans start spinning on full speed every few minuted. especially when watching videos or even worse when watching live streams on youtube. hi, i repasted my xps 9520 with kpx thermal paste and there are my cinebench r23 results. i gained almost 20% on the multi score performance for the same uv & pl1/pl2 limits & fan profile (-160mv voltage offset - 120w pl1/pl2 - cool). i use xtu to undervolt and to change pl1/pl2 limits. before: 14600 multi score - thermal throttleling (+95°c) at 70w. dropping to 45-55w at the end of the benchmark. before repaste after: 17250 multi score - thermal throttleling (+95°c) at 110w. dropping to 90w at the end of the benchmark. note that +18000 should still possible with per-core tuning. after respaste the single score after respaste is a bit low because it went into idle for 10 sec before i noticed it, should be in the +1900. fyi, this is equivalent to a stock 12600k inside a thin premium laptop. pretty cool stuff from intel and dell :) . otherwise, my idle temperatures dropped from 45°c to 35°c. i would totally recommend doing it as it\\'s not difficult even for a novice. xps 9520 - 12900hk - 32gb ddr5 - uhd+ display advertised as 8 hours of web surfing...i get about 3 hours. i mainly use microsoft office software and the web, no videos, no games. beyond doing a clean install, is there anything i can manually remove to increase my battery life? on task manager, i see that supportassistagent.exe and dell instrumentation takes up the most background memory, with mcafee right behind it. anyone have any suggestions? i\\'ve read a lot of tips about battery care, and most sites and videos recommend keeping the battery between 40-80%. i just got my xps 13 plus, but i was wondering whether it\\'d be very bad for the battery if i kept it unplugged between something like 15-95%? reason being that the device\\'s battery life isn\\'t very long, and if possible, i want to last the work day (8-9h) without having to charge it back up. using it from 95% to 15% and charging it only when i arrive home helps me to do that, but the 40-80 rule means i basically must use my charger everyday. received my 9510 a week ago. the trackpad has a big problem: it \"unklicks\" only after up to 1-2 seconds. i.e. you press the button, the click is recognized, but the trackpad does not mechanically \"release\" until a bit of time. this is especially problematic for\\u200d drag-and-drop or scroll operations. has anyone experienced the same issue? my unit will go back to dell for repair/replacement :-( so i\\'ve been experiencing thermal throttling as many with my dell xps 9520 - i7 12700h. typical solutions for this type of system unstabilities are to undervolt the cpu and/or re-pasting the cpu. ideally both if your laptop has a poor heat dissipation design (as for the xps 9520, and the previous versions). the need for re-pasting i was aware of dell thermal paste poor quality and application so i went for the repasting first, to see how it could improve the system stability (clocks, voltage, power which are directly governed by thermal performance) and because repasting has been successful at it for the previous generation of xps (e.g. 9510/9570), outstandingly dropping thermals by 10-20°c. the thermal paste most of re-pasting you\\'ll find online using non-liquid metal pastes are done with either thermal grizzly kryonaut or artic mx-5. from the benchmarks i saw, the kryonaut is constantly giving the top results in terms of thermals even in front of its sister the kryonaut extreme. so i went with the kryonaut. the outcome re-pasting completed, i immediately ran a \"stress test\" of the cpu using aida 64. before re-pasting, i was experiencing thermal throttling reaching 100°c on almost all p-cores, and subsequent clock drops happening periodically during the test. after the re-pasting, as the thermals dropped by 10°c under stress test, no more clock drops but stable performances (thermals and clocks) during the 20 minute test. when doing my usual activities, i immediately felt (fans and heat) and monitored the difference, and especially when watching 2 video streams in parallel, asking a bit of cpu capacity, while having 10 tabs google chrome tabs opened: i witnessed a global cpu temp (mean of p-cores temps) of 70-75°c at most when, before re-pasting, it was reaching the throttling threshold at 96-100°c. i bought an open-box dell xps 9510 and am loving it. it has 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, 1 thunderbolt 3 port (as well as an sd and audio port). when i try to connect my asus ve278 / ve278h monitors however, i can\\'t get them to connect. for one i use a benefei hdmi to usb-3 dongle with no luck. i tried direct connections to both tb 3 and 4 ports with no luck. is this a cable issue (e.g. do i need to buy an hdmi to thunderbolt 4 cable) for these monitors to work? or, must i buy new 4k monitors? i can get the monitors in a month or so but, have plenty of work to do and am having a tough time using only my notebook screen. thanks! i bought a xps 15 9510 last week directly from dell. over the weekend i noticed a few issues with my unit. is that a common problem with quality control on dell laptops? the motherboard doesn\\'t seem to be seated right because the right usb-c port is blocked a bit by the frame. if i try to insert a usb-c dongle i either have to really force it and scratch the frame or i can\\'t get it in there at all. i also have wifi issues. generally the speed is by a third lower compared to my thinkpad and if i download large files the connection is interrupted multiple times. i\\'ve been looking for a well rounded laptop to replace my aging 13\" spectre, will mostly be used for content consumption and light gaming (lol is about all really). i noticed over the weekend bestbuy had the xps 15 9510 with 3.5k oled, i7 11800h, 16gb, 1tb, and 3050 ti in arctic white on clearance, then noticed a \"certified - excellent\" open box for $1200 and pulled the trigger. i won\\'t be gaming on it enough to warrant an actual gaming laptop, and from reviews it seems this would be idea for movies given the screen and speaker set up. i do see some issue that concern me, heating and throttling being the main ones. i\\'m not too concerned about battery life but would like to be able to browse the web around the house without it toasting my legs. given the price and features, do you think this is worth the shortcomings, or should i cancel my order and keep searching? hello i have had my xps 17 for a few months now but no amount of bios and driver updates seems to stop it having the fans on almost all the time, even just when browsing the web. i have set the power profile from the dell control center app to optimised, but honestly changing between any of the existing profiles doesn\\'t seem to make any difference. additionally, when trying to play a game on it it runs really really hot despite the loud fans. having had it for just a few months i doubt that it\\'s dust inside it... anyone found any good hacks to manage the emissions on this thing? my hp finally gave out after almost ten years. been looking for another laptop for about a year now. found a 9510 for a good deal a pulled the trigger. no wobble but there is the hinge issue. maybe try to get dell to fix but not a deal breaker for me. looking into upgrading memory, skin, plug covers, and a case. i would’ve liked a xps 17 but couldn’t pass up this deal. if you cover every key on your keyboard with your palms, does the rattling stop? if so, it means that you have some keys that slightly lose and are resonating at certain frequencies to the type of audio, albeit music/videos. there isn\\'t really much of a fix to it other than trying to get dell to replace your keyboard deck under warranty. if it\\'s not the keys, it\\'s probably the damping material in the speakers resonating with the audio due to it being a faulty part that doesn\\'t have enough of the damper in it. probably should get that replaced through warranty if that\\'s the case. has anyone found a solution to cover the cameras on the xps 15 9520 or xps 17 9720? with the beveled edge the usual stick-on camera covers aren\\'t an option. i\\'d like something better than a folded post-it or painter\\'s tape. dell diagnostics. full test. first time both intel and nvidia 3050 failed test. second time intel passed nvidia did not. i wonder, was the test expecting input from me, screen looks ok or not? i cannot seem to find detailed results. not sure what/why failed. this could be a non issue or could tell me there is a problem with gpu. this is a refurbished system. i think i have 30 days to return it. i have on-site service but if this is a real problem i would prefer to swap system as i expect gpu is on the motherboard. any other video testing apps that you would recommend? hi all, as a follow-up to my latest post here, i\\'ve got some final remarks to share. tldr; i had re-pasted the cpu with liquid metal and the gpu with kryo extreme. the 12700h can, in no way i know, be undervolted :( if i would\\'ve known this from the beginning, i would have forked out the extra 300 euro for the 12900hk, but that ship has sailed. i have tried to change the values in the bios using the method described before by brendan greenly, and by this nice fellow. i have found and changed the following values: cfg lock: 0x43 to 0x0 overclocking lock: 0x10e to 0x0 overclocking feature: 0x1d9 to 0x1 (have tried with this on and off) (p-core) offset prefix: 0x1e2 to 0x1 (for minus) p-core voltage offset: 0x1e0 to 0x50 (for -0.80 mv) (cluster 0) offset prefix: 0x31d to 0x1 (for minus) cluster 0 voltage offset: 0x315 to 0x50 (for -0.80 mv) (cluster 1) offset prefix: 0x31e to 0x1 (for minus) cluster 1 voltage offset: 0x317 to 0x50 (for -0.80 mv) i\\'ve tried switching bios virtualization support on and off to no avail. so i went to look into the pl1 and pl2 settings. it seems like that the stock pl2 is set to 115w, and a duration of 128(?) seconds, the result is instant thermal throttling. the pl1 seems to have been set at 75w, but somehow, once it slams the 100c during the pl2 \\'window\\', the pl1 seems to kick down to 45w, basically smothering all the power. with the re-paste and stock pl1 and pl2 settings, i could get a xtu 2.0 benchmark of around 5000 and a cinebench r23 score of 12000. investigating further, i\\'ve found this topic online here on the 12700h. i got throttlestop, and after some fiddling with values, it seems that for my setup this yielded the best results: pl1: 80w (+ clamp) pl2: 95w (+ clamp) turbo time limit (pl2 time limit): 14 seconds. sync mmio locked everything after (don\\'t know to what effect) made throttlestop start with windows using this method, since the values are reset to default after a reboot. the effect was, that instead of ramming into the thermal throttle of 100c at 115w within an instant, the cpu now quickly heats up towards 100c, reaches 100c at around 14 seconds, then switches to 80w. temp shortly falls a bit below 100c until also the heatsink heats up and then stabilizes at full load, 100c at 78w. this gave me a score of around 6000 vs 5000 in intel xtu 2.0 (+20%), and a full 10 minute cinebench r23 run scoring 16000 point versus the old 12000 (+33%). if you are going to re-paste and not aim straight for the edge, i\\'d advise a pl2 of 90w, (ttl maybe for 16 sec) and a pl of 75w. these values maybe only \\'score\\' good, because, benchmarks are no real world use. but at least i got rid of the laptop going into limp-performance during the ridiculous 115w turbo boost and long time window. i might fiddle a bit more with the pl1 and pl2 values in the future, but at least i got her to perform a whole lot better now.

of flex on the bottom panel of the xps plus as i\\'m getting near the exhaust? short video of the \"issue\" here: https://imgur.com/7vbklju when i first got the laptop there was a weird bump on the bottom panel near the exhausts, which i pressed on and something clicked. but it seems something is off, i can press in the bottom panel and it doesn\\'t look completely straight when look at it. i\\'ve opened it up but can\\'t really find if there\\'s something it should be clicking into to prevent it from flexing? hi all, i have a dell xps 13 9310 and i\\'m wanting to run two monitors (yet to be purchased) and still be able to plug in 4 usb-a devices. what would be the best solution and parts required for this? i did some research but still really confused about what i\\'d need to purchase. thanks in advance! hello, guys! i have ordered my xps 13 plus! however, my friend told me that i should buy razer blade 14 with higher performance in same cost😧 can anyone help me persuading my friend to buy xps😂 i have the dell xps 9510 and my bluetooth audio is stuttering, breaking up. anyone else having that issue? i am using the airpods gen 3. doesn\\'t matter if i am watching netflix, youtube etc. i am looking for a tb4 dock for my xps 15 (9520 with 3050 ti). i have dell d6000 dock which provides just 65w of pd and my laptop gives a notice of \"low pd source\" when i plug into this. if i use demanding apps while plugged in, it can actually discharge faster than it charges. has anybody come across a tb4 dock out there with 86w pd for this laptop? i have heard of ac adapters before which could boost the pd of my exisiting d6000 dock, does anybody have any experience with this? dell xps 15 9520 (i7-12700h, 32gb, nvidia geforce rtx 3050 ti) i am just ensuring i have my adobe apps set up properly with my laptop and getting the best performance out of it. the adobe apps i have (lightroom, premiere pro, photoshop, indesign, aftereffects) are not appearing in the geforce experience application. in the past, i owned a huawei laptop with a nvidia geforce mx150 dgpu and these adobe apps did appear in the dashboard and i could manage their settings through the gfe program. why are they not appearing? is this an indication that they are not in fact making use out of the nvidia gpu installed in my laptop, even though i have selected the dgpu in the respective preferences module in each of these apps? the apps are all installed as part of my subscription to adobe and are not cracked versions. are you plugged in? what\\'s your performance mode setting in windows? whats the cooling performance set to in the bios? the behavior your describing could be expected depending on the circumstances. both the cpu and gpu cannot run full tilt (don\\'t expect over 4ghz on the cpu when the gpu is stressing) this is a normal occurrence. when the total dynamic power demands exceed the power available, then the cpu will reduce power. it says contact dell for replacement after diags. say what? anyone else see this? of course , i got the i9 12900hk with rtx 3060 ...i love it after owning and loving my early model xps 13 for more than 8 years i decided it was time for an upgrade and went with the xps plus 13 9320 with 32gb/1tb/uhd on a best buy sale for $1695. it looks absolutely perfect. the weight, finish, screen, integrated trackpad etc… drool worthy. issues started though from the moment i turned it on. even just setting up the system, the bottom got incredibly hot. i tried measuring how hot with a thermal health thermometer but the max it goes is 110 degrees and it was beyond that. i’d compare it to a hot dashboard in the sun. i tried everything. all the updates. running it on a flat surface. calling support. etc. dell support’s options were: have a tech come to my house to try to replace the fan (the fan functioned and showed no issues when tested) switch to a mode that throttled performance and kept the fans running constantly (i was in balanced mode before) send a replacement device in 3.5 weeks. i decided to return it to best buy and try again. best buy was great about the return. the 2nd xps came 3 days later. with this one, heat levels were just the same, and the left speaker sound was distorted. as much as i wanted to love it, i just couldn’t justify the expense for a space heater i wouldn’t even be able to use sitting on my couch. i immediately boxed and returned it to best buy. i’ve seen many say it runs hot. even if it’s on a desk i can’t imagine the levels of heat i was seeing would be good in the long term. one other issue was the haptic track pad. while i only used it for a few days, issues with click and drag happened enough to be an annoyance. the motion also lagged a few times when just editing a basic powerpoint. the machine was beautiful, and as much as i wanted to love it, i wouldn’t recommend the xps 13 plus for any purpose.. i hope others have more positive experiences. i was 0 for 2 and sadly turned into an 8 year fan boy gone sour. hello! i\\'ve spent far too much time trying to solve the xps 15 9520\\'s power throttling under combined cpu + gpu loads (specifically, the cpu dropping to <15w and sub-1ghz while gaming), so i\\'ve decided to share my solution around to hopefully help other owners out. video here [this is - by far - better than the text version, imo] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r3wshdqsvy tl:dw? ...no, the text version is a little long too, but here you go: you’ll need to download a copy of throttlestop to carry out the steps to control power throttling. download here: https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/ please note that throttlestop settings are reset when the system is power cycled so you’ll need to reopen the app after starting up the system to make sure they’re applied. alternatively, you can set up task scheduler to automatically run the program on login. firstly, a quick warning. the xps 9520 has introduced a sheet of plastic sandwiched between the heatsink assembly and the motherboard. based on my own testing, this is a thermal insulator, which has most likely been placed there to reduce the temperature of the bottom case by a few degrees. this could have been ok, except the plastic is actually directly covering the mosfets for the cpu and gpu voltage regulators. on my unit, the poor application of this plastic sheet had pushed the thermal pad for the gpu mosfets up and away from what it was supposed to be cooling. not good. the thermal pads on the rear of the cooler are supposed to be making direct, uninterrupted contact with the parts they are intended to cool. dell’s decision to shove an insulating layer in between is bafflingly ill-advised, but with the standard heavy power throttling behaviour intact, it’s still likely that mosfet temperatures are remaining within their rated limits. i’m not necessarily going to recommend tearing your brand new computer apart just to remove this plastic, but i will warn you that i don’t know what the long-term effect of running the cpu and gpu at full wattage will be on those mosfets with the plastic still in place. it is completely fair to assume that it won’t be good for them. please keep in mind that i have removed the plastic from this xps and repasted the chips with kryonaut before making any changes to the behaviour of the power delivery. the first and most important thing you need to know is that the xps can’t adequately cool itself while sitting flat on a hard or soft surface. the gpu is set to start thermal throttling at only 74 degrees, so even after following all the steps in this video, you’ll see the rtx 3050 throttling like crazy almost immediately if the laptop isn’t elevated on a ventilated stand or cooling pad. a fairly unusual feature in many of dell’s products is motion-based power throttling. this uses an accelerometer embedded in the intel chipset to tell the machine when it’s been picked up or moved, and a hard power throttle will kick in on both the cpu and gpu which can take quite a while to go away. to sort this out, head into device manager. expand the sub-section called system devices. now, locate “intel integrated sensor solution”. right click on this, then click on disable device. when prompted, click on yes. it’s best to restart the computer now to make sure this takes effect. right, let’s tackle that power throttling. assuming you haven’t removed the plastic from underneath the cooling solution, the following is (i believe) the best course of action: first up, we’re going to get the power delivery under control while keeping temperatures as low as possible. please use this method if you haven’t removed the insulating plastic from under your heatsink assembly. as you may be aware, these systems feature nvidia dynamic boost, which shifts power from the cpu over to the gpu depending on load. we’re going to disable this feature to lock the graphics chip at 35 watts of power, down from the maximum of 45 watts it will use from the factory. the effect on temperatures is significant. jump back into device manager. open the sub-section called software devices. look for “nvidia platform controllers and framework”. right click on this, then click disable device. click yes when prompted. you won’t need to restart the computer for this to take effect so we’ll move on to the next step. now open up throttlestop. just click ok to shoo the warning away. from the main window, click on the button labelled “tpl” towards the bottom right. you’ll see the turbo power limits window appear. first, uncheck the checkbox next to disable controls. change the number next to long power pl1 to 35. this will force your processor to stay at or below 35 watts under long workloads. you might want to also reduce short power pl2 to somewhere around 65 watts. this will keep temperatures more under control during a shorter workload. now click the checkbox labelled lock on the right, then hit apply. \\u200b alternatively, if you’ve removed that plastic from the cooler and you’re running the system in a fairly low-temperature environment, you might want to turn things up as far as the cooling system can handle. no problem – we can set the system to run at a combined load of 85 watts shared between the cpu and gpu without power throttling. please note that you might see some thermal throttling on the gpu since it can occasionally bump into its 74-degree throttling limit with this setup. firstly, open up throttlestop. click ok at the warning. from the main window, click on the button labelled “tpl” towards the bottom right. you’ll see the turbo power limits window appear. first, uncheck the checkbox next to disable controls. change the number next to long power pl1 to 45. this will force your processor to stay at or below 45 watts under long workloads. you might want to also reduce short power pl2 to somewhere around 65 to 75 watts. this will keep temperatures more under control during a shorter workload. now click the checkbox labelled lock on the right. additionally, since we’re going to be running the system fairly hard which will prompt dell’s proprietary power control firmware to intervene, you’ll need to click the lock button to the right of mmio up the top. now click apply, and we’re done. if you are having issues with the gpu thermal throttling, try backing the cpu pl1 power off by another 5 watts in throttlestop. \\u200b whichever method you used - you should now be able to enjoy hours of gameplay completely uninterrupted by heavy throttling! i was looking forward to the 3050ti for my photo end video editing hobby, but being honest to myself, i think i can perfectly survive with the 3050 and finish tougher projects in my desktop (3800x cpu+6900xt gpu). yet, given the weaker graphics i would think is fair to obtain some compensation also thinking of resale value if i were to sell it down the road. how much you think it would be fair? if it matters, this is a xps 9520 12700h, 3.5koled, 16gb ram. so, i have a xps 15 9520 with win 11 home on it, and i absolutely loathe it, ive used setallback and the looks are...ok at the moment, but there is just so much bloat and shit i cant stand, so i am considering a downgrade to win 10!! thing is, ive heard multiple stories searching reddit that spans from \"wifi drives wont work\" to \"battery life will suck\" to \"everything is just fine and dandy\" so i kinda wanted to hear if anyone has some experiences to share about this, cause i will rather suffer in misery than say fuck up the battery life or some shit, but if i can help it, id much prefer downgrading to win 10! i bought a new xps15 9510 (configured with 32 gb of ram) in feb 22. quickly realized i wished i had gone with 64 gb (i\\'m a video editor). anyhow, i recently upgraded and want to sell the 2 x 16 gb ram. dm me if interested. with no 3.5mm jack and both my usb c ports in use, i am looking for a wireless earphones. i have airpods but i dont really love the way they work with windows. the other option is to buy a usb c hub, which is definitely expensive. please help! i don’t have dellxps, but i am really considering to buy one. i’m former windows user but i switched to mac. now i need a compatible computer for my studies, so windows is mandatory. i really like dellxps because of the quality and… well everything else what that laptop represents. so the question is this: how does dellxps (with rtx3050 ti 4gb) work well (for a student) when using autocad, revit and other 3d modeling programs? is 4gb gpu memory enough? also should i buy base model? is fhd good or should i upgrade to higher resolution? can i upgrade ram or ssd by my self? english is not my native so sorry for errors hello everyone, i\\'m from belgium and i\\'ve been trying to buy the xps 13 plus on the dell website for several days. normally when i go to the belgian site, the computer doesn\\'t seem to be available, it doesn\\'t even appear on the website. but when i do a google search such as \"xps 13 plus belgïe\", i find this link: https://www.dell.com/nl-be/shop/dell-laptops-en-notebooks/nieuw-xps-13-plus/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/bn93327cb. \\u200b however, when i try to put the computer in my cart, it starts to load endlessly. i have already tried to contact dell but i can\\'t talk to anyone who has access to the belgian sales. the chat is inaccessible and when i call the number indicated on the website, i go through automatic responses that tell me to go to the website. so here are some questions: has anyone from belgium managed to get someone on line why can\\'t i put the computer in my shopping cart why belgium is one of the only countries in europe where the xps is not available \\u200b thanks to those who can help me guys should i buy fhd (as it\\'s non-touch and 500nits) or the oled? i\\'m just a student going for college so the colors wouldn\\'t matter much to me and i would only stream movies and shows if that\\'s the case no video editing or anything. what do you recommend? i know this has been posted before but i wanted to also share my own experience. i can easily get this machine to throttle down to 400mhz by playing a 4k netflix movie in the app for about 10 minutes. hwinfo shows core power limit exceeded even thought the cpu temps are well within acceptable range (45 - 55 degrees). what\\'s strange is that i can prevent throttling by muting the speaker, so i am wondering if the extra power needed to drive the speakers is pushing the power delivery over the edge? this happens across all dell power profiles, on batter or plugged in. it\\'s a real shame because i do like this pc (except the battery life) but will likely return it since i am still within the window. any suggestions of course welcome. xps 9720 with 12th gen i7 64gb ddr5 geforce 3060 6gb 1tb ssd along with the 4k touch display and windows 11 pro. would this be the perfect choice for a software engineer looking to buy a laptop for coding (mainly ml stuff) and a little bit of gaming? if not, why not and what else would you recommend? i just bought a new dell xps 15 9510. i know there have been a lot of different issues with the touchpad. my touchpad isn\\'t loose anywhere and seems to respond well in use. the lower third of the touchpad does decrease slightly when pressed with my finger and \"clicks\" (very shallow and slight sound). it\\'s as if it was a right or left button on some older models. the upper third of the touchpad does not have the same clicking pattern, but simply responds to a (one) touch of my finger. is this a normal function for the entire touchpad (meaning the click on the lower third)? or should there be no clicking at all on the touchpad? thanks in advance for any feedback. so, i have a xps 15 9520 with win 11 home on it, and i absolutely loathe it, ive used

the xps 15 9520\\'s power throttling under combined cpu + gpu loads (specifically, the cpu dropping to <15w and sub-1ghz while gaming), so i\\'ve decided to share my solution around to hopefully help other owners out. video here [this is - by far - better than the text version, imo] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r3wshdqsvy tl:dw? ...no, the text version is a little long too, but here you go: you’ll need to download a copy of throttlestop to carry out the steps to control power throttling. download here: https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/ please note that throttlestop settings are reset when the system is power cycled so you’ll need to reopen the app after starting up the system to make sure they’re applied. alternatively, you can set up task scheduler to automatically run the program on login. firstly, a quick warning. the xps 9520 has introduced a sheet of plastic sandwiched between the heatsink assembly and the motherboard. based on my own testing, this is a thermal insulator, which has most likely been placed there to reduce the temperature of the bottom case by a few degrees. this could have been ok, except the plastic is actually directly covering the mosfets for the cpu and gpu voltage regulators. on my unit, the poor application of this plastic sheet had pushed the thermal pad for the gpu mosfets up and away from what it was supposed to be cooling. not good. the thermal pads on the rear of the cooler are supposed to be making direct, uninterrupted contact with the parts they are intended to cool. dell’s decision to shove an insulating layer in between is bafflingly ill-advised, but with the standard heavy power throttling behaviour intact, it’s still likely that mosfet temperatures are remaining within their rated limits. i’m not necessarily going to recommend tearing your brand new computer apart just to remove this plastic, but i will warn you that i don’t know what the long-term effect of running the cpu and gpu at full wattage will be on those mosfets with the plastic still in place. it is completely fair to assume that it won’t be good for them. please keep in mind that i have removed the plastic from this xps and repasted the chips with kryonaut before making any changes to the behaviour of the power delivery. the first and most important thing you need to know is that the xps can’t adequately cool itself while sitting flat on a hard or soft surface. the gpu is set to start thermal throttling at only 74 degrees, so even after following all the steps in this video, you’ll see the rtx 3050 throttling like crazy almost immediately if the laptop isn’t elevated on a ventilated stand or cooling pad. a fairly unusual feature in many of dell’s products is motion-based power throttling. this uses an accelerometer embedded in the intel chipset to tell the machine when it’s been picked up or moved, and a hard power throttle will kick in on both the cpu and gpu which can take quite a while to go away. to sort this out, head into device manager. expand the sub-section called system devices. now, locate “intel integrated sensor solution”. right click on this, then click on disable device. when prompted, click on yes. it’s best to restart the computer now to make sure this takes effect. right, let’s tackle that power throttling. assuming you haven’t removed the plastic from underneath the cooling solution, the following is (i believe) the best course of action: first up, we’re going to get the power delivery under control while keeping temperatures as low as possible. please use this method if you haven’t removed the insulating plastic from under your heatsink assembly. as you may be aware, these systems feature nvidia dynamic boost, which shifts power from the cpu over to the gpu depending on load. we’re going to disable this feature to lock the graphics chip at 35 watts of power, down from the maximum of 45 watts it will use from the factory. the effect on temperatures is significant. jump back into device manager. open the sub-section called software devices. look for “nvidia platform controllers and framework”. right click on this, then click disable device. click yes when prompted. you won’t need to restart the computer for this to take effect so we’ll move on to the next step. now open up throttlestop. just click ok to shoo the warning away. from the main window, click on the button labelled “tpl” towards the bottom right. you’ll see the turbo power limits window appear. first, uncheck the checkbox next to disable controls. change the number next to long power pl1 to 35. this will force your processor to stay at or below 35 watts under long workloads. you might want to also reduce short power pl2 to somewhere around 65 watts. this will keep temperatures more under control during a shorter workload. now click the checkbox labelled lock on the right, then hit apply. \\u200b alternatively, if you’ve removed that plastic from the cooler and you’re running the system in a fairly low-temperature environment, you might want to turn things up as far as the cooling system can handle. no problem – we can set the system to run at a combined load of 85 watts shared between the cpu and gpu without power throttling. please note that you might see some thermal throttling on the gpu since it can occasionally bump into its 74-degree throttling limit with this setup. firstly, open up throttlestop. click ok at the warning. from the main window, click on the button labelled “tpl” towards the bottom right. you’ll see the turbo power limits window appear. first, uncheck the checkbox next to disable controls. change the number next to long power pl1 to 45. this will force your processor to stay at or below 45 watts under long workloads. you might want to also reduce short power pl2 to somewhere around 65 to 75 watts. this will keep temperatures more under control during a shorter workload. now click the checkbox labelled lock on the right. additionally, since we’re going to be running the system fairly hard which will prompt dell’s proprietary power control firmware to intervene, you’ll need to click the lock button to the right of mmio up the top. now click apply, and we’re done. if you are having issues with the gpu thermal throttling, try backing the cpu pl1 power off by another 5 watts in throttlestop. \\u200b whichever method you used - you should now be able to enjoy hours of gameplay completely uninterrupted by heavy throttling! hello everyone, i\\'m from belgium and i\\'ve been trying to buy the xps 13 plus on the dell website for several days. normally when i go to the belgian site, the computer doesn\\'t seem to be available, it doesn\\'t even appear on the website. but when i do a google search such as \"xps 13 plus belgïe\", i find this link: https://www.dell.com/nl-be/shop/dell-laptops-en-notebooks/nieuw-xps-13-plus/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/bn93327cb. \\u200b however, when i try to put the computer in my cart, it starts to load endlessly. i have already tried to contact dell but i can\\'t talk to anyone who has access to the belgian sales. the chat is inaccessible and when i call the number indicated on the website, i go through automatic responses that tell me to go to the website. so here are some questions: has anyone from belgium managed to get someone on line why can\\'t i put the computer in my shopping cart why belgium is one of the only countries in europe where the xps is not available \\u200b thanks to those who can help me i have these installed and working fine. the first boot took about a minute before i saw the dell logo. crucial 64gb (2 x 32gb) 262-pin ddr5 so-dimm ddr5 4800 (pc4 38400) laptop memory model ct2k32g48c40s5 check for bios

much info on it. one website says it\\'s a usb dongle driver and another says it\\'s part of aladdin hasp, which is some sort of \"software protection\". i don\\'t have anything connected the the usb

38wn95c-w ultrawide monitor via the provided thunderbolt cable. the monitor is not being detected for video display. the monitor acts as if it is not connected to a laptop. the interesting thing is that the monitor has a hub on it where i have plugged in a usb mouse and when the thunderbolt connection is made, the mouse is available to the laptop. therefore, i know the physical connection is being made. laptop specs: - core i7 12th gen - 64 gb crucial ddr5 ram - rtx 3060 troubleshooting steps i have done: - updated bios from dell support site - updated thunderbolt controller drivers from dell support site - enabled / re-enabled both thunderbolt controllers - confirmed that the monitor works via usb c to hdmi converter that is provided with the xps laptop - confirmed that the monitor works via a regular display port cable connected to a lenovo usb c hub that i have connected to the xps laptop. i don\\'t plan to use this hub, but i tried it as a troubleshooting step. please note that i have confirmed this monitor works via the provided thunderbolt cable when connecting it to my lenovo x1 carbon. any help or ideas would definitely be appreciated. thanks! i\\'m in the market to purchase one of these to run linux and use as my dev machine and battery life is very important but so is the screen for more screen real estate and occasional content consumtpion. ideally, i would be happy with a 2k screen but fhd and uhd are the options for these models. oddly enough, most posts about the battery life are people just giving vague estimates or if its precise, they fail to mention the screen type (which is the biggest power draw) so please give precise numbers/ranges. ballparks like \"good\" or \"bad\" don\\'t say anything. please use the template below. hours: ? screen type: uhd/fhd model: one of the ones in the title battery size: 57w, 86w, 97w operating system: windows vs linux (which distro?) usage type: optional but things like type of work you do (web dev, docker, ram usgae, browsing, video streaming, brightness levels, dgpu disabled or enabled, etc...) my 9510 is getting around 200ish fps in valorant and 60-70 fps in forza horizon 5 at high settings. not sure if this is a bug, and i have fiddled with all the settings but i cant seem to get over 100 fps in csgo. i am currently getting an unstable 70-80 fps. knwoing that this is a very old game, i am quite concerned. i\\'m unfamiliar with these scores, is this good or bad? my laptop need around 45 seconds to start up. i read something about problems with audio drivers, i tried reinstall this drivers, install older versions and even i disable drivers updates by windows. but any of this don\\'t make a difference. any idea how to fix it? i wanted to share an easy fix for a touchpad issue with the 9520. out of the box the touchpad was rubbish, with a tiny popping sound and slight vibration following most physical clicks, and even with light taps. there was also a sticky feeling with an initial click that went away with subsequent clicks, but then returned after a few minutes of touchpad inactivity. it felt so cheap. i made two fixes: unscrewed six black screws holding touchpad. pried up metal bracket with plastic spudger (no need to remove motherboard). turns out the bracket was slightly glued down! possibly with blue loctite that seeped out from those screws? i rubbed some paper underneath the bracket to remove any residue and then reattached the screws. the problem was improved, but not gone, so i added narrow strips of white printer paper under the edges of the bracket for some extra pressure (see photo). possibly there was some flex in the microrivets holding the layers of the bracket together? the black plastic wrap on the battery wasn\\'t stuck down very well and might have been slightly flexed by trackpad clicks. i pressed it down against the battery cells and then sat it under a book overnight. touchpad is now completely fixed with no unexpected sounds, vibrations, or stickiness! https://preview.redd.it/9swuy8t5a3d91.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40578ffe5ec753b1dc96fe53a4d82418fad1d627 i put in a 980 pro 1tb to my xps, and am getting lower than expected random r/w iops: https://i.imgur.com/1foknq2.png 126k iops read / 90k iops write i didn\\'t test the micron ssd that was in here before, but i have a 500tb 980 pro in a desktop running a 5900x, and that one gets about double the iops despite being about 10 tb written vs the new drive in my 9520. my 9520 is in the default raid mode however, i wonder if that\\'s the issue? what are other people seeing? note the crystal disk mark test i am running is profile-->peak performance and i switched it to nvme mode so it uses 16 threads (settings-->nvme) i needed to install a second ssd in my 9520, but of course it doesn\\'t come with a heatsink or even a screw for the second slot. a google search turned up rather expensive solutions on amazon (>£20), shipped direct from china. i tried dell uk support chat and got nowhere. i finally tried premium phone support and was put through to a very helpful rep. they said since my machine was less than 28 days old (and presumably because i have premium support), they would ship me the heatsink free of charge! i tried to confirm they would send the right heatsink, knowing ssd2\\'s is different than ssd1\\'s, but the rep wouldn\\'t confirm any part numbers for me. that wasn\\'t promising, but i had to hope they\\'d send me the right one. i eventually received a support email, but it said the part was backordered. at this point i figured it would be weeks before it came, if ever. but the next day i got a shipping update, and the part was delivered the day after that! but here\\'s the twist - inexplicably they sent me the heatsink for ssd2 (part 3jjdg), plus the heatsink for ssd1 (part 06n16), plus a small bracket for a size 2230 ssd (part 0gyf4), plus the entire cpu/video heatsink assembly (part v9pvy), and finally a chempad wipe (part 2v9wx). all parts were marked \"scrap part - no returned required.\" i\\'m shocked and have no idea why they sent all this. the cpu/video heatsink assembly seems to be used, but the other parts appear new. unfortunately, the one thing they didn\\'t send was an m2x2 screw to attach the ssd heatsink, but thankfully i have a spare. got a second hand xps 9520. it took me all evening to do a system recovery as the windows image the seller left installed did not recognize wifi not touchscreen, so i could not even finish the installation of windows 11. now, i dont seem to find installed \"my dell\" and when i find it in microsoft app store, it does not show me a \"install\" button.. see here: https://imgur.com/a/r9cegrx am i missing something dumb again? is this the only way to get to dell power modes? i would be using this for a master\\'s course in data science. i had nearly finalized my decision but all the issues people have been complaining about on reddit and youtube comments is making me hesitate. from what i\\'ve learnt the macbook pro has better battery life, better display no heating issues but the only problem is...it isn\\'t windows. i\\'ve never used macos and as of now that remains my only concern. the other option i\\'ve been considering is the thinkpad carbon x1 gen 9. \\u200b would be helpful to hear existing owners\\' opinions on the xps 13/15. congrats, you’re gonna love it. are these apps serving a real purpose or are they bloatware? i received my xps 13 plus this week and i absolutely love it! i\\'m just exploring out the external gpu options (egpu). is this a safe option for this laptop? i\\'ve got i7-1280p / 32 gb / 2tb / fhd+. if i commit to an external gpu will this have a significant negative impact on the lifetime of my lapto? it’s really cool looking but i jus want to know if there is any design reason behind it not sure how much this matters to everyone, but recently i was experimenting with ways to make my wifi stronger in my home office. someone suggested that the laptop lid may be hindering the actual antenna. so i did a very rudimentary test on speedtest.net 1 - laptop lid open - 12 ping, 134 download latency, 145mb down, 32 mb up, 26 upload latency. 2 - laptop lid closed - 12 ping, 199 download latency, 51 mb down, 32 mb up, 28 upload latency. you guys can try for yourselves, maybe it\\'s just me? i have a dell xps 13 9305. the webcam is detected but only a grey screen is displayed. i tried updating the driver but it says that it\\'s up to date. i have no idea where to go from here. so i recently got a used xps 15 9510 and it had a clean install of windows 11 with non of dells programs. temps average between 60-80 celsius degrees when i’m just browsing the internet or do very light tasks. over time the fans start up and they never shut off unless i turn off the computer until it cools down. the fans run almost what sounds like full blast even thought the temps were at 65 degrees celsius. i installed dell power manager to enable quiet mode and it helped a tiny bit but don’t want to have to limit the performance just to slightly reduce the fan speed. as i had the computer just sitting doing nothing for a while turned on and i could hear the fans on the other side of the room. any tips would be beneficial. i will try looking to repast the cpu and gpu in hopes that helps. i have a dell xps 9720 that i am trying to connect to an lg 38wn95c-w ultrawide monitor via the provided thunderbolt cable. the monitor is not being detected for video display. the monitor

xps 15 with 12 gen i7, 3050ti, and 64 gb ram. accidentally let it die a couple days back. i’ve plugged it in, held down power for 15 and the machine will not turn on. i can get the backlit keyboard to light up but that is it. tried a few solutions that i’ve read with different comin i arizona of plugging the machine, flipping the lid, and holding power button down but nothing seems to work. super peeved as i’ve only had this machine for about 14 days. any suggestions on anything else i can try? i’m fairly windows savvy. today i had my xps 13pkus touch pad replaced since my old one was broken already after 17 days. but now after the repair i\\'ve noticed the smallest tears only screen...well cracks, there right above the hinge mechanism and i wondered if it was cause of the repair or just a issue with the design, should i call dell again? i’m about to get the dell xps 17 9720, and i want to know if there is any midi latency. i use a keyboard a lot to make music. just got a new dell xps 15 9520 for work (a job i haven\\'t started yet, i\\'m just playing around with the new computer and getting things set up which my new boss told me i could charge for) and everything was fine until last night when the wifi speeds suddenly dropped to 0.5 mbps (yes, practically unusable) with no warning or changes. my 8 year old macbook pro, gaming desktop, phone, etc., all have no issues and reach 400+ mbps on our orbi rbk753 mesh connected to gigabit service. this machine has the intel ax211 card. i thought maybe it doubled up on an ipv4 address already on my network so i assigned it to static with cloudflare dns and tried a few different ip addresses with no luck. turning off the machine and turning it back on resulted in 60mbps down/up which is still not great, then after updating the driver and attempting a registry hack to provide full power to the wireless card on battery (https://www.dell.com/community/xps/xps-15-killer-wireless-slow/td-p/7678781/page/2), it\\'s back down to about 0.5mbps. anyone have any experience with this? edit: umm suddenly i\\'m getting 300mbps down/180mbps up... will update if it goes off again 😅 edit2: now i\\'m getting 600mbps down... https://preview.redd.it/qckb8sjxfzc91.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=993c8054d3337ee4331a3f7f58d399773c96d2c2 hi all, i am having issues with screen tearing while playing games on my xps 9510. this only occurs when my computer is unplugged and is capped to 60 fps. whenever i get more than 60 frames tearing does not occur. what doesn\\'t make sense to me, is that the tearing doesn\\'t happen when i plug in my laptop and get 200 fps with a 60 hz screen. i feel like the situation is reversed and it is pretty confusing. also, turning on vsync makes the tearing even worse. any help would be appreciated. hello to everyone. i want to share how i managed to enable/disable intel turbo boost (for those facing issues with this). first some introduction with my case. i have 2pcs dell xps 13 9310. first one doesn’t have any issues with disabling/enabling all functions possible inside bios (current bios version 3.7.0). when i bought the second unit first thing i did was to upgrade all drivers and bios as well. my current bios version is 3.7.0 and system is running on windows 11 pro. as the issue (which officially as per dell is not an issue but i am really in doubt about this) of the flashing charging light when the laptop is connected to charger and turbo boost kick in is really annoying i wanted to disable turbo boost from bios. and then i realized that it is not possible and when i toggle it \"off\" it returns to \"on\" position again. in fact, after spending some time inside bios, i have noticed that as well is not possible to change the options of \"intel speedstep\", \"c-state control\", \"intel hyper-threading technology\" and \"intel virtualization technology\" (maybe i am missing some other option as well). as my other unit does not have these problems i have started searching in internet if there is any solution. as i saw - there was none. after some bios update onward these options could not be changed. this get us to the solution which accidentally i have found that worked for me and i hope can be helpful for someone else as well. i have downloaded different old bios versions (3.6.0, 3.4.0 and 3.2.0) from dell site and tried downgrade the bios by executing the downloaded \"exe\" file from windows. i have noticed that during the downgrading of the bios everything went normal except when \"sending intel(r) management engine firmware update\" process was completed after it appeared message \"me firmware downgrade was not allowed\" and then \"me update failed\". maybe this is the reason why after the downgrade process is completed and windows is started in the notification panel appears message that restart is required in order to finish with the update of bios 3.7.0. once the system is restarted automatically bios update is performed and bios is reverted back to my current version 3.7.0. and finally we are getting to the moment how i have managed to disable/enable turbo boost. the only bios version that has worked for me was 3.2.0. so, i have started downloaded xps_13_9310_3.2.0.exe from dell site and restarted the system. downgrade process started and again \"me update failed\" appeared. once the downgrade was completed and system automatically restarted before windows is booted by pressing f2 i went into the bios. and now the options which was not able to be changed (including turbo boost) now already was possible to toggle on/off. i have disabled turbo boost, system restarted, windows loaded and message that restart is required in order to finish with the update of bios 3.7.0 appeared again. i have restarted the system, automatically bios update was performed and bios is reverted back to my current version 3.7.0. after this when i entered the bios the situation was again same as in the beginning - some options could not be changed. only that turbo boost have remained in off position. i have repeated the procedure (downgrading to 3.2.0 - after downgrade completed and system restarted before windows boot enter into the bios - change turbo boost setting - boot into windows - restart - automatic bios update performed) and it again worked - changed setting was saved. i hope above written could help to anyone and will be really great if someone experiencing the problem that cannot enable/disable intel turbo boost try it and give his feedback. i\\'m looking at picking this model up for school, and i\\'m aware these are hardly gaming laptops, but i\\'d like to be able to casually play ffxiv in between assignments. it\\'s fine if it can only run at medium/low settings, as long as it can maintain 60fps, but i don\\'t wanna commit this much money to a laptop if it can\\'t even do that much. can anyone who plays xiv and has one let me know if it\\'ll do or should i keep looking elsewhere? i guess it is no secret to this community that waves maxxaudio pro sucks. it has been nothing but a pain to remove it. it creates a distorted effect on audio that sounds \"echoey\", like a chorus filter. it is most notable on voice audio. you can experience the change by comparing the sound from 3.5mm earbuds to the sound from a usb-c earbud with built-in dac. disable enhancements? it will be re-enabled every time the computer restarts. uninstall waves maxxaudio pro? the audio services still run in the background. (check it on task manager -> services; two services begins with \"wav\") reinstall waves maxxaudio pro application so that i can disable enhancements? ha, good luck!. i have not found a single reliable way to reinstall it, despite all the resources on the internet, and even dell\\'s \"drivers and downloads\" webpage. stop the waves services manually? they start every time computer restarts and there is no effect to sound quality if they are stopped manually. delete the waves services executable? you can\\'t. you need permissions from \"system\" to do that, even if you are administrator. \\u200b okay, the frustration has overwhelmed me at this point, so i did a bunch of things simultaneously. whatever i can to make the bad sound stop. this includes installing (or attempting to install) older realtek drivers, the older waves maxxaudio application, and a bios update dell\\'s \"drivers and downloads\" webpage. as far as i know, as the many things that i did, only the bios update completed successfully. i restarted my computer and the bios was flashed as part of the update. logging on after the restart, i got a prompt that some wav... (don\\'t remember full name) executable can not be found, and that the shortcut to it will be deleted. finally, the beast is dead! \\u200b was this as hard for you as it was for me? was it really the bios update, or the (older) drivers reinstall that solved it? what is the correct solution for future dell xps 8950 owners that have to deal with this problem? so for some reason windows 11 recognizes the touchpad as a mouse so i cant change any of the button and touch settings. hoping i can find the official drivers if anyone knows the brand/model. thanks!! granted, i know nothing about laptops and it’s functions, and i’m sure i’m going to mess some terms up. however, from a smooth-brained college student’s point of view, it’s great! it does run hot sometimes but i’ve had no issues with the keyboard, display, or touchpad. in fact, i love the keyboard. it’s smooth and satisfying to type on. battery life.. is better than my last laptop? i had a thinkpad x390 and that laptop died after about half a day of work. i never measured how long the dell xps 13 plus lasts, but it gets through a day of normal college work - word, google, evernote. it also stays alive the next day even if i forget to charge. the screen is very very high quality. sometimes it hurts my eyes because of how hd it is lol. i still haven’t figured out how to turn it down if it’s even possible (a waste, i know, but my vision’s bad enough as it is). very nice when i was binge watching some shows though. i got the oled display. the ports don’t bother me much yet. i’m sure i’ll run into some issues later on though. it only has two usb-c ports, and honestly…. why? the adapter only has one port for usb-a and that’s a bit inconvenient. side note, i thought it was cool how both ports could charge the laptop. anyway, that’s my informal and ignorant review of the laptop. the rundown is that the laptop is very sexy to the eyes and a bit inconvenient function wise. as a person who loves aesthetics though, this is great. hello! i just ordered a dell xps 15 9520 from best buy and realized i may have made a mistake. mine is the fhd version and my main gripe is the matte screen. so here’s the question: are the 4k/uhd/3.5k versions all touch screens with glossy oled’s? there’s lots of configs on dell’s site so it’s difficult for me to find my goldilocks of laptops. another fly in the ointment: i bought from best buy. it sounds like special ordering something i’ve seen on the dell site is out of the question. hi! i can\\'t find any reliable information on adobergb coverage of the 15.6\", fhd+ 1920x1200, 60hz, non-touch, anti-glare, 500 nit, infinityedge display of the current xps 15. it only tells me \"100 % srgb und 90 % dci-p3\" on https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/help-me-choose/cp/hmc-lcd-display-consumer-xps but i am not sure if this table was updated recently. i know the uhd+ covers 100% adobergb but i don\\'t need uhd resolution, but i need a good adobe rgb coverage, since i do a lot of printing as a photographer. i tried to talk to the dell support two times, but they were not able to answer my question. for example: question: can you tell me the adobe rgb coverage of the 15.6\", fhd+ display of the current xps 15 models? answer: do you want to know the brightness of the display ? thanks! anyone tested ubuntu 22.04 on the xps 13 plus? is the webcam working? my local bestbuy is selling a store display item as open box at nearly 50% of the retail price. i\\'ve noticed that the laptop screen is always on in demo mode, playing dell xps ads all the time. for all i know, they\\'ve had it on display for the last one year or so. should i be concerned about oled screen life span or screen burn? any other issues to think about? (there were some minor scratches/marks on the laptop body, none on the screen). hi all, the battery indicator on the front of my xps 13 suddenly started blinking today, 1 amber and three white. i was using the laptop and suddenly the screen went black. i tried hitting a few random buttons and it did not seem to respond. then i tried plugging in an external display and a mouse and then the laptop\\'s screen came back on and it\\'s been working normally since (as far as i can tell). in fact i am typing this post on the laptop in question. then i noticed the blinking lights. what\\'s strange is while doing my research i could not find anything corresponding to my particular pattern of blinking lights. in fact i could find nothing about a single amber blink. does anyone know what is going on? thanks, -stumpyblue hi folks, just in case this happens to anyone else, i had windows update offer me a bunch of optional audio drivers this week for my xps 13 plus 9320. these drivers killed all speaker based audio. i\\'m not sure exactly what individual thing fixed it, but i went into device manager, uninstalled all of the audio or speaker related devices and and then installed the realtek drivers from dell, followed by a reboot. this brought everything back. hello everyone, i’m looking to buy the xps 17 9720. a big concern i have when buying laptops is the storage. i have a large library of content i use to make music, so 4tb is what i’m aiming for here. however, the maximum storage available from dell is 2tb. i know that you can upgrade the ssd, but i want to make sure everything is compatible. i plan on buying the 512 gb option (the cheapest), then discarding that and buying the ssd options separately. i’m thinking about getting two samsung 980 pro 2tb ssd cards (pcie 4.0 nvme). i need to be absolutely sure they will be compatible. will i run into any issues? i had my eyes set on purchasing the 9720 with the following specs: i7 12700h nvidia gtx 3050 32 gb ram fhd+ (i don\\'t want the 4k display) however, i\\'m seeing a bunch of posts of some people hating the laptop or loving it. it seems that battery life is crap as well as qc for some people, and for others it\\'s perfect: they get great battery life and no qc issues. i was also under the impression that the xps lineup is prioritizing productivity, but like i mentioned, i\\'m seeing a bunch of posts complaining about issues with the laptop. i plan to install a linux distro on it, have the gpu disabled most of the time, and i\\'m certain i\\'ll be able to squeeze out a few hours of battery by doing that. i\\'ll be using the laptop exclusively for programming and devops related tasks. i\\'m looking to replace my 2016 mbp i just want an all around great laptop that will last a few years and is upgradeable. thoughts? opinions? are the complaints real or is this a great device? hi all, i\\'m not an active community member, but since i found some useful posts here i figured i\\'d share my experience today. i\\'ve recently bought a dell xps 15 9520 with a 12700h, 32gb ram, 3050ti, 1tb, 15\" oled. i\\'m mainly a professional user, but i like to play my cities: skylines on the side. i\\'ve noticed that when the fans are blazing, the air isn\\'t particularly hot and i\\'ve noticed that the cpu throttles / hits 100c quite easily. i\\'ve removed the back cover as seen in a youtube video on how to disassemble the 9510, disconnected the battery (probably wasn\\'t needed), removed the fans and then the heatsink, the screws are marked 1 - 4 and won\\'t fall out once you undo them. the heatsink needs a slight wiggle before coming off. i\\'ve found an absolute ton of thermal paste under there of cheap, not very liquid, quality. on the cpu it was even overflowing the cpu chip (not just the die). i\\'ve thoroughly cleaned all the old thermal paste, first using a small plastic scraper for the bulk of the material. on the cpu chip there\\'s no resistors or capacitors sticking out around the die so that\\'s easy, but as usual, the gpu has(!) so be careful not to break any of those. after that i used toilet paper, cotton swabs and arctic silver arcticlean 1, then when all was clean, the arcticlean 2 with cotton swabs until both dies were sterile. on the cpu i\\'ve put the liquid metal of thermal grizzly conductonaut, and on the gpu, thermal grizzly kryonaut extreme. this because of the resistors and caps around the gpu die that i don\\'t want to risk short circuiting. also, the cpu has way more trouble managing it\\'s heat dissipation than the gpu. when putting it back together i\\'ve very slowly increased the tension of the heatsink to the die\\'s by only rotating each screw a few turns before going to the next one, until i\\'ve gone around like 4 or 5 times. ofcourse the laptop was stuck booting the first time, which made me break some sweat but after a restart all was good. the cpu now idles at around 40c, under medium load around 60c. windows set to \"high performance\" and dell power manager set to \"ultra performance\", plugged in. cinebench r23 multi-core score was 12064 points on the first run. initially the cpu throttled because the fans were still idle, but once the fans actually started rotating (not blazing anymore), the average cpu temperature during the 10 minute run was 77 - 82c. the gpu, under full load in cities: skylines, did not go over 80c. (used an fps improvement mod to fully load the gpu in the game) the best thing is that the whole laptop is so much quieter now! hope this helps someone! :) very good review. basically 90% of my experience on the common parts of the configs we both have. haptic touchpad: agreed, at times i catch myself thinking there is a real button there. thermals: yeah, it runs hot. even on my i5 keyboard: agreed again, good keyboard screen: even my fhd panel is good. i run it at 125% as at this size any lower is way too small for my 40 year old eyes. cpu: even my i5 runs hot. i have not done benchmarks. i am using mine for photoshop and other photo editing apps out in the field. i don\\'t play any games so i can\\'t comment on it. for my purposes the performance is ok but i am kind of disappointed in how hot the bottom gets. battery: i do wish my i5+fhd lasted more than 6 hours. if i do absolutely nothing it may last longer but if that\\'s the case, i would\\'ve bought an ipad and keyboard. if i use my photo editing software, i can kill the thing in 3-4 hours without even going into rendering on it. overall: if you keep your expectations in line of what it is, it can work for you. i needed portability for travel so i think it works for my use case. and oh, i like the aesthetics. so i\\'ve been searching for a laptop for a little while now. i would just get a macbook, however, i\\'m a finance major so i\\'ve been looking for a windows machine. would you guys say the xps 13 plus would do the job? my only concern is the taskbar seems a bit weird especially for excel work since i may be using the function keys somewhat often. if you all have other suggestions please let me know; i\\'d like it to be something portable and rather clean/minimal looking similar to the xps line. any advice/recommendations are appreciated. so i got my xps 13 plus (9320) yesterday and just wondering if i\\'m being picky, or have i picked up a dud? first issue is the space bar. it needs more pressure to press than all the other keys meaning spaces are often missing from my text. it\\'s really infuriating to have to go back constantly and add spaces in where all the other keys are fine. are others space bars slightly different to the other keys? also, i know these run hot, but i\\'ve got 16gb ram and it struggles to play any video content at all. in chrome with 3-4 tabs open, a youtube video will skip and lag, locking everything up, juddered scrolling, and basically unable to multi-task at all while any video content is playing. it\\'s only a day old, and i haven\\'t installed any dodgy software but i never had any graphics issues withmy 8th gen xps 13. just wondering if anyone else has any similar experiences? i\\'m looking to upgrade my current xps 15 from 2017 to the latest 9520 and not really sure about the i7 12700h vs i9 12900hk option. i almost exclusively find reviews on the i7 12700h but almost nothing on the i9. i\\'m especially interested in power consumption and battery life besides the performance. i\\'m mostly doing video editing with adobe premiere, graphic design with photoshop and a lot of (rather complex) editing with lightroom classic. i\\'m traveling a lot in my van and need the machine to have a good energy efficiency and i somehow doubt the i9 would be the best option but i\\'m not sure... besides the cpu i am going for win 11 pro, geforce rtx 3050 ti, 32 gb ram and 2 tb ssd + the uhd+ ips panel. hey, \\u200b does the xps 13 plus thermal throttle often with an i7 ? cant find any reviews mention this. \\u200b ty hey, i have an xps 13 plus and i would want to know if its okay if i play games like cs go and valorant on it? i recently bought an xps 15 and i noticed that it\\'s using about 8 gb ram on idle with just sticky notes open. i was wondering if this is normal since that\\'s 50% of my memory being used up in idle. i\\'ve had this laptop a few days. here are some thoughts. basic specs: intel i7-1280p, 32gb ram, ips screen i spend my time in r (statistics program, and why i needed 32gb or ram), word, and excel. i usually have music playing too. first, it\\'s really fast and powerful, but with a caveat. i have to turn ultra performance mode in dell settings, and set it to best performance in the windows battery settings. if i don\\'t, it stutters and freezes up from throttling down to 0.4ghz. sometimes it still throttles to that speed with those settings, but for a much shorter time (1 minute as opposed to 10minutes) since i turned on those settings. this is weird, but since i use it plugged in 95% of the time, battery life isn\\'t affected. i imagine this will be super annoying to others. it is not good, but it must be solvable unless i got a lemon. so far, it doesn\\'t feel hot, or at least not any hotter than my 5 year old asus zenbook s. the keyboard is really, really, nice. i am coming from an asus zenbook s and it\\'s as if i\\'ve never used a good keyboard before. the speakers are a huge upgrade for me, but compared to a friend\\'s mac-book and another friend\\'s alienware, they are quite average. the touch-bar takes some getting used to. having the delete key not be a physical button is weird. i\\'m slowly learning to \"trust\" it when i touch it. i really hope dell offers a way to turn off the permanently lit lights. windows hello login is so instant with my face. i really like that. the webcam is decent enough. i have no opinions on battery life, since i only use it plugged in. i just purchased a new xps 15 and i have been having issues with the audio. randomly throughout the day the audio seems to stop working and fixes itself only after a restart. i have noticed this is more likely to occur when changing from one application to another. for example, just recently i started zoom and tested the audio which was fine. then went onto chrome to watch youtube and the audio bugged out for the whole computer. i also tried connecting external headphones which did not work. all the drivers are up to date. windows is up to date. i have had this computer for approximately 3 days now i just barely received my dell xps 15 i9 laptop from dell.com. it is silver on the outside and black on the inside. bestbuy.com now has the i7 version in white available for the same price i paid for the i9 one (dell.com gave me a student discount) the white looks awesome! what\\'s the return policy for dell.com? does anyone have experience with their returns? i\\'m curious to see how the white looks on the outside since i have never seen white with a metal chassis? or is it only white on the inside and it\\'s the same color on the outside? because if it is the ladder then i most likely won\\'t be changing it. so...another issue arose. my laptop has no sound. i can hear the beeping sound when i try to increase or decrease the sound in the sound bar, but when i play videos or music, there is no sound. i\\'ve done troubleshooting, reinstalled drivers to no avail. does anyone know a fix for this? it\\'s brand new, seriously, i\\'m getting annoyed with all the issues i\\'ve been having so far. i should\\'ve bought an asus instead. i recently bought an xps 15 and i noticed that it\\'s using about 8 gb ram on idle with just sticky notes open. i was wondering if this is normal since that\\'s 50% of my memory being used up in idle. hi all, \\u200b i have a dell xps 8950 with 32gb of ram, needing to upgrade to 64gb. \\u200b to buy the oem memory direct from dell is an outstanding £196.79 per 16gb stick https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/dell-memory-upgrade-16gb-1rx8-ddr5-udimm-4800mhz/apd/ab883074/memory#techspecs_section \\u200b however, i have found similar specced ram from crucial here at a far more reasonable £89.99: \\u200b https://uk.crucial.com/memory/ddr5/ct16g48c40u5 \\u200b and even a cheap knock off copy of the oem ram by integral: \\u200b https://www.ballicom.co.uk/integral-snpk7g24c-16g-in-.p1546267.html \\u200b will either of these two work with my oem ram? ideally i would just like to buy 2 more 16gb ram sticks from either the above crucial or ballicom link and add to me x2 16gb oem ram sticks. \\u200b thanks, \"here is why, i will tell you why because i get paid to produce videos with click bait title this is not about dell, this is about me, getting paid when you click\" which model is that? i have been playing with linux on my desktop and want to try to use it on this laptop now (duel boot) but i cant figure out how to boot of the usb i have plugged in. anybody has some ideas why? diagnostic blinking code : 2x blinking + 4x white means regarding dell website: ram fault. makes sense, pc doesn\\'t boot. when i put the factory sided ram back, ifs fine. what about the right amount of pins? you will find 260+262 pins, but this can be cop paste crap from the past. hello! i am going to get my xps 13 plus! i am wondering which hub i should buy for it because of only two tb😬. request : 1. pd and hdmi 2. ethernet port 3. good look🥺(for black xps 13 plus) 4. less weight 5. less than usd 100 thanks! from taiwan user i have the chance to get a used dell xps 15 9510 11 gen i7 16 ram 512 gb fhd for $850. has 3050ti to gpu as well. i mostly need it for programming and transferring files from the laptop to ssd and back. i was also thinking of upgrading the ssd with a samsung 970 evo plus to get the fastest transfer speeds i could and upgrade ram to 32gb. i\\'m just looking for opinions if i should jump on this or not. new to windows not sure if this is a good buy or not. hi all. i’m planing to move from precision 5530 4k resolution to xps 9710(i7 with rtx3050) 4k+ resolution. does 9710 will work with tb16? now i’m using precision 5530 in two configuration: - tb16+180w power supply , external monitor 3440x1440 and precision internal monitor. -tb16+240w power supply, two monitors 2560x1440 and precision internal monitor in both configuration precision is connected with tb3 cable and i’m getting 130w pd charging (checked in bios) does xps 9710 will work in the same way? i want to avoid extra costs with buying two new docking stations. i currently have the xps 9700 with two ssds (both are pcie gen3), the original ssd and a samsung 970 evo plus 2tb. the evo is just a storage drive, and the os is installed on the other drive. i just ordered the xps 17 9720, with a 1tb ssd. i understand that the new ssd is pcie gen 4. ideally, i would like to add the samsung 970 evo plus as a 2nd ssd in the open slot. however, i\\'m not sure if installing a pcie gen 3 will slow down the other sdd, which is pcie gen 4. i would assume that it would only slow both drives to pcie gen 3 speeds if both drives are set it up in raid. but, if i switch to ahci, will i be able to run both pcie gen 4 and gen 3 speeds? i\\'ve looked over hundreds of different laptop models from various companies and dell xps 13 plus is the one that seems to have got everything i need: it\\'s literally the dream laptop for me. it\\'s the sexiest (look at the compact and sleek keyboard panel! pic) and thinnest (0.6 inch thick) and lightest (2.77 lbs) laptop with all the specs i need (12th gen i7 processor, lots of cores, 16gb ram with 5.2ghz dual channel, oled screen, nvme ssd). however i read from a lot of people on the internet that dell products are more prone to defects and require more frequent repairing compared to laptops by other companies, like power suddenly going off even though battery\\'s not dead, parts falling apart, having to press the power button twice to turn it on, or other flaws in robustness or functionality. does this apply to more expensive laptops like dell xps 13 plus too? if you have this laptop, could you tell me its downsides that potential buyers like me needs to know about before the purchase? these 2 laptops are currently practically the same in price buying them used (around 1-1.3k for top spec models). i didn\\'t want to go for the newer models since i wanted to save a little cash and i also didn\\'t want to roll the dice by buying them new with frequent qc issues and all. the way i see it buying them used gives me some faith that since it was tested there won\\'t be many if at all qc issues. so i\\'ve been debating between the 2 and would like more opinions. the specs for the 15 is the i7-11800h and rtx 3050 ti. the specs for the 17 is the i7-10875h and rtx 2060. the storage and ram are the same. which do you think is the better choice? i just unboxed and am using for the first time the dell xps 13 plus. it is getting extremely hot and i am not running any tasks besides chrome. is there a setting to change the performance mode and is this normal? i purchased my new xps on july 5. so far the order status is \"your order is scheduled for production\". does anyone have any experience what the current production time is for the 9315? i am eagerly waiting for the laptop to arrive. i currently have the xps 9700 with two ssds (both are pcie gen3), the original ssd and a samsung 970 evo plus 2tb. the evo is just a storage drive, and the os is installed on the other drive. i just ordered the xps 17 9720, with a 1tb ssd. i understand that the new ssd is pcie gen 4. ideally, i would like to add the samsung 970 evo plus as a 2nd ssd in the open slot. however, i\\'m not sure if installing a pcie gen 3 will slow down the other sdd, which is pcie gen 4. i would assume that it would only slow both drives to pcie gen 3 speeds if both drives are set it up in raid. but, if i switch to ahci, will i be able to run both pcie gen 4 and gen 3 speeds? so i just got my new dell xps 13 plus today with ubuntu 20.04 lts. i am wondering if it is worth it to eventually upgrade to pop!_os or ubuntu 22.04 lts. would i lose support for things like the fingerprint reader or the webcam since i know there might not be drivers for those devices? recently had it with my 9710 losing wifi, needing hard reboots instead of waking from sleep, etc. went to \"reset\" windows (because all the hardware diagnostics failed) and that stuck me in an endless stupid loop where the thing couldn\\'t find the boot disc. got on with support, rebuilt the machine, and everything was great. until, that is, i reinstalled system bios - 1.11.0 - and now the thing is a$$ again. just to ease my mind - is it me and this machine? is anyone else having issues with 1.11.0? any suggestions? hello everyone! i\\'m in the search for a laptop for school and i\\'m torn between the two laptops. i\\'ll be going to college in 2 months and i\\'m planning on majoring in cs. so my use case will be mostly school work, a bit of youtube and somewhat heavy gaming (i might have to give this up if i take the mac) my main question is how\\'s the xps 15 9520 in terms of: battery life heating display (i\\'m planning to choose the 3.5k oled panel) gaming (i\\'ll be gaming call of duty) audio upgradability (can i swap out the ssd and ram) whether or not i can use an external gpu any issues that you think i should know of my school has given me a $1700 grant for a laptop. so i wanna buy a laptop to last me for at least 4 years. i\\'m currently using an ancient hp probook 4540s from 2012 with an intel i3 3rd generation processor, so i\\'m looking forward to the huge leap in performance. this is a big investment for me. thank you in advance for your opinion. cheers! hey, i\\'ve been thinking about buying the dell xps. i have read and heard a lot about the battery problems and the oled screen consuming a great deal of power. would this be great for any virtualization work with vmware the majority of my work is done in a virtual environment. and using word and excel. is anybody facing an issue with slow wifi speeds? i tried reinstalling the drivers and removing the killer software but it is not helping. i read a bunch of posts but none seem to help or are outdated. would love to know if someone has fixed this issue recently. thanks!! hi guys ! i am new here, i am getting xps 15 9510 3050ti i7 16gigs fhd 512gb for 1100 usd and oled 3.5k 1tb for 1.4k usd please tell me whether oled is that much better? i want a better battery life rather than having a better screen (considering i have been using laptop with 768p screen xd) when deciding which laptop to get this year for work, i had a lot of requirements. due to the lack of data on the internet, there were some requirements that i took a gamble on when i ordered the new xps 13 plus. i am writing this post to cover my findings on those requirements now that i have had possession of the new xps 13 plus for several days. specs: i7 14 core 32 gb ram 1tb ssd fhd monitor dark grey os: windows - picked only because the configurator wouldn\\'t allow me to pick the processor and ram combo with ubuntu \\u200b power cables: the included adapter works well but it is very dell specific. i found that my anker usb c chargers that are over 60w are working just as well as the factory charger. this is the same setup i had with my 2016 xps model. i also have a 100w anker usb c charger that powers my dock which charges the new xps as well. docks: i had a requirement of having 3 monitors (1080p) and so i wanted to try a new dock this year. i went with https://www.amazon.com/dp/b086dxlf37 and it has performed well. only issue with this dock is cable management. external monitors: i was unsure of how many monitors this new model would support. initially i was looking into dell models with dedicated graphics cards to support this requirement. i was very pleased to find out that with just one cable, i am able to get power into the xps from the dock while also pushing graphics to all three of my 1080p monitors. additionally, the laptop screen can also continue to be used which gives me a current total of 4 monitors to use. this was plug and play with no additional work needed. i am using the usbc port on the right hand side of the xps as i believe this one is more powerful. battery life with fhd screen: initially, i chose the oled screen but after seeing that most of the reviewers online received this model and had issues i went with the fhd screen. i wanted oled as it is simply beautiful however, i needed more than 4 hours of battery life. i am happy to report that after windows did its setup thing the first few days, i am easily getting over 8 hours of battery life with this setup. this is similar to my 2016 xps model. headphones and microphones: previously i had always preferred the apple wired headphones as they are cheap and have great quality. i am pleased to announce that these headphones work perfectly using the included usbc to headphone jack dongle from the xps box. fingerprint magnet: i knew this dark model would show some finger prints. i thought it would just show if my fingers were greasy, etc. i was way off. the dark model shows everything. literally everything you touch regardless of cleanliness, will show on this model. i feel disgusting and am constantly cleaning the device. \\u200b strength of body: i accidentally had my macbook pro 13 lightly touch the new xps 13 plus and although the macbook was completely unscratched, the xps now has a permanent scuff. \\u200b performance: this laptop is extremely powerful. i knew this would be a work horse, however i didnt quite anticipate just how powerful this setup would be. it has handled everything i have thrown at it while remaining faster than my t420 and r720 servers. i am impressed. \\u200b heat: performance always comes at the cost of heat management. with a laptop so small i knew it would get hot but i didnt know if it was still \\'lap-able\\'. i am pleased to report that even under tremendous load, i am still comfortable using the device in jeans. i will say that the home key row does get a bit toasty though under these conditions. \\u200b drivers: my model came with everything running well. the only drivers i needed to load were for a usb-a to ethernet dongle i had around the office. it was an apple dongle and so i just downloaded the bootcamp package and retrieved the drivers i needed. \\u200b context menus: this is more an issue with windows 11 than anything specific to the xps, but i struggled to get 7-zip to show in the right click menus. i eventually switched to nanazip and followed their directions. https://github.com/m2team/nanazip \\u200b hello and finger print on domain users: another windows 11 issue. i was unable to get hello and finger print to work with my user tied to my work domain. i couldn\\'t figure it out for days and then stumbled on an article that explained that this is not supposed to work on domains but you can make it work through a registry edit. basically you have to enable pin login for domain users and then hello and finger print just work after that: https://www.technipages.com/windows-11-fingerprint-option-is-currently-unavailable \\u200b wsl2 update errors: coming from the xps developer edition to a windows device i knew that wsl2 was going to be huge for me. on initial setup, everything was good but then i couldn\\'t run \"sudo apt install ...\" without failures to connect. after much troubleshooting i found that my company\\'s antivirus was blocking the connection so once we got that sorted and made sure the windows firewall was setup correctly, we were back in business. \\u200b overall: i am overall extremely impressed with this laptop. a few learning points but i highly recommend it non-the-less. i am writing this in hopes that it helps others with similar requirements. ubuntu 22.04 on the dell xps 15 9520 works pretty fucking well. there, i said it. i got this boi from work. i have been fond of the dell xps line for a while. i have a personal xps 15 9560, had a 9570 at work (which was stolen) and currently a 7590. i have installed ubuntu on all of them and found the combo pretty decent, with some ups and downs. ubuntu 22.04 took a little tinkering to smoothen out but i\\'m impressed with well it works. what worked out of the box: wifi (2.4/5ghz at least), bluetooth fingerprint reader, configured through the settings gui nvidia drivers with on-demand, version 515 by default the intel gpu is used, by using __nv_prime_render_offload=1 __glx_vendor_library_name=nvidia command you can run something with the nvidia gpu (not sure where prime-run went) what took some tinkering: audio it sounds horrible after install, as if only the tweeters were working. the bug is fixed in the latest kernels, but 5.15.0.41.44 which i had installed did not have the fix yet. i started a journey to install a more recent kernel but i couldn\\'t manage to install anything that played well with the nvidia drivers. i ended up downloading the ubuntu kernel source (5.15.0-43.46) from here, applying the sound patch from that bug ticket and compiling my kernel. using the custom kernel the sound is good! although it doesn\\'t seem to get below 150hz, not sure if on windows it\\'s better (i deleted it right away, whoops). some wayland apps were not working due to this issue, but there\\'s a workaround. i set __egl_vendor_library_filenames=/usr/share/glvnd/egl_vendor.d/50_mesa.json in my /etc/environment and they run fine now. cool stuff: password unlock with face identification using howdy you can set up the ir camera to login (and much more) without your password the battery consumption is reasonable, installing tlp. obviously the 1080 screen helps. following screen is powertop with the lowest brightness, bluetooth off and wifi on and only chrome with the tab i\\'m writing in open. power consumption with powertop specs the laptop is slick af, and it\\'s super snappy with ubuntu. please feel free to ask any question, happy to answer! i\\'ve had to different people from dell tell me that you can and can\\'t force \\'downgrade\\' to windows 10. before ordering it from them they said its gonna come with windows 11 pro (no option to order with win 10) and that i can install 10 pro myself. got it, burned a windows 10 media creation tool, and during the setup, it does display a drive to install it on. went through 3 ppl on dell support. they said if i purchase a digital license download from the microsoft website i should be able to. did that, and still the same thing. does not recognize any drive during the windows 10 setup. anyone run into this and/or know any suggestions to force it??? honestly i\\'m completely shocked at how much better the i7 is than the i5 at the time of filming it was a 150 difference about 11 more in price i definitely think it\\'s worth it to get the i7 the performance of the i7 was regularly that much faster than the i5 and at times much more than that for almost no noticeable downside in heat or fan noise by the way for those that don\\'t want to wade through 10 minutes of content designed purely so the video can be monetised. hello guys, i have xps 9710. i uninstalled both of intel and nvidia drivers using ddu and reinstalled them. after that, the speaker driver does not seem to be working. any advice would be appreciated. i’m very tight on budget but i’m going into university for mechanical engineering and many students recommend the xps 15 there’s a sale to get one for $2100 cad before tax xps 15 (9510) i7-11800h 16gb memory 512 gb hard drive is this the best price i’ll find? should i just buy it or wait a month to try and find better? hi, so i\\'ve been trying my new xps out for a few days and honestly i am a bit disappointed. the cpu is sitting around 55-60 degrees c _idle_ (in balanced mode) and i have to choose betwen either that high temperature or having the fans quite loud. even in balanced mode the fans are constantly audible just watching youtube, which i didn\\'t expect. is this normal? is there any way to mitigate it? i opened the lid a bit (currently using it with a dock and external monitor) and that helped slightly. i also tried disabling turboboos in bios, which helped but basically killed the performance. i am thinking of just sending it back and getting the i7-1250u (non plus) xps - because why should i limit a processor i paid for (better to just buy something cheaper and slower). i am really a bit undecisive. battery life isn\\'t critical for me but i do not want fans constantly audible when watching youtube videos. any ideas? hi, i upgraded from xps 9310 to 9320. i previously had no issues with my camera output for other users with my 9310 but my video output with the new 9320 unit looks like someone threw a purple-green filter five seconds into the call. the first five seconds is okay but suddenly changes to this (see screenshot below). \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/kthl7us841c91.jpg?width=1306&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60de2f25749362b54524ae86cc2ae8d2ba9e4656 i tried discord web and my video works perfectly fine (although the video sometimes is delayed relative to the audio) and it\\'s annoying me. any thoughts on how to fix this? i tried: completely uninstalling discord and reinstalling it. clicking the camera button 2x-4x-6x to reset camera. running the app on admin mode. ensuring that the app has full access to the camera reinstalling the driver but none of them fixes the issue. \\u200b if this issue persist, i might just return the laptop as i am still within the 30 day return/exchange period. thank you all! hi xps owners, i\\'m buying a xps 13 9310 with the uhd+ configuration and my biggest value in a laptop is battery life when at 200-250 nits (which is about 40%-50% brightness) for university use. will i be able to be content with my purchase or am i shooting myself in the foot? i\\'m hoping that i will be able to achieve at least 9 hours with web browsing and having a couple of apps open in the background. if the battery life on 4k isn\\'t that horrendous, i will consider buying a portable charger somewhere. else, i\\'m probably going to cancel my order... i recently bought an xps 13 plus and my nothing ear (1) earbuds is having some issues. firstly, it takes 3-4 seconds before they automatically connect or disconnect. lastly, the in-ear detection seems to not work. my other laptop, an asus rog, has no issues whatsoever. it automatically pauses videos or music when the earbuds are not in my ear. does anyone know how to fix this? i\\'ve already updated the audio drivers. using xps13 9310 (11th gen, i7-1165g7, 16 gb ram) and wd19tb, i am able to run dual monitor 4k 60hz using 1x dp 1.4 and 1x type c port with dp 1.4. will it be possible to run a third monitor at 4k 60hz? alternatively, qhd or 1080p at 60hz? do i need to upgrade the wd19tb to the wd22tb4? i\\'ve recently bought an xps 13 plus. when i plug it in, the screen goes black for about 2-3 seconds then turn the screen back on. when i unplug it, it does the same. does anyone know a fix for this? i have only seen posts about bugs and problems, but i just want to complement dell on this beautiful piece of hardware. i’ve been using for more than a month now and touchwood, no problems except for the heat pad it becomes. what do you like about it the most? has anyone heard whether costco will get the new 12th gen intel 13\" dell xps 9320? thanks. hi all, i just purchased an xps 13 9310 (uhd+) for a sweet price to use for school, however i am hearing that people are getting eye strains and headaches, with the display being the likely culprit. with some digging, people have been saying that it is because the xpss use pvm technology and there are some people who are sensitive to it. what are your experiences? i would like to know so that i can cancel my order since for university, i will be 24/7 staring at my laptop screen. cheers! to all of you that have a 9520 and use a thunderbolt dock or other peripheral - i don\\'t see thunderbolt anywhere in device manager, and unlike a prior computer and my wife\\'s lenovo (11th gen intel) there isn\\'t a separate intel application on the 9520 for giving docks permission. i don\\'t see any drivers on the dell website for the thunderbolt either. wonder if that is normal or i\\'m missing something on my laptop. my wb22tb (upgraded from wd19tbs) appears to work correctly, but i know tb docks can sometimes work in usb3 mode so wasn\\'t sure that was an indicator that i was indeed working on tb. hi guys, i created a post few weeks ago regarding the hdr https://www.reddit.com/r/dellxps/comments/vnmkpl/xps_13_plus_oled_hdr_issue/ i tried more hdr video and i have clearer thoughts on this problem. i check the statistics of the videos, and turns out those video with overexposure and oversaturated issue are with hlg, while those with pq are fine. so i believe it is a design failure and need to be fixed. i know the computer defaults to using the integrated gpu for power saving but i mostly leave my computer plugged in and stationary. is there anyway i can force my laptop to always use the dgpu globally? i found a way to do it app by app but no global option. brand new xps 8950. the usb chipset in the motherboard doesn’t want to cooperate with my motu ultralite audio interface (experiencing lots of audio glitches). motu suggests installing a usb expansion card with an asmedia controller. this is what i purchased. is there any reason other than the fact that this thing might be junk that my computer won’t recognize it? i’ve confirmed it’s getting power but windows doesn’t show it anywhere in the device manager. tia! recently i started looking for new laptop as i have sold my previous xps 15. narrowed down to 9510 with 4k screen. today i saw almost new 9510 with fhd screen (i7 etc) for under 1000 euros with 2 year warranty which is good deal. since i am coming from 4k screen xps and consider a must to have 9510 with 4k, wondering if 4k from 9500 will fit 9510 since i could buy 4k screen for ~ 350 euros. 9510 4k screens are hard/none to find. i just recently got an xps 13 plus, 3.5k, platinum. i mostly only use the laptop, as a laptop(no dock, external monitors, etc.). i love the look of the touchpad but however have problems with delayed haptic feedback. the delay gets worse when i two-finger press the further left i press on the touchpad. is it just me? hopefully a driver update will fix the delay. i received a dell xps 13 plus a few weeks ago after waiting nearly 2 months, and the speakers were popping each time when starting or stopping audio. i tried all sorts of things like drivers and ended up returning it and purchasing a new one, assuming it was just a hardware issue. i received the new one today and it was exactly the same out of the box. i did see that a new realtek audio driver had been released 2 days ago, so i hoped that would fix it. i’ve installed that along with all other updates and i do think it’s better, although it still makes this noise when changing the volume on the taskbar at the bottom right. the loud noise you hear preceding the windows sound isn’t the mouse or keyboard, it’s the speakers. the fact it’s better after the update makes me think it’s a driver/software issue, but if so it confuses me how no one else seems to have had this issue. has anyone got any suggestions/had a similar problem? have had my xps for nearly 2 years and this issue has been happening on and off but recently it happens every 1-2 days. i\\'ll leave the laptop to go into energy saving/sleep mode and when i come back to it the keyboard backlights will turn on but the screen won\\'t. only way i\\'ve figured out how to get it to work is full power off by holding power button but then i lose all my open shit and get a message telling me it wasn\\'t shut down properly. anyone know how to fix this? thanks in advance! might this mean that the volume is muted? if so, that’s pretty cool. i haven’t seen other colors on it before. if it’s a bug then it’s a weird one this is the backlight on a platinum xps 13 9320 plus at full brightness setting in daylight. i find it extremely difficult to make out the keys, as the light doesn\\'t seem to be bright enough to actually illuminate them. i didn\\'t have this problem at all on my 9310 (helped, no doubt, by the black keys it had). is there any setting to make it brighter? (i also note that the backlight is very patchy - e.g. the dark spot in the middle of the backspace key, the bright spot and dark edges of the caps lock key, some keys being brighter than others, some keys being brighter on one side than the other. again, not a problem i had on my 9310 and something i wouldn\\'t expect on a laptop costing this much) you can try reinstalling audio drivers and if that doesn\\'t work do a clean install of windows. just got a new 9520 and obviously have the touchpad special attention after reading about previous models. the bottom right section of my touchpad is slightly lower than the left, neither of which sit flush perfectly with the palm rest like i thought they would, is this normal? thanks looking to upgrade my xps from 16gb to 32gb but want to make sure the ram i get is of equal or faster speed. what has everyone found to be the best ram for this little laptop? i found another thread on here but it was a bit old and i couldbt follow the different speed ratings. thank you congrats, awesome machine indeed. received mine this weekend and i\\'m extremely happy with it so far. \\u200b enjoy! i just got my xps 13 plus a few days ago and now the touchpad is not working and i am unsure how to get it to work again. (i am also new to using laptops so not sure if i can manually do it or if the xps itself is broken) any advise is appreciated. edit: after pressing fn and every f key possible and shutting down the device ten times it randomly decided to work again? no idea why it happened or how i got it back. i’ve had an interesting experience this past week or so. i usually change to ahci mode on dell laptops, as performance is no different and i don’t have to mess about with raid drivers on the fresh install. i did the same on my 9320 when it arrived, and ran into an issue where it wouldn’t boot on first attempt, but would on second. it was a bit annoying but when it booted it was fine. i looked into it, and got pointed to fastboot so disabled that to no joy. i benched in crystaldiskmark 4800mbps which is under that rated 6600mbps of the sn810 it came with. this morning i reinstalled win 11 in raid mode, and what a difference. crystal is reporting 6800mbps and the booting issue is now gone. im not sure if it’s because these things are using pcie4 but going with raid and using the intel rst drivers makes a huge difference with the 9320. i also discovered that windows 11 recovery console cannot read the ssd. usually it can, but i’m guessing the controller is newer than the inbuilt drivers are at the minute. could you elaborate? been considering the 9710 hi everyone! i\\'m coming from a 2017 xps 15 (9560) that finally began to encounter consistent video dxgkrnl fatal errors so i bit the bullet and bought the new xps 15! however... i\\'m having serious buyer\\'s remorse. i spent about $2700 usd (i9-12900hk / rtx 3050ti / 32gb ram / 1tb ssd / fhd non-touch) in the hopes that this laptop will last me another 5-6 years. but for the high price, i\\'m reading so much conflicting information about the thermal management, battery life, etc. and how there are much better \"competitors\" out on the market. should i have gone with a different spec setup to \"future-proof\" my new 9520? should i have gone with the 13 or the 17? my brain is on overdrive!! edit - forgot to mention that my current uses are internet browsing, netflix/youtube, and python mostly in vs code (not using ubuntu so not a concern). and 60% of the time i\\'d be docking the laptop to dual external monitors. holy hell, i am hoping it doesn\\'t catch fire and so much for the battery life. i was wondering if anyone is having problems with their xps 13 plus cause i need a new (powerful) laptop and i really like the design. don\\'t know whether to buy a dell or a 2022 lg gram which also looks really good and is a bit cheaper but more powerful at the same time...if it wasn\\'t for dell\\'s non-existent quality control i\\'d probably get an xps right away though i recently noticed my nvidia control panel was gone, did some investigating and via device manager the \\'device is not connected to the system - error 45\\'. \\u200b i have never seen an erro on a laptop like this, attempting to reinstall the drivers does not help since it says no device exists. \\u200b is this a firmware issue or hardware issue? hi, on my xps 13 9310, i\\'ve tried updating the bios 4 ways: --via dell update --via the downloaded .exe from dell support --via windows update optional updates --directly through the bios (doesn\\'t recognize my usb drive) \\u200b every time, it seems to run successfully, but when i reboot, it doesn\\'t do the update -- it just boots back into windows. \\u200b is anybody else experiencing this? there\\'s no error reported, the bios update just does.... nothing. \\u200b thanks! i just got my dell xps 8950 and i bought ram to upgrade it. for some reason i can’t wrap my head around which slots to use for two sticks of ram so they operate in dual channel. on the motherboard there are four ram slots, the colors of the latches are black, white, black, white. when i received the computer it had two 8gb sticks in the two white slots. do i need to install my ram in the white slots, or do i install them in one black and one white slot? this is what i don’t seem to understand. tia. hi, i recently bought the 8950 with the i7-12700 and standard air cooling for my first gaming/content creation desktop since it was on sale just within my budget. it\\'s pretty great overall and i love it so far, but i\\'m hitting high temps more than i\\'d like to. my cpu hit 95-100 when streaming a resource intensive game, and even without streaming, it was still reaching 85-95. though it never shut itself off, i don\\'t want to keep pushing it and would rather play it safe. even when i just have a few tabs open it hangs around 40-45, which from what i\\'ve seen seems to be somewhat above average. i\\'m planning to replace the stock cpu cooler with an nh-u9s when i can, but should i reapply thermal paste in the meantime? is there a chance it wasn\\'t applied the best and i could get better temps before i buy the upgrade? i see some users in this subreddit and some reviews report xps 13 plus have heating issue. i am currently using xps 13 9360 (2017) which i use in my lap most of the time. i am from india and xps 13 plus here is only available for business users which have no return policy. i can not return it if it gets hot. can xps 13 plus used in a lap or should i wait for new xps 13 (with 12th gen) to be available in my country? backstory: i have prosupport on my xps 9710. it expires in a couple of weeks. so i wanted to get my wobbly unresponsive touch pad fixed. now: unisys came out and replaced it and the wrist rest. long story short it didn\\'t work. as in, the laptop wouldn\\'t turn back on. so they sent out another tech to replace the lcd, mem, fan, motherboard, basically everything else. advice? should i contact support and demand a new laptop? i am worried that the laptop is so tweaked and worked on that i will have some kind of issue down the road after my warranty expires. i was browsing on dell\\'s page, and i noticed there\\'s no more option for a non-touch display for the new xps plus (9320) ... anyone have any idea why? i am still waiting on one i ordered with the non-touch screen, so i\\'m wondering if (a) i\\'ll still get it and (b) if they stopped because of a known-issue or something with the non-touch screens? any ideas would be helpful! not available on the i5 or either i7 models my original xps 9520, delivered mid june, had a 500gb wd sn810 nvme in it. i had the ui/video lag issue (which i posted about extensively in another thread here), so was sent a replacement. this replacement (produced 1st week of july) has a 500gb micron 3400 nvme drive. i found it very odd that two laptops produced so close to each other would have different drives. the micron drive has different stats that the wd, faster reads but much lower random write iops, i don\\'t think i\\'ll see it in normal workloads, but curious what other people think. wd sn810: 6000 mb/s read / 4000mb/s write. 750k random read iops / 630k random write iops micron 3400: 6600 mb/s read / 3600mb/s write. 700k random read iops / 360k random write iops ram sticks are different too, i got samsung sticks in the new one, and the old one had micron sticks. same timings though. getting slightly higher cinebench scores on this, although oddly enough the 3dmark time spy cpu scores are lower (but gpu scores consistent with my existing machine) saw one ar microcenter recently the trackpad is even bigger then i thought looks like i\\'m one of the folks having issues with the touch bar. it definitely looks like heat is the cause of the issue. this is my second day with the device. i\\'m still in the middle of setting it up for work. in my normal work state the device is docked and closed. so using an external keyboard then and what not. however, just undocked it and opened it up and f11 is being randomly pressed which is constantly toggling full screen mode. most of the buttons wont respond to touch at all. or will respond on the odd occasion. so, just installed 1.4.0 which dropped today. latencymon reports some significant differences in both dpc and irq latency. not had enough time to see if it fixes my \"crash after sleep\" problems yet, i\\'ll edit this comment as it goes on. i wanted to share an issue i experienced with my xps 9510 in hopes it could help someone else. sadly, this was one of a few issues i\\'ve had with this 9510. i\\'ve had the computer for a few months and it\\'s very lightly used (my other computers are my go-tos). the other day, the trackpad started acting up out of nowhere. movements seemed almost like they had a slight lag/jitter to them and the pointer seemed to lack precision. i went through all the usual troubleshooting steps with software and drivers. i even did a clean installation of windows for the heck of it. no luck. i reached out to dell and they determined the trackpad needs replacing and they would send a technician to perform the replacement (this would be the second xps of mine that\\'s needed a warranty trackpad replacement). anyway, after all was said and done, i started to wonder if i could maybe physically adjust the trackpad because mine is not well aligned from the factory (seriously, how is qc this bad on these machines?). all it took to resolve my issues? loosening two screws on the bottom of the chassis that seemed like they were screwed in by the hulk. now, my trackpad behaves as it should again. hopefully, this will help someone else experiencing this same issue down the road! hi, i got new xps 13+ few days ago, great machine by the way, but i want to ask you if someone tried installing fedora 36 on it? is webcam, auto brightness and touch bar working fine? does the dell xps 9320 oled uses pulse width modulation (pwm) to control brightness? i think the easiest way to find out is if you put your cell phone (if modern) camera on and act like you\\'re taking a photo of the screen - can you see bands flashing on the oled while looking at it through your camera app on the cell phone? my guess is it does have pwm. i am going to be starting some programming courses in the fall and am considering an xps as a new machine. i can get a good price on a 9510 but am also looking at the 9520. can anyone vouch for the 9510 or is the performance of the 20 that much better? while i will mostly be using it for coding in c#, i might also dabble in music with it. backstory: i have prosupport on my xps 9710. it expires in a couple of weeks. so i wanted to get my wobbly unresponsive touch pad fixed. now: unisys came out and replaced it and the wrist rest. long story short it didn\\'t work. as in, the laptop wouldn\\'t turn back on. so they sent out another tech to replace the lcd, mem, fan, motherboard, basically everything else. advice? should i contact support and demand a new laptop? i am worried that the laptop is so tweaked and worked on that i will have some kind of issue down the road after my warranty expires. any recommendations? i have the 9510 and that palm/touch surface gets kinda greasy looking quick. a mbp i’d just use ipa like hosing down a truck, but the soft matte surface on the xps i figure would erode fairly easily with any solvents. how long this laptop is supposed to last with a full charge ? i\\'m using pop os in 4k with brightness at around 80% and i can get around 3 hours. also after 1.5 years my battery capacity dropped to 86% it seems quite a lot to me. i have the intel i7 11800h / rtx 3050 model. so maybe i\\'m just crazy, it\\'s my first time buying a new laptop and tbh the first time i\\'ve had my own laptop. it arived today but i can\\'t halo but notice that it makes some....weird noices, i\\'m guessing it\\'s coilwind or something but....i\\'m scared that something is wrong. it\\'s very soft but loudest while in bios, am i the only one hearing this? does anybody here have any experience with the \"the fan failed to respond correctly\" error shown at the initialization proccess? i have been getting this sometimes when booting the xps 9520 up and i\\'m looking for info about what could be done to solve it. since i actually live in a country where dell doesn\\'t sell the xps 15 officially, getting their support would probably be just slow, inefficient and likely expensive, even with premium support tied to my laptop, which was bought through dell us. as far as i can tell, both fans are spinning fine and every full hardware diagnostics i\\'ve run were completed successfully, with no error whatsoever, be with the fans, sensors and whatnot. bios is updated as well. what i\\'m debating doing is buying a new pair of fans through ebay and replace them myself. i\\'m just wondering if this is somewhat common and if someone had experience with this kind of error lately and with more recent xps models, which could be helpful for me to correctly assess what is wrong and what could be done to solve. i do not need the pre-installed windows 11 home on my xps 13 plus because i\\'m using ubuntu linux on that machine. i\\'d like to transfer the windows license to another machine. is this possible technically? i know the license key is embedded into the bios – are there tools to extract it? i\\'d prefer a linux tool, but i guess windows would be fine as well. i know the battery life isn\\'t very good, but are there any other issues i should be worried about if i were to buy it? i\\'d be going with the oled model. https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/xps-desktop/spd/xps-8950-desktop/xd8950adl30h does not mention hdmi, but i would think that because it has a geforce 3600 i could expect an hdmi port. i would hope the sound could route through the hdmi port too. i suspect the geforce 3600 refers to the chipset, and i suspect i cannot assume what features the card would have. https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/desktops-all-in-one-pcs/xps-desktop/spd/xps-8950-desktop/smx8950w11ps180#features_section has intel uhd graphics 770. is there an hdmi port, or would i be limited to an aftermarket display port to hdmi cable with no audio? my use is not as a fps gamer; high frame rate is not my thing. i want fast m.2 pcie 4.0 performance-capable, but the supplied ssd would not need to ship with that. i find trying to read the descriptions to be difficult. so i have not totally moved away from \"building\" my own as i have for my last few desktops, but there is some advantage to buying the pre-built. an advantage of putting one together is that you get the specs and know what all of the ports are. recently updated to latest bios 1.10.1 and my thunderbolt monitor that i\\'ve used hundreds of times before is no longer detected, not even the usual chimes from windows that a device has been connected. anybody else experiencing thunderbolt issues after updating or have any workarounds? i can\\'t downgrade bios either apparently. hi all! i was given a dell xps 15 9520 for my work and i noticed it only came with a small dongle for usb 3.2 gen 2 type-c. however, i need additional ports to hook this laptop up to my bigger setup on my desk. this includes: two monitors (dell) ethernet port (internet) external webcam (usb) external mouse (usb) external keyboard (usb) external microphone (usb) can someone direct me to what i should get for this? is it a hub i can grab from amazon? would like to know the best solution. thank you! does anybody here have any experience with the \"the fan failed to respond correctly\" error shown at the initialization proccess? i have been getting this sometimes when booting the xps 9520 up and i\\'m looking for info about what could be done to solve it. since i actually live in a country where dell doesn\\'t sell the xps 15 officially, getting their support would probably be just slow, inefficient and likely expensive, even with premium support tied to my laptop, which was bought through dell us. as far as i can tell, both fans are spinning fine and every full hardware diagnostics i\\'ve run were completed successfully, with no error whatsoever, be with the fans, sensors and whatnot. bios is updated as well. what i\\'m debating doing is buying a new pair of fans through ebay and replace them myself. i\\'m just wondering if this is somewhat common and if someone had experience with this kind of error lately and with more recent xps models, which could be helpful for me to correctly assess what is wrong and what could be done to solve this. of course everybody is different, has different needs and your mileage may very depending on your use case. for me, i just needed a new laptop as asap that i could take with me anywhere, work on documents, web browsing and coding in pycharm. i also needed portable machine on which i could practice learning linux. initially i thought about buying m1 macbook air but learned arch linux arm version is not as good/developed as x86 version. so i ordered from dell decent last gen budget xps 9305 with base in dell outlets for under $650 with discount. all what i ordered extra was samsung 980 500mb, full size heatsink bracket with cooling thermal pads, and some cool dbrand skins. i replaced windows 11 home with arch linux running kde on wayland and installed windows 11 inside qemu/kvm. it runs so fast it runs circles around my work loaned intel macbook pro 2019 with i7 processor, definitely faster than my mac mini late 2014 with 8gb, 2.6ghz 2-core cpu with m2 ssd on monterey. it may not beat m1 in cpu benchmark but it beats itself after switching from windows to linux. my only regret is i could have spent little more money and maybe get 9310 with taller screen or 16gb ram. the machine is quite nice to use and pretty lightweight. the carbon surface feels nicer than aluminum. after i saw intel 12th gen xps laptop released i got jealous but on other hand i saved a lot of money and it is still plenty fast for me! hello, i am going into college and i was debating between these two dell laptops that i have linked below. i will list the important specs (you can find full list of specs on the links) for each and give my thoughts. i plan to use it for college stuff but i also want to be able to play games on it as well (i mostly play minecraft, but i have thought about playing other games like fps games or games on steam). from what i know, usually when people have the intent to game it puts a bit more emphasis on the graphics card and processor. https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-xps-15-laptop/spd/xps-15-9520-laptop/smx15w11p1c2800p dell xps 15 (price is $2649 right now): processor 12th generation intel® core™ i9-12900hk (24mb cache, up to 5.0 ghz, 14 cores) graphics cardnvidia® geforce rtx™ 3050 ti, 4 gb gddr6, 45 w display 15.6\", fhd+ 1920x1200, 60hz, non-touch, anti-glare, 500 nit, infinityedge memory *****32 gb, 2 x 16 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz, dual-channel hard drive1 tb, m.2, pcie nvme, ssd ports1 usb 3.2 gen 2 type-c™ (with displayport and powerdelivery)2 thunderbolt™ 4 (usb type-c™) with displayport and powerdelivery1 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo jack slots1 sd-card slot dimensions & weightheight : 0.73 in.

n/a leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. my thoughts: processor, memory, storage, and display are all the same. one major difference is the graphics card, and the xps 17 definitely has the better graphics card. however, the xps 17 is bigger at 17 in. and weighs up to 4.87 lbs, while the the xps 15 is only 15.6 in. and weighs up to 4.22 lbs. now, the weight and size has never really been an issue for me, but i\\'ve been warned that for college that you should get a laptop under 16 inches, but honestly i don\\'t know if i should care that much about it. also, the battery of the xps 17 is definitely more powerful than xps 15, but i\\'ve heard that larger laptops with beefier specs tend to use battery more quickly, so i don\\'t know if the battery of the xps 17 here is necessarily better (although the only major difference in specs really seems to be the graphics card). please leave a comment letting me know which one you think is better (and explain if you want)! i know the battery in the 13 plus isn\\'t very good, and i want the oled model, so would i be able to offset this by getting a powerbank that i can use to charge it on the go? would this be a better option than going for the 15? what\\'s the battery life like on the 15? i have a xps 13 (9310) laptop which came with a 45w charger connecting to a thunderbolt/usb-c port. i recently got a new usb-c hub: https://alogic.co/us/usb-c-ultra-dock-plus-gen-2-with-power-delivery.html which claims it has 100w power delivery in one of the usb-c ports which i hoped to be able to use to charge the power adapter into and charge the laptop so i could free up one of the thunderbolt ports. however when i connect the charger to the power delivery usb-c port on the usb-c hub it doesn\\'t appear to charge. is there an issue with my laptop/hub or something i need to configure to enable this? hi guys, need advice: i’m heading for an mba - i.e usage would require heavy use of ms office, extensive excel usage and lots of netflix streaming. is xps 13 a good choice? concerns: 1. would the screen be too small to work on? i do want portability as i will need to carry my laptop to classes, but don’t want to compromise on screen size either. i have never used a 13” display so curious. 2. is xps 9315 a good laptop? i do have an option of buying 9305. it has dual fans and more ports but screen is 16:9 aspect ratio. wondering if it might reduce productivity. will the dell xps 13 plus come to bestbuy in canada? i would prefer to see the device in person before i buy something so expensive. i recently bought the sceptre 25\" gaming monitor (e255b-fwd168) which goes up to 165hz (https://a.co/d/0e3sb6v). i connected it to my dell xps 15 9510 (2021 windows 11 model that is compatible with displayport 1.4), using a usb-c to displayport 1.4 cable, and i went into settings to change the refresh rate to 165hz. at first glance, it looked very smooth to me, but i didn’t have a side by side comparison with a 60hz display so i couldn’t verify if it was really 165hz. so i used some online tests: https://www.testufo.com/refreshrate: this test said my display was 65hz. https://devicetests.com/refresh-rate-test: this test said my display was 133hz. https://www.vsynctester.com/detect.html: this test said my display was 65hz. in conclusion, i don’t know for sure what my monitor’s refresh rate is and why it doesn’t go up to 165hz at all. any tips on how to get a true value for my refresh rate and/or how to actually reach 165hz? thanks! i will never forgive dell for removing the headphone jack from their flagship premium laptop. not sure what to do here - i\\'m using the provided charger (i\\'ve tried many others and i still see the same symbol). any idea what\\'s going on? i think i\\'m going to return this laptop - at nearly $2k usd i shouldn\\'t have to worry that the keyboard will press itself. it started happening when using the laptop normally, so i disconnected everything and turned bluetooth off to make sure it wasn\\'t my keyboard. i then re-started it into bios and went into diagnostic testing - the keyboard one and i could clearly see (in video) the touchbar keys pressing themselves. edit* after restarting twice this fixed itself. considering i\\'ve been using this laptop less than a week i find it completely unacceptable, and i\\'m willing to bet these problems will only get worse as time goes on. specifically the 3060 does anyone knows if the xps 13 plus (9320) in fhd+ (1200p) supports dolby vision or hdr? i can\\'t find any certain information on the web. thanks sure did. i ordered the i5, 16gb and dropped a few reviews about it, stand-alone, comparison with the plus and comparison with surface laptop. here’s the main 9315 video 😁. https://youtu.be/tjv5-jn-swm looking to see how i would go about this. not finding many items that list the length. alternatives? hello, dellxps. i\\'ve recently bought a new xps 15 9510 and i\\'ve realized that there are very few ports. i\\'ve been looking for adapters like these https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b07z4fp2vx/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=aovia3bfqymh&psc=1, but they\\'re made for macbooks. have anyone ever bought one of these adapters before and has it worked? if not, what adapters work for dell and is affordable? thank you! don\\'t know about gysnc support, but if it\\'s like the 9700 and 9710, there should be an igpu bypass option in the bios. don\\'t use my dell xps for a massive amount of gaming, but will play a bit of f1 2020 on it - yes it\\'s an \"old\" version of the game, but still basically as good/the same as f1 2022 and you\\'re not getting charged the silly money new aaa titles cost. can run it on top specs no issue and have done for months. issue now however is after about half an hour, it just slows right down - we\\'re talking silky smooth high fps down to about 2 fps if that. obviously unplayable. nothing obvious triggers this, will happen randomly right in the middle of a race/session. like a switch too, not like it\\'s under load and gradually deteriorates. anyone any ideas why? full specs - dell xps 15 9510 11th gen intel(r) core(tm) i7-11800h @ 2.30ghz 32.0 gb ram nvidia rtx3050 ti 1tb nvme drive in the laptop 1tb samsung t7 ssd with all steam data on - connected directly to the laptop via a usb 3.2 cable dell u2720q ultrasharp usb-c 27 inch 4k uhd display - connected to a separate usb 3.2 port and also has the keyboard and mouse plugged into it as it acts a \"hub\" laptop is plugged in via the remaining usb 3.2 port so not running on battery doesn\\'t get noticeably hot and task manager seems to suggest plenty of performance in reserve as an aside issue - using an xbox controller connected via bluetooth. this will randomly disconnect and reconnect about once every 20 minutes. annoying, but fortunately the game pauses and it takes about 5 seconds. could this all be down to something like the dreaded killer app? not even sure what it is, but hear plenty of noise about it, most of it bad. so in the bios (even 1.4), there’s an oc lvl 2 option. what exactly does it do and what are the performance gains? does upping the ram voltage in bios improve anything either? no one on google or in forums talks about this or tested it?! even jeeves said “lol wut?!” view poll i just received my xps 9520 yesterday and upon curiosity i opened task manager and realized it was using my processor’s integrated graphics despite me having an rtx 3050 ti…. anybody know why this is happening and how i can change it??? has anyone had any problems re-installing windows 10 to a 9520? would like to go with the 9520 but can’t use windows 11 yet due to some software issues. hi guys, i think this happened just recently, maybe 1 or 2 days ago. on the other hand, when i play any media, they are just fine without any crackling sounds. does anyone else experience this as well? edit# after did some driver updates, the crackling is gone this is the second or third time it happened after couple weeks. after computer goes to sleep, it won\\'t power on. the first time it happened, i unplugged from ac, battery, held power for 30s+ to drain power and it powered back on. another few months goes by and does it again but this time i was able to recover it just by holding for prolong period power button while plugged to ac adapter. when i received the computer i did comprehensive diagnostic test in uefi and it had no issues. i suspect since i purchased refurbished from dell outlet, it was probably returned for this reason but looks like dell just did basic testing and cleanup to put it back into inventory. i have dell 9305 with i5 processor, 8gb that i got for great discount. the laptop still works but its out of return period. i could try to file warranty claim, but probably will be hassled to go through basic software troubleshooting and asked for dell diagnostic/info logs from windows while i only run linux with windows vm running inside. for those who experienced this issue is this a sign of messed up power controller on the motherboard? should i proactively try to get dell to replace motherboard before my warranty expires next year? i have most recent uefi version installed in june. i have a 9710 charger and the light on it turns on indicating that it gets power. and works. but i leave it plugged in for a few days just in the wall the light will turn off. i have to manually unplug it and replug it in for it to start working again. anyone else have this issue or is it just a faulty charger? tldr - have been using my 9510 for one year today, it is easily the best laptop i have ever owned laptop arrived a year ago and i have been using it for work on a daily basis. i have it connected to a wd19 dock and it supports 3 dell p2715q monitors beautifully. i posted a photo my setup here the laptop is mounted under the desk https://www.reddit.com/r/dellxps/comments/orm7nr/my_xps_15_9510_wfh_setup_itemized_details_in/ pros never had to call dell\\'s support line for anything so i am letting the service plan lapse never experienced a bsod i feel i will be using this machine for several more years a good looking laptop that feels well put together. it looks also like it should be heavier than it actually is. cons system did not arrive fully patched and updated (not that i expected it to) . my origin pc desktop from 2018 arrived patched and up to date. had to grossly overpay for the wd19 on amazon as they were on back order from dell at the time bloatware galore system runs a little hot i was just wondering if anyone has gotten their new xps 13 yet as mine just got delayed 2 weeks when i’m using the speakers, the volume slider has no effect when not muted. volume is just loud, there’s no loudening or softening with the slider. don’t even know where to start on this. it’s a brand new computer. why doesn’t the volume slider work. hello i just received my new xps 17 9720 and i’m a little bit confused about the power options.. there is only balanced mode there , no high performance. so that means if i click on the battery icon and slide it all the way to the right to best performance that equal to the high performance that windows used to have ?? i need the full power of that laptop when i’m working on my music production software, in the past i will go to the high performance mode and to the “change advanced power settings “ and i will have all different types of settings to change , for example the min & max processor power management .. but under the balance mode there is not a lot options under advance settings. just wonder if sliding the slide all the way to the right on the battery icon and under dell power manager/ thermal management and chose ultra performance will give me the most power like the high performance mode ? also what settings you recommend me if the laptop charger are most of the time connected ? the primarily ac use in dell power manager ? thanks so much i recently ordered a dell xps 9520. i wasn\\'t able to afford the 4k oled screen or a 3050ti. my order has been delayed multiples times and i\\'m wondering if i should just buy the older model that\\'s currently on sale and cancel my current order? the cpu would be worse and i\\'d have less storage, but i\\'d get the 4k oled screen and a better gpu. my main usage will be video editing. would appreciate some thoughts :) curious how\\'s the performance of: - thermals (without the vapor chamber) - battery life thanks so i got my new xps 13 last week with the 1280p and my touch bar has stopped responding to touches in linux and windows, totally at random. this\\'ll be a fun support request but i might just return it and get a mac. the m series processors totally outclass this thing, maybe i\\'ll get used to macos. edit: i tried to do a full shutdown and startup and it didn\\'t do anything. however, i shut it off, let it sit for 15 minutes, started it and the touch bar works again! still not sure i\\'m keeping it though. hey all, it seems that there\\'s finally a fix for the stutter touchpad issues that have been plaguing the recent xps 15s. after updating the touchpad firmware on my xps 15 9510, it\\'s working flawlessly on linux as well up to now. for linux users you\\'ll need a dual boot to upgrade afaik. link : https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=4w96v&oscode=wt64a&productcode=xps-15-9510-laptop i haven\\'t been able to test it on other devices but the driver is also compatible with the following devices precision 5550 precision 5560 precision 5750 precision 5760 xps 15 9500 xps 15 9510 xps 17 9700 xps 17 9710 enjoy! hello i just received my new xps 17 9720 and i’m a little bit confused about the power options.. there is only balanced mode there , no high performance. so that means if i click on the battery icon and slide it all the way to the right to best performance that equal to the high performance that windows used to have ??

i want to buy a powerbank to power an xps 9520, what is the minimum voltage / wattage i should look for? hello, as said in the title i’m interested in buying a dell xps 15 9520 and i would love if any users of the laptop could help me out. i want to buy the i7 16gb 1tb with touch screen, nvidia® geforce rtx™ 3050 ti con memoria gddr6 de 4 gb, 45 w. i will use it for working on word and watching multimedia basically. and sometimes to play video games (maybe minecraft with a lot of mods and shaders) im concerned about the fan noise and the heat. i don’t mind if it gets loud and hot if i’m playing a video game but i’m scared about the productivity and multimedia part. i don’t want to hear the fans going crazy when i’m only watching youtube and writing an essay. could anyone that has this laptop tell me if the fans get loud? i know it’s a big laptop for what i need but i’m quite in love with it, and besides the huawei matebook 14s, i haven’t find anything that really calls me. only going to use windows btw, i will not do anything “advanced” with it. and btw i’m not a profesional so if there’s like really small things that only a professional would notice that’s fine with me, i just want a laptop that is fast and nice. thank you in advance and sorry if there’s any english mistakes, it’s not my first language. hi guys, i\\'ve just received my xps 15 9520 and wanted to set it up for work with a dual boot between win11 pro and ubuntu 22.04. went to download the iso file on canonical and started to boot from usb. everything is normal until i get to the first screen where you have to choose between try or install. the windows loads but not the contents and the computer stays frozen indefinitely. anyone had a similar issue or know how to bypass it ? the iso file is fine and this issue only appears on the dell. i\\'ve run a similar exercise on my old msi with the same bootable usb and it is working just fine. thanks! chatted with a sales agent on the dell site yesterday. he told me none of the xps 17 2022 configurations ship with vapor chamber cooling anymore. i was thinking of getting the 17\" instead of the 15\" for better performance (less throttling), and cooler and quieter operation. any opinions about this? hi all, i have a xps 15 9510 that i\\'ve owned for less than a year. i\\'m aware of the issues that come from the audio drivers- i\\'ve encountered them on multiple occasions and usually a clean reinstall of windows did the trick. this is however the first time i\\'ve noticed hardware issues. up until now, i used the laptop in clamshell mode, where i shoved the actual laptop somewhere else in a vertical position, while using external peripherals. i started to use the laptop\\'s screen a few days ago, and i\\'m noticing aggrevating sound distortion at certain frequencies. it sounds like something inside the laptop\\'s vibrating as the speakers do and causing the sound, and it seems to resonate around ~300 hz. i tested the speakers by playing the following youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urretyfsenc&t=69s&ab_channel=doctormix when played on my xps, this is what it sounds like: https://reddit.com/link/vswqk5/video/slwqoxhbnz991/player when played on my ipad (whose speaker is fine), this is what it sounds like: https://reddit.com/link/vswqk5/video/iiclxdwinz991/player the difference is clear, even when recorded with a phone microphone. the trembling/rattling sound is amplified when on zoom calls, or streaming videos (youtube, prime vid, netflix, etc.). i paid for dell\\'s premium support, and they have been very helpful. i spoke with an engineer over the phone last night, and they sent an engineer to replace my speakers to a new one. the problem still persists, and even after another clean windows install, i still hear that sound. after reading other posts, i\\'m strongly convinced that it\\'s a problem with a loose component inside the laptop. here\\'s what i\\'ve tried: factory resetting to original settings (via dell\\'s support assist application), clean install of windows 10/11 (generic windows 10/11, not dell-issued ones), (re)installing realtek drivers from dell\\'s download page, placing my hands over the keyboard and making sure that nothing vibrates. surprisingly the last one did some good, but i don\\'t want to keep my hands still on the keyboard every time i\\'m watching a youtube video. i asked dell for a replacement laptop, and they should be getting back to me soon. i wanted to see if this was a bad-luck kinda thing where some xps\\'s do this while others don\\'t, or if all xps\\'s have this issue. if it\\'s the former, the odds of me getting a replacement with the same problem seems pretty slim. if i do, i\\'ll just ask for another one until i get one that doesn\\'t rattle. if it\\'s the latter, my blood pressure would take a hit and i would not buy from dell again. it\\'s really a shame, since everything else about the laptop has been positive. i welcome everyone\\'s feedback! thanks in advance. hi everyone, i recently received the new xps with the i71260p cpu. in windows everything works really good, i installed a dual boot: windows + fedora, and i\\'m having some issues in fedora: - the webcam is not recognized by cheese. - the wifi is very slow and some times it just not works (but remains connected). i\\'ve this asus router: rt-ax86s https://www.asus.com/mx/networking-iot-servers/wifi-routers/asus-gaming-routers/rt-ax86u/techspec/ i think it is a compatibilty problem with the router, but i shared the wifi from my phone to the xps and it behaves almost the same. i guess there are some problems with the drivers, i\\'ve tried enabling and disabling the 802.11ax and 1600mhz bandwidth in the router, also tried connecting to the 2.4ghz wifi but nothing changes. any advices? some of you are having similar problems? got a shiny new dell xps 13 plus (9320 model) today and i really like it, actually i\\'m also positively surprised about how \"natural\" this \"invisible\" touch pad feels. as i need quite a bit of disc space i got a model with a 2 tb m.2 drive and to be honest i\\'m a bit disappointed by the disk performance. that\\'s the test results i got from passmark after updating all system drivers without any other programs running the background: https://www.passmark.com/baselines/v10/display.php?id=159147237593 i would really appreciate if one of the other xps 13 plus owners here could confirm if these - in my opinion pretty bad values for a pcie 4 device - are comparable with yours or something is wrong with my device here: disk sequential read 2,022 mbytes/sec disk sequential write 2,023 mbytes/sec iops 32kqd20 2,393 mbytes/sec iops 4kqd1 77 mbytes/sec and if somebody else is here with a 2 tb m.2 drive as well, i would be curious if you also got the \"nvme pc801 nvme sk hynix 2tb\" model i have here. thanks in advance for any comments! andreas do the xps 15 4k and fullhd models have difference in bezel wideness? if so, how noticeable is it? specifically the 9510 and 9520 models. hi, because the precision 5570 shares the same motherboard with the xps 9520, i am interested in the official ubuntu linux 20.04 image from dell - with their \\'oem-specific\\' additions. dell support can\\'t help me with this... - can anyone share the official dell precision 5570 ubuntu linux recovery-image? or can anyone shares a support-tag from a precision 5570 with ubuntu linux? kind regard! i\\'ve ordered an xps 13 plus with windows although it\\'s clear i will use it with ubuntu exclusively. (the ubuntu option wasn\\'t available for that particular hardware configuration.) what\\'s the best way to preserve the windows installation that comes with the machine? does it come with a recovery image of some sort? if i use a disc imager, how large will the image approximately be? i\\'d like to be able to \"factory reset\" the machine in case i sell it, or need to use the warranty. also, is it technically possible to transfer the windows license to a different computer, e.g. a new gaming pc? i just got my dell xps 9520 delivered. just want to know what i should do to improve battery life and performance. also, if anyone can guide me how i can go about installing linux on this machine. thank you for your help. configuration: i7-12700h, rtx 3050, 16gb + 512ssd. i heard we could upgrade the ram but i see many posts on how most are incompatible. any suggestions for ram that successfully worked on 9520? i ordered a new xps 8950 desktop from dell on monday to take advantage of the 4th of july sale. i read the forums and knew going into it that i should expect massive delays. i\\'m cool with that. i\\'m in no rush and i understand a lot of the shipping issues from china as well as product shortages are not dell\\'s fault. i fully expected what i read on the forums before purchasing: 3-4 week delivery date that would be pushed back a month or 2 for a likely total of 3 months. \\u200b odd thing is, i was told it would be delivered by next wednesday with expedited shipping (even without expedited shipping it was telling me thursday). i admit i thought it was weird to promise it so soon, but i chalked it up to a lie. i\\'ve been reading the forums more and i notice that all of the delivery complaints on the forums seem to be exclusive to alienware products, which the xps is not. it also entered production yesterday. 24 hour turn around... my hopes are growing. searched for forum and reddit posts about delivery woes for the xps 8950 and there isn\\'t much after january. even the january deliveries don\\'t seem nearly as bad as the alienware stuff. people reported delays of 2-3 weeks. not terrible compared to the horror stories for alienware. dare i get my hopes up? or should i expect similar issues as what other customers have said? if anyone got a recently delivered dell desktop then i\\'d love to hear about your shipping experience, good or bad. my suspicion is that the laptops are the subject of more delivery issues than desktops. i\\'m in the eastern u.s, for clarity. thanks. what drivers besides the rst vmd drivers should i need to clean install windows 11? apparently this driver isn\\'t the only one required to install windows 11. using raid on vs achi/nvme mode makes no difference here. hey guys, looking at picking up a refurb xps-13 9300 / 9310 model, and was curious if the s3 sleep issues are fixed? planning on running linux and want to make sure my laptop sleeps correctly. thanks. i want to perform a clean install on a new xps plus 9320 but i don\\'t know what disk drivers i need to install during windows 11 install? what drivers do i need to load during the windows clean install option on usb drive. hi guys, although xps 13 9305 is not good with games, i still own some steam games which i play often with lower settings on my xps. but the fact that my xps came with 500gb ssd, i want to expand the storage not by replacing the existing ssd but with an external storage. given that the laptop has thunderbolt 4 port and also an usb c port (if that helps), are there any storage devices that are on par with the internal one and on which i can play my games directly from? i have made a review of macbook air m2 vs. dell xps 13. read it if you want to choose one of the best 13 inch laptopin the market. has anyone found any aftermarket ram that actually works in the xps 15 9520? i tried both crucial 64gb kit (2 x 32gb) ddr5-4800 sodimm ct2k32g48c40s5 and corsair cmsx64gx5m2a4800c40 both are ddr5 4800 mhz, the laptop wont post with either set, or single. original ram from dell posts fine, but i didnt want to spend the $1000 extra for 64gb. just reinstalled windows 11 from usb and wanted to give a head\\'s up to folks doing the same. my installwould not detect the wifi adapter during setup. this is the part of the install where you login to your ms account etc. fortunately i had a type-c ethernet adapter with me and was able to hard-wire to my router. so, keep an ethernet adapter handy if you want to go with a fresh install. i\\'ve been waiting for several months for 9520 to have the option of uhd+, white interior and i7. i check the website every two days, but it\\'s just not there. ughhhhhhh. i guess i\\'ll keep using my 9550. what are the things that folks are checking once they receive their xps 9320 laptops? i am planning to update the firmware/bios and software updates and then want to run a hardware check before resetting to fresh win 11 install. any recommendations/ links to must have accessories for the plus model? does anyone have a spare power cable (internal sata multi power cable that connects to motherboard)? i’ve tried searching for the model on the tag with no luck (0n00x2) i\\'m curious as to why it is cheaper? isn\\'t it better? additionally, how different are the two? is there a difference in regards to battery life and heat/thermals? thanks! hi. i recently upgraded to 9520. i still have my old dock (wd19tb) if i lock my pc and leave it for 5-10 minutes, it will have turned off output to dock (black screens) and be irresponsive (and then restart after a bit), or simply have restarted on its own. i have tried disabling automatic sleep when plugged in in windows settings, and to no help. anyone had similar issue? i recently received my dell xps 13 plus, and it has been great except for one thing. whenever i turn on the laptop there is a fan noise that sounds like something is hitting the fan for like 1 second. when i am using the laptop if i listen closely to the fan, i can hear a small faint sound that sounds like something is hitting the blades. with that being said, the noise is not noticeable when at a normal sitting distance. i have the videos linked below, please take a listen. i don\\'t know if i should return because besides that, there are no issues that others have been experiencing with the computer and it works just as it should. please let me know all your opinions down below. the specs : -fhd screen -i7 1280p -32gb of ram - 1tb ssd https://imgur.com/a/8eiqrc3 when docked into my d6000 driving 2 monitors the laptop will produce a coil whine. if i connect the included charger at the same time the coil whine will stop. this coil whine is only happening when docked. i don\\'t have any other docks to test with. anyone getting the same? is there a compatible dock that will not cause the same issue? i assume it needs to deliver more power to the laptop. hello. i have been experiencing issues with my new dell xps 13 plus. the haptic feedback from the trackpad is malfunctioning. when i first got the laptop 6 days ago it worked perfectly fine. 2 days ago at night all of a sudden the right side of the trackpad was making a higher pitched clicking sound so i shut it off and went to bed. the next morning the entire trackpad is experiencing the same higher pitched haptic feedback. and on top of that if i wanted to use the trackpad it acts as if i am always holding down the left click button (ex. moving my mouse across the desktop would also draw that light blue rectangle that windows uses to select things.) i updated every driver that wasn’t up to date straight from dell and windows is completely up to date as well. another user recommended i turn off right click in the bottom right hand corner of the touchpad in windows settings. this fixed the issue of having the left mouse button being held down unintentionally but the muted high pitched haptic feedback remains. it honestly ruins the experience for me. when i click it makes the high pitched sound but i don’t actually feel barely any feedback on my finger. i think it may be a hardware issue but has anyone found a solution? or any thing they recommend to try and fix it? thanks! i reduced my temps from nearly 100 degrees at boot by minus 10 degrees c. i am not aware of an xps 13 9310 2-in-1 (intel 11th gen) thermal re-paste walk-through, so decided it would be good to create one with the actual info to complete. the vapor chamber removal is where i was scratching my head on what to do next, until i discovered that the procedure is identical to the 7390. this is not part of dell\\'s public documentation unfortunately. please note that this procedure requires you remove the main board. this is not especially difficult, but it is an additional step, compared to the non 2-in-1 variant. here are my min and max temp after the work. note that i am currently set to ultra performance for thermals, so it\\'s all set to the max, in terms of no software based cpu throttle. given what i learned from this, a re-paste is something i would recommend on any laptop as factory is really, really bad unfortunately. i hope you find this useful and please feel free to post your own ideas or results.

vapor chamber removal i found this amazing video for the 7390, which is identical to the 9310. this video is a full walk-through. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdrbweas-yw i included a picture of one particular long screw, because there is a plastic washer underneath, which you don\\'t know is there unless you happen to notice it. it will attach to the threads of the screw, so you can ideally leave it in the locked position and no need to pull it out after you unscrew, unlike what is shown in the picture. the screws that go into the plastic areas of the fans should be lightly tightened only, as the plastic of fan will just collapse. it is incredibly soft. more than i have seen on other plastics. so be warned of this. the \\'long screw\\' picture below, you can see where there is a screw missing, which is because that part of the fan literally just split and fell off when i tightened the screw. one thing i noticed about this laptop is that the large black 1tb ssd chip to the right of the cpu, is a major source of heat, which often comes through the keyboard at similar high temp to the cpu. but i\\'m wondering if the heat pad on-top would be better served by a direct copper shim, or a thermal putty. i think it should be cooler, but maybe that\\'s what you get from pcie x4 nvme.

i\\'m facing several problems: the laptop has charging problems, sometimes it says the charger charges too slow (even though i got the 130w charger from dell), sometimes it doesn\\'t charge at all, and so on. really annoying. already spent 2 hours talking to a very motivated dell support engineer who ran bios updates, among others remotely via the \"dell update\" app. this helped, but didn\\'t completely mitigate the problem. but i can live with that for now, due to home office. the second problem which really drives me crazy is the usb-c slots: i come from a 14\" acer laptop with only 1 usb-c slot. but this was enough. via a 3rd party docking station bought on amazon to which i connected 2 x 27\" dell screens via hdmi, the charger via power delivery, as well as speakers and a webcam, i ended up with just one usb-c cable plugged into the laptop leading to a very clean desk setup. on the other hand, the new dell laptop is really stubborn: i thought i just could run my one-cable solution there, too, but no: before the support ran the bios, graphics card etc. updates, at least the two screens still worked when plugged into the docking station, but the webcam and speakers didn\\'t. after the update, the screens aren\\'t detected anymore when plugged into the docking station but the speakers and the webcam are. in order to be able to connect to the screens, i have to use separate usb-c connections for each screen from hdmi to usb-c. this means instead of just using one usb-c cable like in my old setup i now got 3 usb-c docking stations going into my new dell laptop which is unclean as hell. do you guys have any idea how i could fix this problem? already googled a lot but haven\\'t achieved any results. your help is much appreciated! i got the same color because i knew the letters of the keyboard would be hard to read in good lighting with the silver color based on last experience. i\\'m glad i did; it also looks sleek and elegant! i just found it yesterday occasionally when i mistype fn and ctrl fn + r = printscreen fn + s = scroll lock fn + b = break documented here : https://dl.dell.com/topicspdf/xps-15-9510-laptop_users-guide_en-us.pdf (page 20) and!! thanks god (undocumented) fn + left arrow = home fn + right arrow = end hey all, not sure if i should chalk it up to all of the updates and whatnot, but wanted to see if anyone else has been experiencing this? hi y\\'all, i got my xps 9520 a little over a month ago and it\\'s mostly been great. one thing that annoys me is a gap between the body and the display of the laptop, when it is fully closed. pics this gap is equal on both sides. when i pick the laptop up the top bends quite a bit closing the gap which doesn\\'t feel good. is this supposed to look like this or might it have been damaged in shipping? another problem i\\'ve had is that the wifi range is very poor, it gets outperformed by my phone (iphone xr) and 6 year old dell (latitude e5450). the 5ghz often works better than the 2.4ghz band even when i\\'m far away from the router and behind walls. does anyone have a similar experience with their wifi? hello, just bought a 9720 for my dad. i have a couple of precision 5550 that i really like. i am hoping to be able to downgrade from w11 to w10. i can\\'t seem to find the proper drivers to identify the storage during the install. i have a 9710, the intel rapid storage technology drivers works for this system but i am not able to find the same drivers for the 9720. has anyone had success installing w10 on a 9720? there is a noticable difference going from 10 to 11, my dad is 76, i want to give him a laptop that he is familiar with. thanks! xps 15 9510, bought new a little less than a year ago. i was having audio problems before, but that was entirely software-related. now i\\'m having what i believe to be a hardware issue. i\\'m sure it\\'s not my headphones. i\\'m sure it\\'s not bluetooth-related because i\\'m having the issue with and without bluetooth turned on. so, the issue is that the audio to my headphones keeps cutting out. when i wiggle the headphone jack, the audio starts to cut out on the left ear. therefore, i believe that this is a hardware issue. what can be done? what should i do? \\u200b edit: i contacted support today. they determined that this is indeed a hardware issue. since i\\'m still under warranty, they\\'re apparently going to be sending somebody out to repair the audio port. edit 2: the backplate was replaced. audio seems to be working fine when headphones are plugged in, but only time will tell if it\\'s a true fix. there\\'s still the issue of the headphones not being recognized by windows when they\\'re plugged in. he said this is a known issue when windows or drivers get updated. i\\'ve been down that road before, so i\\'m not sure this issue will ever be resolved. still, though, temporary or not, the hardware side has been fixed. dell xps 17 2022 on sale . this model comes with i7,3060,16gb ddr5,1080p- original price is 2499. i can buy this for 2100$. same configuration alienware x14 with 32gb ram going for 1900$. this where i am stuck. do i save couple of hundred dollars and buy alienware or buy xps. if xps 17 got better battery life then i will go with xps. i’ve shortlisted the xps 13/xps 13 plus as a potential laptop to buy but am worried about all the talk i’ve heard of overheating, throttling and the myriad of other issues. is it really something i should be worried about or does it happen only rarely under high workloads? my issue is that i tried to register my fingerprint for windows hello sign-in, the button didn’t work. however, i realised the whole power button unit does not work as pressing it doesn’t do anything. is there anything i can do to try and fix it before i try getting it repaired? hi y\\'all, i got my xps 9520 a little over a month ago and it\\'s mostly been great. one thing that annoys me is a gap between the body and the display of the laptop, when it is fully closed. pics this gap is equal on both sides. when i pick the laptop up the top bends quite a bit closing the gap which doesn\\'t feel good. is this supposed to

e5450). the 5ghz often works better than the 2.4ghz band even when i\\'m far away from the router and behind walls. does anyone have a similar experience with their wifi? so i picked up bf2042 again (still a bad game btw) after a windows 11 update and my xps 15 9510 hibernates whenever the fan turns on excessively and shuts down the screen and operations. this wasn\\'t an issue before i updated windows, where i could play hours at a time. but now, after a 20 minute session, the laptop just seems to overheat and turn off. i\\'m connected with a tb3 dock to an external monitor, power settings are set to max performance. the fan is operating at max capacity before hibernation. hi everyone, i just got the new xps 13 plus. for the first few days it was working fine but today i’ve had to restart my laptop twice because the trackpad seems to glitch and turns my touch automatically into a right click. i also can here the haptic motor stay in a infinite loop of sort which only goes away after i reboot the laptop. anyone else seen this issue? i experienced hissing sound when using headphone under linux (tested with ubuntu, fedora and debian live iso) on my xps 13 9305. this problem do happen under vanilla windows with the microsoft hd audio driver. it is just not acceptable for such an expensive model having this issue. do everyone have similar issue as me? hi everyone, i just got the new xps 13 plus. for the first few days it was working fine but today i’ve had to restart my laptop twice because the trackpad seems to glitch and turns my touch automatically into a right click. i also can here the haptic motor stay in a infinite loop of sort which only goes away after i reboot the laptop. anyone else seen this issue? it\\'s dell xps 13 9310 2021 got my 9320 on friday, oled model. i noticed what looks like a dead pixel, managed to get this photo. is this dead pixels? how is dell for replacing the panel? (uk) mine is doing much of the same crap. the real issue i see is that this guy says he is ok with 2ghz base clock on this with an egpu. that’s unacceptable. the 1165g7 in the surface laptop 4 can push over 4ghz all day as can the surface pro 8. this thing should easily be able to beat that especially if any of the reviewers reviews are to be believed, either that or the machine is tuned specifically to score high in cinebench and then shut the bed in everything else. i’m taking my current one to exchange for another to see how that one does. i got a 13 inch xps oled 9310 with i7 cpu and 16 gigs of ram on windows 10 pro as my work laptop and the performance has been terrible. i’m not sure if i’m doing something wrong or if i’m just expecting too much from it. when i open the lid it takes about 90 seconds to start up even if i just closed the lid, and when it’s open the fans are always on and the bottom is hot to the touch, even when there are no programs open. i would understand the slow wake up if it was going into battery saving deep sleep, but even when closed it drains the battery from full to empty within 4 days of never being used. my last laptop was a 2015 macbook air with an i5 and 8 gigs of ram and it always woke up within seconds and wouldn’t warm up unless i was running a ton of programs and had 20 tabs open in safari. another annoyance is that it keeps trying to auto install windows 11, with no way to opt out except to postpone. could this be causing poor performance? does anyone of you has experience with the new xps 13 plus charging with 40w? does it work? my lg screen provides a max power supply of 40w and i\\'m wondering wheter i need a new one, to avoid having to plug in my dell charger (60w), too. ever since i got this i have had nothing but audio issues, sometimes speakers work, sometimes they don\\'t, sometimes headphones work sometimes it refuses to detect them at all. anyone else having issues with audio and a possible solution? thank you! hardware seems to be fine, seems driver related. anyone else having laggy oled screen? feels like refresh rate is maybe 24hz instead of 60hz. opening and closing, moving windows, nothing is fluent. both hdr on and off. it\\'s not as laggy without hdr but then there\\'s other issue: there\\'s weird \"adaptive brightness\" happening around windows\\' when hdr is off. hdr off \\u200b hdr on i got latest display drivers for both intel gpu and nvidia. i reviewed the 9315 and 9320 separately, and threw up a comparison so you can see the various configurations and how they affect things for anyone wondering which way to go. here’s the comparison link for starters (https://youtu.be/j-lql2v0j5m) if you’d like to see the 4k and fhd screens side by side. alright, i recently got a dell xps 15 9510 laptop and i\\'ve had the same couple of issues that i cannot seem to find solutions to. for one, my laptop screen will occasionally completely freeze, and all keyboard inputs will not be responsive. i cannot restart the display driver with ctrl+windows+shift+b, and i cannot even run ctrl+alt+del. the only way i can fix the freeze is by manually hard restarting the laptop with the power button. secondly, every time my laptop goes into sleep mode for longer than a moment, the laptop will not respond to any \"wake up\" movements. i cannot get the computer to turn on after sleep and i have to hold down the power button in order to get the computer to turn on, which pretty much does a restart on it anyways. it\\'s quite frustrating to have these issues come up again and again, and not be able to find anything that has worked for me. i\\'m considering returning the laptop completely, but i want to see if anyone here has any ideas for fixes. i have an xps 13 9310 (16gb, i7-1185g7, fhd+) which i like a lot but it\\'s faulty, and i\\'ve been offered a 9320 plus (16gb, i7-1260p, fhd+) as a replacement under warranty i\\'m an academic so i write a lot, i also take a lot of photos and i listen to a lot of music and i play some games. other than that i mostly use it for dossing around online. the lack of sd card slot or headphone socket is potentially a problem for me. i\\'ve also seen conflicting opinions on the keyboard - some say you more or less get used to it, others say it\\'s not great if you write a lot. i\\'m not convinced about the touch bar thing they\\'ve gone with - particularly as i understand that you can\\'t dim or turn off the backlight on it? i use my laptop a lot in the evenings and with low light, so that might get annoying quite quickly. i\\'ve also read that the plus gets very hot, and can be hot even at idle, which may be an issue as i often work with it on my lap. on the other hand, the plus looks beautiful, the performance of the 12th gen cpus is great, and i\\'m intrigued by what they\\'ve done with the touchpad. and the battery life surely can\\'t be worse than the 9310 (which was a major downgrade in that department on the 9360 i had before) is there anything else i should know about the plus? if anyone owns one or has used one - what has been good and bad about it? what might be a dealbreaker for someone who carries their laptop around with them everywhere and writes a lot? what might be an annoyance or an inconvenience that could become an issue over time? is there anything that stands out as a positive? this might not be new information to everyone, but just as an fyi, the 9510 with i7/16gb/512gb/3050ti/white/oled is on sale for 1679 + you can use 100off499 for a further discount. reasons to get the 9510 over the 9520? higher wattage gpu, allows undervolting still. you can\\'t uv 12th gen, which is more power hungry as well. running -100mv stable and battery life at 50% brightness is 7:30 of actual browsing/yt/office usage. i\\'m pleasantly surprised. just trying to figure out an issue. got my xps 13 plus today. hooked it into my dock which is connected to 2 4k monitors. for some reason, one of them is limited to 1080p. by process of elimination, i\\'ve discovered the problem is the type-c to hdmi 2.1 adapter, which even when plugged directly into the laptop still only offers 1080p. but the adapter is fine, when connected to my macbook, i get 4k output. when that same adapter is returned to the dock and then plugged into the mac, i still get 4k output. yet when the dock, or the hdmi adapter separately, are plugged into the dell, i only get 1080. this is weird because my other 4k monitor connected via type c, also through the dock, can do 4k 144hz. there\\'s no bandwidth issue, because even when the second display is connected, i still only get 1080p on the primary display. any ideas? i have had this laptop for a few days and it\\'s sad to see a $2k + laptop lagging and freezing just doing normal work on battery. i restarted the laptop did every update and it\\'s still lag while am working on a office suite or something. i am thinking of sending it back tbh. i don\\'t know if anyone experience any lag in their work flow hello, i\\'m a software engineer about to buy a new dell xps. i\\'m trying to decide between the 15 inch oled display against the 17 inch with the better rtx 9060 graphics card at full 4k. anyone have any suggestions? price doesn\\'t really matter, i\\'m just wondering if the oled display will be better even with the worse gpu. all other specs on the machine will be maxed out. thanks! a little bit disappointing to receive your new gadget with some issues but the premium support does really a good job (until now). now i am waiting for the technician schedule a day to repair. how it looks: https://imgur.com/a/pwubybt hi, can anyone who with the xps 13 plus oled (or anyone with xps oled display) help me check if this video looks fine on your laptop with hdr on? on the first frame it will be oversaturated and overexposed... https://youtu.be/hrdqhavinee i got two xps 13 plus oled and both of them cannot present the hdr correctly. but some hdr content are looks fine. i also tried forza horizon 4 demo, didn\\'t work on hdr (it was overexposed) either... i did contact dell support but they cannot resolve the issue. \\u200b i use my phone take some photos, \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on i\\'ve had this 9320 for two days (12th gen i7, 16gb, 1 tb, oled touch) and i\\'m so disappointed in the battery life. it looks like 4-5 hours tops and it runs hot even in cool mode. i\\'m thinking this is not the machine for me. maybe i missed something in the early reviews. i have a 6 year old surface book 1 i7 that has similar if not longer battery life. are there other xps 13s that would be more optimized for portability (much longer battery and run somewhat cool) or do i need to be looking elsewhere? i\\'ve not really entertained buying a new macbook, but dang, this has me thinking... the surface book has touch and 4k, so i don\\'t want to take a step backwards. thanks! im looking to buy a new laptop. im trying to decide between the 9710 for $1700, or the 9720 for $2300. the main factor for me is the cpu and real word performance. i dont game so gpu isnt a factor. i need it for automation testing for my work which basically involves launching lots of browsers at once, open a few small virtual machines, compile code, ect... the 9710 has the 11800h which scores about 12000 in r23 with undervolting and goes down to about 10000 during sustained synthentic load. the 9720\\'s 12700h scores about 17000, and goes down to about 12000. unfortunately the 12700h cannot be undervolted so no performance gain can be had. my main question: is the 2000 point difference in performance worth paying an extra $600? will i notice a big difference in performance between these laptops? im thinking the extra cores on the 9720 will make a big difference in real world use, but if the laptop gets too hot and throttles, maybe the extra cores wont matter because they are running too slowly? has anyone ordered either one of these configurations who can say anything about the battery life? it would seem as this would have a great battery life without the gpu, any experience with this? some further info: i believe power is running through the cord as the led is lit up. i think the computer is not recognizing the power cord but not entirely sure. the computer died because i didn\\'t realize it wasn\\'t charging, so i\\'ll have to fix it from outside. thanks for any help! update: i plugged my phone charger that is also usbc into the computer and it seems to be charging now. dell should send me a new charger and hopefully problem solved. get it here https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=tjkgw fixes & enhancements - reduced the fan noise of the system when the thermal management setting is set to quiet mode. - added enabled authenticated bios interface menu in security in the bios setup menu. i will add a second ssd on my xps 9520, but i want to have another windows installation to separate work and personal stuff. is it possible to have dual boot windows x windows? (all guides i found are setting up dual boot with linux x windows ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjv5-jn-swm&t=922s this is the only hands on review i can find at the moment. i opt for the top spec, core i9, rtx 3060, 4k uhd, 16 gb ram which is immediately upgraded to 64 gb, 1 tb ssd and i added 2 tb samsung 980 pro as main drive. i ordered from local marketplace in indonesia on jan 19th 2022 and delivered feb 12th 2022. it was a pre ordered item. i did clean reinstall windows 11. hi everyone, i was browsing best buy\\'s website looking for a replacement laptop and i saw an open-boxed xps 15 with i7 11th gen processor, 16gb ram, 512 gb storage, and 3050ti for about $1240. this sounds like a decent deal but not sure and would like some opinions about it. for reference, i would be doing data analytics with it at my job as well as practicing backend engineering on the side with it. ideally, i would like this to last me at least 3 years down the road but don\\'t wanna make the purchase if the price isn\\'t worth it. u should post the video\\'s transcript here instead. people go on reddit to read, not watch video. hi, can anyone who with the xps 13 plus oled (or anyone with xps oled display) help me check if this video looks fine on your laptop with hdr on? on the first frame it will be oversaturated and overexposed... https://youtu.be/hrdqhavinee i got two xps 13 plus oled and both of them cannot present the hdr correctly. but some hdr content are looks fine. i also tried forza horizon 4 demo, didn\\'t work on hdr (it was overexposed) either... i did contact dell support but they cannot resolve the issue. \\u200b i use my phone take some photos, \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on \\u200b \\u200b hdr off hdr on what are the questions? yeah i believe so / if you use the battery saver mode it will dim at that point but not on disconnecting the power supply 😔 i recently got an xps 13 plus from my job. i thought it would be great for portability because its very small and light and i have large external monitors at home and in the office. i\\'ve had it for a couple of weeks and it has been great, up until the last day or so. the xps 13 plus has a touch/light bar which allows you to switch between function keys and device settings (e.g. keyboard backlight, volume etc.), and it\\'s started to behave very oddly whenever i open the laptop. whenever the lid is shut, my external usb keyboard takes over and there aren\\'t any issues. but as soon as i go on a teams call or have to use the mic/camera - and open the laptop, it starts acting strange. i have a suspicion that it might be a faulty machine, but also a that it could be a design fault. a lot of laptops have copper heat pipes that run right along the top edge of the chassis, under where the function keys are, and since i\\'ve been using mine with the lid closed i\\'m wondering if its overheated and melted or caused shorts in the function key circuitry. i work as a developer, so some light code compilation is all i\\'m doing really - nothing to stress the machine to the point where it would be melting the internal circuitry. it\\'s difficult to tell, but i haven\\'t seen anyone else talking about this as an issue - but the machine\\'s were only released recently, so maybe this wouldn\\'t have happened to anyone else yet. just posting to see if anyone else has experienced this, or knows of anyone else who has? or am i being stupid and there\\'s some software issue or setting that i should know how to turn off? finally.... a complete solve for the oh too common overheating issue with the xps series! i purchased a 2021 dell xps 17 9710 with the overpowered i9 11th gen processor, rtx 3060 and 16gb ram, which on paper seems like it should be able to handle gaming fairly well. well, i was super bummed (like so many others) to be slowed down by overheating issues. i tried raising the laptop up, which helped a bit, but ultimately i was seeing frame rate drops after 15 minutes of gameplay caused by 100°c cpu temperatures. i was pissed, considering my brother is using a 4 year old msi laptop that games flawlessly. so! the journey began.... i tried disabling intel turbo boost and setting the my dell power settings to \"ultra performance\", which seems to fix some people\\'s problems, but they didn\\'t help mine. then i found a post on some forums about throttlestop. it\\'s a pretty user friendly program considering what you are doing, and it enables you to tune down the amount of power your cpu/gpu can utilize. i followed this guide and then adjusted settings a little once i understood more. i can honestly say now that i haven\\'t seen my computer get hotter than 72°c while gaming no man\\'s sky, deeprock galactic & raft, on ultra settings, and my frame rates stay consistently maxed. finally, i can say with confidence that i love my xps.... no thanks to dell, however. tldr: i used throttlestop to lower the voltage of my cpu/gpu and can now game on high/ultra settings without breaching 72°c (161°f). previously it would crack 100°c in 15 minutes and start lagging, regardless of the graphic settings. i was wondering which screen option is better. is the oled screen noticeably better? also what are we looking at in terms of battery life? is there a major difference? i was also wondering whether it supports pen input. for some context, this is the 9520 with fhd/i7/3050ti. all i\\'ve been using it for recently has been web browsing alone, and the battery life and estimates have been lacklustre, any ideas or tips to help improve it? if you are comfortable with refurbished devices. i would take a look at dell outlet, they have the 9520 discounted by almost $400. which would allow you to upgrade to the i9 for about the same price as the i7. i recently ordered an xps 8950 from dell, but i am wondering about the possibility to upgrade my desktop. it comes with the i9-12700k cpu and 3060ti gpu. certain modifications i\\'m looking to do, are upgrading to a 3080 gpu, as well as upgrading the psu (currently 460w) to a 750w version. though, i am not sure to which extend i am able to carry out these modifications, as dell uses proprietary components within their desktops (like the psu). does anyone have any advice or experience with this? thanks in advance. hi, i am looking to purchase a new xps 13, but i cant find anything about the performance of the i5 model. i just wanted to see if anyone that has a 9320 in the i5 variant could post a cinebench r23 score so i can get a general idea of how fast it is relative to the i7 model. thanks! i recently got an xps 13 plus from my job. i thought it would be great for portability because its very small and light and i have large external monitors at home and in the office. i\\'ve had it for a couple of weeks and it has been great, up until the last day or so. the xps 13 plus has a touch/light bar which allows you to switch between function keys and device settings (e.g. keyboard backlight, volume etc.), and it\\'s started to behave very oddly whenever i open the laptop. whenever the lid is shut, my external usb keyboard takes over and there aren\\'t any issues. but as soon as i go on a teams call or have to use the mic/camera - and open the laptop, it starts acting strange. i have a suspicion that it might be a faulty machine, but also a that it could be a design fault. a lot of laptops have copper heat pipes that run right along the top edge of the chassis, under where the function keys are, and since i\\'ve been using mine with the lid closed i\\'m wondering if its overheated and melted or caused shorts in the function key circuitry. i work as a developer, so some light code compilation is all i\\'m doing really - nothing to stress the machine to the point where it would be melting the internal circuitry. it\\'s difficult to tell, but i haven\\'t seen anyone else talking about this as an issue - but the machine\\'s were only released recently, so maybe this wouldn\\'t have happened to anyone else yet. just posting to see if anyone else has experienced this, or knows of anyone else who has? or am i being stupid and there\\'s some software issue or setting that i should know how to turn off? hi everyone, relatively new owner of a dell xps 9520 x 1 month and i\\'m having significant issues. i am noticing fairly consistent extreme system lag/decreased performance while on battery power. i\\'m talking with dell support but wanted to see if the community had any insights or suggestions, and to see if anyone else has had this problem. issue: after leaving the computer plugged in to its dock overnight, i take the computer to work and use it on battery whereupon i experience such decreased performance that video playback, scrolling through browser windows and pdf\\'s, moving windows around, basically everything is extremely slow. it doesn\\'t seem particularly related to gpu performance. the device severely throttles cpu speed and real time cpu clocks on p cores don\\'t go above 1000-1500 mhz which is far below their base clock (not just failing to turboboost, stuck in underclock). this leads to infuriatingly poor performance. there is no response in changing windows power mode, nor my dell\\'s thermal mode, but by default they are usually on balanced (windows power mode) and optimized (dell thermal mode). after the lag sets in, putting both on max performance will not improve the cpu clocks, so they\\'ll still be stuck < 1500 mhz max. a restart restores normal performance, where p cores are able to turbo appropriately to 4500 mhz or higher. any idea what is going on? i\\'ve reinstalled the os (via the dell os recovery which resinstalls all dell software). it feels like a system firmware issue, recently saw a video by dave2d where they said dell did some aggressive cpu throttling to give decent performance system config: i9-12900hk, 64 gb ram, 3.5k oled, 3050ti. thanks in advance for your input and help just got my dell xps 15 9520 - 12th gen i7-12700h, nvidia geforce rtx 3050 ti 4gb gddr6 [45w], 64gb (2x32gb) ddr5 4800mhz and the 15.6\" fhd+. been running several cinebench tests, and i can\\'t seem to get the multi core score over 10500. multi core single core this is my first xps in 6 years, so i haven\\'t run benchmarks before. but from what i see online from otherwise with the similar specs are scores of 13000+ is there something i\\'m doing wrong? the only software i put on so far is chrome, avast, drive and dropbox. hey, i recently got my first xps, the 9520 without dgpu. i love the design of the laptop and everything (it has been my dream laptop for many years), but i have encountered some issues. most of them come from the fact that i am using linux (fedora) on it, so stuff like the speakers and the battery life are for me to fix/setup and are not the problem of dell. however, what i have a problem with that i am pretty sure is bios-related (so not in my power to change) is the fact that more that half of the times during boot, the fans go to their full speed and then back to zero all within basically a second. sometimes the same happens randomly when i use the laptop normally, with temperatures chilling at 40° and fans being basically off, it ramps up in exactly the same way as it sometimes does on boot, and then it goes back to silent. it has been doing that both when i got the laptop with the 1.2.0 bios, and also now with 1.3.0. i also tried to change the power profile to quiet to see if it\\'d make a difference, but it did exactly the same thing when i booted it again. i would be happy for any advice, or at least to know if someone else also experienced similar issue with their unit. thanks! edit: forgot to ask if this is something likely to be fixed with a future bios update, or whether it is likely to be a problem only with my particular unit. the bios updates all the different modules in the laptop to newer code, so i don\\'t believe the release notes are at all complete. tested with latencymon before and afterwards and i am afraid that the latency of acpi.sys is still 1300+ us, which is not good. at the moment they do seem to happen less often though - which is a pure \"guess\" and the problem with w11 is there are just so many different processes that might run at some point it is impossible to tell. i am rarely experiencing no audio pops/crackles - typically when doing driver updates which i guess i can forgive. a little bit. i have a clean w11 install with a ton of work programs on here. specs: i\\'ve got the fhd+ version with a i7-1260 cpu and 16 gb of ram. power mode: best power efficiency. thermal setting: cool. edit: os: windows 11 home 64-bit screen brightness: average 50% although the thermal setting is set to cool, i find the palm rest gets oddly warm under light web browsing - the fans aren\\'t active and noisy. the heat makes me think that the cpu is overactive. at 93% remaining battery, the estimated remaining battery time is 4½ hours. i\\'ve mostly been using the xps 13 plus for some programming in an ide (intellij) without building and running the programs. i seem to get around 4 - 5.5 hours of battery life under such tasks. \\u200b i find this to be frustratingly low battery life for the fhd+ version and does not at all match up with the 8 - 10 hours i\\'ve heard reviewers are getting. what is your experience with the battery time? i feel like the battery life shouldn\\'t be this bad... after using my laptop docked, then undocking, i at least sometimes have issues: the touchpad is no longer visible to the system, or no input method works (keyboard, touchpad, and touchscreen). in the latter case the device appears to be frozen (and may actually be, i\\'m not sure). i updated my device to windows 11 22h2 (which is still in release preview) before noticing this issue. has anyone else experienced this? any suggestions? anyone have a link to where i could find the linux driver for the webcam for the xps 13 plus 9320? i received my unit last week preinstalled with windows since ubuntu wasn\\'t available in the configuration i wanted. i\\'ve since installed my preferred os of pop!_os which is an ubuntu derivative and everything works great except for the fingerprint sensor and the webcam. i found the fingerprint driver via google search and that\\'s working great now but i have yet to find the webcam driver. unfortunately it looks like i can only download the windows recovery image from dell\\'s support site since that\\'s what my laptop shipped with so i can\\'t even get their ubuntu image to pull the driver out of it. if anyone got the ubuntu version of the xps 13 plus and can share the apt repos/packages that came preinstalled i\\'d greatly appreciate it. even better would just be a direct deb for the webcam driver itself. i pretty much agree. with the oled the battery life is quite short as he says. i bought this machine in august 2021, and out of the box (first week pretty much) i had the issue you see in the photo below (except only the right hand bar of black, not the left) and that would go away when turning off the display (via cmdline, closing & reopening screen or restarting). i never bothered fixing it since it would go away with a simple command and only ever appears once after turning on the laptop from shutdown - plus i needed the laptop for uni. just yesterday *while* i was using the laptop browsing the web, the left-hand bar appeared on the screen spontaneously. i do the display turn off turn on thing, doesn\\'t work. restart the laptop, and there\\'s two bars (right and left) the right bar goes away when doing the same trick but the left is there permanently. the patch is visible regardless of light level - but obviously less so on high brightness as its lit up by the surrounding area. on high brightness the laptop is still usable. i figure its some issue with the backlight / diffuser but whats strange to me is that its only these bars. as i understand it the backlight is one big white light panel so how is it only failing in these areas, and why does one fix itself when turning off and on again? 100% not a software / firmware issue. running ubuntu, windows and the bios has these issues come up. reseated the display connecter to the mobo and the same issue. i don\\'t really want to take the display apart to look at myself. lcd test shows no issues. \\u200b \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/8tsno0j6u0891.jpg?width=2950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d1dbcd0d828b8a2906d0dc942a3e0af4d4b4b36 i ordered on may 25th. was supposed to be delivered on july 13th. delayed - now supposed to be delivered july 16th. delayed - now supposed to be delivered july 20th. delayed - haven’t received yet. horrible experience as the title says does anyone know if the xps15 9520 will fit in the dell ecoloop leather case? specifically pe1522vl - supposed to be for the latitude 9520 but i am not sure of any differences. i watched the linus tech tips review of this laptop and my opinion on it is changing now i realise the specs are literally the best in the firm factor for my needs (numerics and coding). the thing is i can’t find many actual hands in reviews from consumers. people with this machine, what is your experience like? i really want a high performance machine i bought this laptop six months ago, and i\\'ve been shocked to see the battery slowly deteriorating in the battery report over that time. the setting within dell power manager was set to adaptive the entire time instead of the plugged in setting, but i thought it would get used to this behaviour to use the battery efficiency. currently, i use my laptop almost exclusively while plugged in (i\\'ve heard it\\'s better for battery longevity than wasting cycles unplugged). i\\'m not sure what\\'s happening, but i\\'m a little concerned that the way my laptop is going, i might only have half the battery by, say, next year. additionally, i almost always use the better battery setting. is this typica? due to my dell premium insurance, i\\'m considering contacting them to resolve this (expires next year). \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/knq32z6jey791.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=86683167ea3ae1a984bed55a07fea3fb4c5f9b59 just got a 9520 with the i7 and i have an issue that has shown up a couple times here with older generations, but nothing in fixes it. youtube 4k and locally stored 4k h.265 video lags significantly, with tons of dropped frames. i noticed that task manager shows the \"video decode\" and \"video processing\" taking nearly 100% on the iris xe (my wife\\'s yoga 9 with a u-series i7 and iris xe shows only <20% usage). i also noticed in hwinfo (separate app for looking at hardware stats) that when this occurs, the igpu seems to get stuck at 99mhz. when it doesn\\'t happen, the igpu scales between 100mhz and 800mhz. all the latest drivers are installed. reinstall of the intel xe driver (incidentally, the driver file on dell\\'s website says \"uhd\" but it shows up in device manager as xe) appears to fix the system temporarily - it works for a while but then goes back to stuttering (with the same stuck at 100mhz and the task manager showing video decode and video processing near 100%). killer wifi priorization disabled, then uninstalled. feels like a software issue, but one that has persisted over multiple generations? my dell (and in bios) is set to ultra performance, and windows power is set to performance configuration:- i7-12700h- performance mode (windows) and ultra performance (my dell)- 3050ti (maybe something is broken in how this is connected to the iris xe?)- 32gb ram- 500gb hard drive- i also use a tb4 dock, but either way (standlone or connected) i run into issues update (unfortunately not yet fixed) below: (2) xps 9520 with laggy 4k video : dellxps (reddit.com) more trouble shooting charts of clocks, utilization, etc: (7) xps 9520 with laggy 4k video : dellxps (reddit.com) for those that are following this thread, unfortunately it seems like the problem has resurfaced after being stable for 24 hrs after applying the fix i posted about here: (8) xps 9520 with laggy 4k video : dellxps (reddit.com), although this time a reboot fixes the problem (before the issue would persist even after a reboot). 7/1/2022 update: unfortunately a clean install did not help. i even did a reintall of the bios, and used a clean version of windows 11 (e.g. the one from microsoft and without the dell/mcafee bloat). after a little over 24 hrs, the stuttering in video and in the interface came back. as hail mary, i\\'ve installed the dell power manager rather than my dell to see if that perhaps fixes my problem. i\\'m also going to run on the optimized thermal profile rather than ultra performance - i noticed that cinebench scores are higher under optimized, maybe ultra performance is broken on my machine. 7/3/2022 update: that latest step of using dell power manager rather than my dell seems to work. i installed it from the microsoft app store, and it installed some separate drivers upon launch. i also installed a \"microchip\" driver that showed up under windows update/advanced options/optional updates tab. so far 48 hrs and no problems - it works under optimized and ultra performance (although i don\\'t really see a difference between the two, cinemench is in the 12k range for each and 3dmark time spy in the 5200 range). am a bit concerned that since the dell power manager app is being phased out for my dell, i will have a problem in the future (although my computer now does not allow me to download my dell, probably because this is a fresh windows install and not from a dell image) i received my xps 9320 yesterday and it seemed to be running fine at least at first glance. then this morning i try watching some youtube/twitch videos and within a few minutes everything would seem to get sluggish. not just within chrome. i\\'ve since tried multiple troubleshooting steps to include reinstalling windows 11 twice with factory settings. i just ran the online diagnostic on dell\\'s site which i believe uses support assist and it is claiming the video card failed and basically had me go through submitting a support request to have it replaced. my question is would this explain why i have the issues i am seeing? thanks in advance. https://imgur.com/a/ygm4nks i received my laptop yesterday and wanted to share my experience with my already owned cable matters 4k tripple display usb c hub. i bought it previously to use with my dell work laptop. i wanted something cheaper than the $300 docks out there. for my work laptop (latitude 5510 thunderbolt 3) i\\'m able to run my dual monitor setup: 5120x1440p monitor at 60hz and my 2560x1080p monitor at 75hz (max it goes). also, the precision\\'s charger wouldn\\'t charge the laptop through the hub. i had to buy a 3rd party brick. displayport to the higher resolution monitor and hdmi to the smaller one for what it\\'s worth. i\\'m happy to report that with the 9320, i can run my 5120x1440p monitor at 120hz and the 2560x1080p at 75hz. this is most likely due to having tb4. also, the 9320 charger that came with the laptop is able to charge through the hub as well. my monitors resolutions are close\\'ish to a 4k and 1440p setup, so there\\'s a chance it would work well for that. i don\\'t have those sized monitors to test though. hopefully this helps someone save some money by not having to buy a much more expensive dock, assuming you dont need the extra features they offer. a lot of my research originally came from dan s. charlton – tech blog (wordpress.com) , so there\\'s the credit to him. amazon.com: cable matters 4k triple display usb c hub with 2x displayport, 1x hdmi, and 100w charging for windows - displayport 1.4 and dsc 1.2 enabled for triple 4k 60hz display - not compatible with mac : electronics \\u200b edit: i\\'m willing to answer any other questions about the laptop if you have them. there\\'s other threads in the sub already, but just throwing it out there. i have the i5 16gb 500gb 1200p(non-touch) model. i\\'m configuring my potential dell xps 17 9720 purchase, and noticed that the factory oem ram supposedly has ddr5-4800 30-29-29-57 timings. that\\'s extremely good for ddr5. for context, if money was no object, ddr5-4800 34-34-34-76 are the fastest timings available on newegg.com . the dell oem ram is significantly faster than that. it\\'s so fast that i suspect it could even be a typo. can someone with a dell xps 17 9720 confirm that the ram timings are indeed 30-29-29-57? (you can check using cpu-z.) i\\'m the type of cheap-ass who orders their laptop with the smallest amount of memory possible, then buy the ram from somewhere else and upgrade it myself. but in this particular case i would gladly fork over $300 for ultra-premium ram. liars @dell hi, i did. i repasted with conductonaut (yes i was very careful and did this many times before. on my 9560 it lasted for 5 years without any problems.). i covered the surrounding with kapton tape and put foam round gpu and cpu. i need a new laptop and my choices are: xps 13 plus (no jack and poor battery life as well as no function row); this monstrosity in either blue or bronze??? or a dated model with a quad core. \\u200b who is making these design decisions? hey, i just got a loaded xps 15 9520 ( i9-12900hk, 64gb ddr5) and like most other people from what i have found, i am confused on what usb ssd i should get for maximum speed. the usb spec and names has me confused since dell doesn\\'t say more than \"usb 3.2 gen 2x2\" and \"thunderbolt 4\", but all the specs online show multiple possibilities for max speeds. has anyone seen more detailed specs? i\\'m looking for something that is going to let me off-load large pictures from my system to the ssd as fast as possible. any and all help is appreciated. yesterday when i was looking at the configuration options for the new xps 13 plus, i had the choice of the i5 1240p, i7 1260p and i7 1280p - now there is no i7 1280p. i could also choose to have ubuntu installed instead of windows - that is no longer an option either. additionally, the colour choice of platinum or graphite is now just platinum. why have they omitted options - why not just grey it out and say \"out of stock\" if it is out of stock? how am i supposed to have any clue when it might come back in stock? hello tech fam, new to this group. my girlfriend replaced her broken hp pavilion gaming laptop with an xps i7-1075 with the 1660 and i’ve borrowed it a couple of times enough to fall in love with the hardware. so i’ve ordered my own xps 17 from the current stable and it arrives tomorrow i7 12th gen 32gb 1tb 3060 card 4k touch it gets to my friend’s shop tomorrow morning and i plan to do some surgery and swap up to my two 2tb pm9a1s and to a 64 gb ram kit. understandably this is going to involve a guitar pick with what everyone is saying is a painful opening process. do you guys have any tips on which part of the cover to start from and how to do this as safely as possible? thanks as the title says. i just received my 9520 about 2 days ago and didn\\'t really notice until today. when i close my lid, my screen doesn\\'t turn off and my laptop doesn\\'t go to sleep. i have the oled panel and this concerns me and worries me about burn-ins. sleep isn\\'t working when the lid closes. everything is update in regard to drivers and stuff. i changed the lid settings to hibernate as well and it doesn\\'t work. it\\'s like the lid closing does nothing. any solutions? i purchased this machine primarily for digital art and now that i\\'ve got it all set up i\\'m seeing a quite significant lag when painting the brush lags behind the cursor movement and then follows....much greater lag than on my old dell xps-15 9550 i7 using a wacom intuos pth 660 medium anyone else seeing this? as far as i can tell, only in the us and in uk its available for now. edit: my bad, should have precised i\\'m looking to buy in dubai (uae), can\\'t seem to find anything that shows its available there dear all, would appreciate your help a lot. i just received my new dell xps 17 9720 ( 4k, rtx 3060, i7 ) and all seemed great until after trying some shortcuts on windows 11, fans started spinning very often without any load on the system, and the windows cursor is blinking with the loading circle all the time ( even after a restart ). i also couldn\\'t use a search bar and the battery life was 3h on average. i did reinstall windows with dell factory image, and it solved the fans issue, cursor and search bar issue ( battery life still sometimes would show 6 hours left sometimes 2 ). but after a few days, i install zoom app, and it started all over again, can\\'t use the search bar, and fans are spinning right away after i turn on the system etc. i have no idea what is going on. i have read that it might be a problem with dell preinstalled soft, and clean windows install might help. does anybody face the same issues, and could it be that smth wrong with the hardware and i need to ask them to replace the laptop? thanks a lot! hey all, keeping it brief today as i\\'m super busy at the moment with work, but copy/pasting (mostly) from a quick twitter thread i posted earlier ;-) : i opted for i5-1240p 16 gb ram fhd+ touch 512 gb (samsung pm9a1) nvme ssd 1st impressions: keyboard is phenomenal touchpad is very good/feels normal stunning aesthetics very fast cpu/storage perf. runs quite warm unless you switch to cool profile battery life seems fine so far (~7 hrs)... auto brightness is on, mostly near the top half (or max setting) during use! cheap fhd+ screen is great front edge really is kinda sharp audio/speakers are some of the best in class capacitive fn row is fine, suboptimal ventilation design is super neat; seems to intake via speaker grilles + kb margins zero fingerprints the gorilla glass palmrest = super comfy the keyboard backlighting is uneven and, on the lighter-colored case, blends in with the key color, making it impossible to see the labels someone complained about the keys being flush with the palmrest. actually this isn\\'t new as most kbs have a sunken surround. i am using the laptop on cool mode, and it never gets hot & runs perfectly fast this way the backspace key has ever so slightly less feedback on my unit which took a bit to adjust to. that, plus the tiny up/down arrow keys, are my only complaints about the physical keys. still, the keyboard is just incredibly good overall i don\\'t think i\\'ve heard the fans once unlike my xps 13 7390, the screen does not disappear when viewed through polarized sunglasses screen is easily visible in bright environments despite glossy finish it\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s really, really good. zero regrets so far! hope this helps someone! i had ordered one on 28th may and it has been delayed 4 times now. haven’t received it yet. hi, i\\'ve got the xps 9520 with i7 and uhd screen a week ago, i\\'ve noticed that when the laptop is in ac the keyboard is warm (even at idle state)....it really doesn\\'t feel comfortable for typing, i\\'m coming from an xps 9550 which doesn\\'t have that problem. this is happening in windows 11 and manjaro. is this something normal or i got a bad unit? should i return it?? hello, first and foremost i thoroughly enjoy my xps it does everything i need it to for the most part. however, recently there has been noticeable network lags/pauses very briefly. i know it is the laptop and not my isp because i have 8 other devices and they all work flawlessly. anyone able to share a strong argument to send off to dell regarding this? i really don\\'t want to bang my head against a wall arguing with dell with them saying that it\\'s the isp\\'s/routers fault. it\\'s still under the first years warranty however. i am not sure how dell would go through this process but i don\\'t expect it to be an easy one. secondly, my touchpad keeps getting stuck and i need to kinda bend the unit a bit for it to release itself. should be easy enough fix. thirdly, there\\'s a stripped screw at the bottom of the unit when i tried to clean the fans. the screw grooves basically stripped away on the first rotation, the rest of the screws i had 0 issue with. anyways, primarily looking for help on steering me the right way on making a complaint on the networking and not having to argue with them about whether it\\'s the isp or the network adapter. thanks for reading! i got the xps 9520 a week ago. the battery health was at 98% in the first use, after testing battery duration for two cycles, from 100% to 0%, the battery health has dropped to 95%. is this something normal? or did i get a faulty battery? i have an xps 15 9510 which, when i bought it, ran pretty hot. being a software engineer, i push this machine pretty hard. i\\'ve performed all of the following and achieved some pretty low temps. my idle temps now sit around 33 degrees in a 21 degree room. under load whilst working i still hit 100 degrees if i enable turbo, but it recovers very quickly. fresh install of windows 11 undervolted using throttlestop to -80mv reapplied thermal paste with arctic mx-4 purchased a cooling pad i\\'ve heard of people applying thermal pads to the mosfets, but i can\\'t find anything about it being done on this model, only older ones. could someone point me in the right direction for this please? what measures have you taken to improve the thermal performance of your xps? hello everyone. i have had my xps 9510 for a few months now. i\\'ve really enjoyed using it and haven\\'t had any significant problems. my desktop is slowing down, so i want to transition to using the xps entirely. has anyone found a docking station/hub that works particularly well for the xps 15? i do not think i\\'ll be doing anything incredibly unique, but i would like one that could support 2 monitors. there are just so many options on amazon and almost all have conflicting reviews. i figured it would be best to ask with this laptop specifically. additionally, has anyone encountered when external monitors flash on/off briefly when using a station? this has happened at work when i plug in, and i read that it could be something to do with drivers that need updated. it hasn\\'t been a significant issue though. \\u200b thank you for the help! i got a reconditioned 9710 but am unsure what battery is in it? any way to tell without opening it? i just ordered the new xps 9315 (not to be mistaken with the xps plus 9320). there are no reviews, nor posts here on reddit about it. only a few about the plus one. i chose the more traditional 9315 instead of the plus (9320) as i really don\\'t like the capacitor keys, plus battery life based on what i read should (and some reviewers confirmed) is crap with that little battery size plus powerful processors. as soon as i receive it, i will be doing a review in this post. but if somebody already received it, i would love to hear about it. i order i5, 16gb ram, touch fhd. i know its battery is also small on this one, hoped that with less powerful cpu will last more. also i am planning to use it with chrome os as i usually do with all my devices. title. i’m going to be using this computer as a college student (finance) so am unsure what processor, memory, or hard drive is best. this is going to be my main laptop for years so i want to get something that i won’t have to upgrade from soon. thanks for all the help! i have a brand new 9520 and it makes sounds like there is an old spinning hdd inside, usually happens whenever the system is under load but before any fans need to turn on. hello beautiful people! i\\'ve noticed several threads with people struggling to clean-install windows 11 properly and easily. here\\'s a best-effort guide to all steps i have taken to get a bloat-free and compromise-free windows 11 experience. note: i have an xps 15 9520 (and an older 9500). the guide is written for the 9520 but should apply to the xps 17 9700/9710/9720 and perhaps even the xps 13 (9300/9310/9320). \\u200b phase 1: preparations you\\'ll need at least an 8gb usb drive, and a usb-a to usb-c adapter (if your usb drive is not type c). \\u200b download the windows 11 media creation tool: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295 plug in your usb drive run the windows 11 media creation tool follow the instructions, select your usb drive and let it do its thing. note: i would recommend getting all updates. download the intel rst driver (vmd): intel® rapid storage technology driver installation software with intel® optane™ memory (10th and 11th gen platforms) put it in a folder at the root of the usb drive. we\\'ll need this later. download the ax211 drivers and extract them to the root of your usb drive: https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/n3ciw08w.exe note: i used the ax211 wireless lan drivers from the lenovo site because it\\'s got an easy \"extract only\" option when you run it. it shouldn\\'t matter as we can overwrite this with the dell/intel drivers later. copy your c:/windows/system21/oem folder to a separate folder on your usb drive \\u200b phase 2: installation \\u200b reboot the laptop press f12 as it boots up to get to the one-time boot menu select the usb drive to start the installation note: if you\\'re facing issues booting from the usb drive, check your boot order settings. you should not need to change anything in order to get it working if you\\'re using the default settings. restore defaults if in doubt. once booted from the usb drive, the windows 11 installation wizard will start. first, you need to set the language, time, and keyboard. once done, click on the ‘next’ button. on the next page, click on the ‘install now’ option. when selecting the type of installation, click custom to clean the disk and install an absolutely fresh copy of windows 11. now, if you\\'re using a stock laptop, it\\'s set to raid mode by default, and the raid drivers are not a part of the standard windows 11 installation package. that\\'s why we downloaded the irst drivers earlier. click on \\'load drivers\\' browse to the folder where your irst drivers were added. you need to select the intel rst vmd controller 9a08 (tgl) driver and press \\'next\\' to install it. your drives should have instantly appeared. i would recommend formatting only the large os partition and leaving the recovery partition alone in case we ever want to easily go back to the stock os without using the dell recovery iso download tool. proceed with the installation. restart the computer. go through the basic setup, and when you get to the stage where you need to select a wifi network, you may not be seeing any networks. this is because the ax211 wifi driver may not be a part of your installation media package. press shift + f10 to open the setup diagnostic command prompt type wmic logicaldisk get deviceid, volumename, description to get the drive letter for your usb drive. type pnputil /install x:\\\\*.inf /install (replace x with your usb\\'s drive letter). this will add and install all the drivers in the root of your usb drive (the wifi drivers). the wifi networks should appear now. \\u200b phase 3: debloating (optional, but recommended) i followed and would recommend this guide for debloating: github - theworldofpc/windows11-debloat-privacy-guide i used the debloat everything except microsoft store & xbox option. because i want this functionality and because without the microsoft store, several key features of the laptop may not work as intended (such as dobly vision, hevc videos, dell power manager, dell premiercolor, etc.) you can also go through the guide and manually debloat what you want to instead of using the script. \\u200b phase 4: getting essential dell drivers and apps now that we have an absolutely clean version of windows, let\\'s start adding a little bit of the xps personality back into the os. enabling dell-only oem apps to be downloaded from the microsoft store: run these two commands in an admin command prompt: reg add \"hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\currentversion\\\\store\" /v oemid /f /t reg_sz /d dell reg add \"hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\currentversion\\\\store\" /v storecontentmodifier /f /t reg_sz /d dell_xps restart your pc (this is important) run the command in an admin cmd to reset the store: wsreset adding oem-specific information to windows and dell logo to boot screen: remember the oem folder you copied in phase 1? paste it back into c:/windows/system32/ restart the system install the following drivers from dell\\'s support site for your particular model: intel chipset drivers intel chipset device software driver intel management engine components installer intel serial io driver intel hid event filter driver intel thunderbolt controller driver intel dynamic tuning driver intel integrated sensor solution driver graphics drivers intel nvidia audio drivers media card reader driver fingerprint sensor driver install the following apps from the microsoft store: my dell (optional, for the power/thermal settings and quick access to device data) -

recommended if you didn\\'t get my dell): https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9pd11rq8qc9k that\\'s it! congratulations, you\\'re now running a fresh, clean copy of windows 11 that you\\'re certain is set up just the way you want it to: with maximum security, performance, and, best of all, no compromises! feel free to ask any questions, provide any suggestions, and let me know if i\\'ve done anything incorrectly. i\\'ll try to keep this thread updated with the best feedback! best! jabberwocky i really struggled to find any significant reviews on this device on windows, let alone on linux. i took a risk ordering it, and i\\'m going to be using it over the next few days and updating this review with more information. i\\'m going to focus mostly on things that are objective and not subjective (e.g. no excessive commentary on whether the capacitive touch bar is good or bad). for reference, i have owned: 2021 asus rog zephyrus g14 2018 macbook pro 13 starlabs labtop mk iv thinkpad p15 and various other, older laptops. i\\'ve used linux on all of them except the macbook pro. i honestly can\\'t compare any functionality to windows as i don\\'t use it and haven\\'t booted windows is many years. specs i ordered the 1200p touch, i7-1260p, 32gb ram and 1tb hdd. i ordered the developer edition, so it came with ubuntu. i briefly checked functionality on that before replacing it with arch. note: on arch everything works except the webcam. (and possibly the fingerprint reader, untested on any platform). on ubuntu, the webcam did work and seemed pretty decent. most of the reviews were complaining about it, but it seemed fully acceptable to me. as the webcam doesn\\'t work on arch i can\\'t do any further testing related to it at the moment. ** update day... 6? **i noticed for the first time today that the integrated microphone array in the webcam also doesn\\'t work. this makes sense. its more annoying than the webcam not working, though. it\\'ll likely motivate me to get the driver kernel modules compiled. screen it\\'s great. on par with my macbook. my untrained eyes can\\'t see a difference. i don\\'t have any objective measuring tools, but it definitely seems to be 500 nits as rated based on comparisons with the 350 nit g14. at around 50% brightness, its very usable in a brightly lit room. i am a software developer and i find the resolution to be perfect. 16:10 is superior for the trade and the text is crisp at this screen size. contrast is really good -- much better than any laptop i\\'ve used aside from the macbook (and not noticeably worse than that). on ubuntu, auto screen brightness worked. i haven\\'t gotten it working yet on arch, but will update when/if i do. i rarely use the touch feature, but it works. ** update from day 8 ** i got auto brightness working. i thought (incorrectly) that the brightness sensor may be part of the camera array, and thus i couldn\\'t get it working without the webcam bus drivers in the kernel. anyway, i installed autolight from the aur and then changed `/etc/autolight/config` to point to `alp_device=/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1/in_illuminance_raw` instead of the default (device:0) and it works fine. keyboard it did take some getting used to, but now that i am used to it, it is fast. it has a distinct click but it is not overly loud, just tactile. after about 4 hours i am now perfectly comfortable on it. my only complaint is the tiny up/down arrows. i would have preferred a smaller right shift key and slightly smaller left/right arrows. i bought the platinum/white version. the backlight is... annoying. in good lighting, it reduces the visibility of the key caps, not increases. the backlight isn\\'t overly bright, which is good in the dark but if you just like having a backlit keyboard even during the day, this doesn\\'t get bright enough and the keycaps become poorly visible when the backlight is on. this is similar to the g14 experience (also white). brief note on the touch bar -- i was never overly bothered by the mac touch bar. if you were, this will likely bother you. it\\'s basically the same. it would have helped if they\\'d just added small ribs between the touch keys for tactile placement, but there\\'s no distinction between one \"key\" to the next. i use emacs and not vim so i don\\'t rely overly on escape. the delete key is large enough that its very difficult to miss. i use the function row a lot and that\\'s what my fingers miss more than anything. ** update from day 2 ** the touch bar is getting a little annoying. i don\\'t miss keys often -- its more annoying because the \"keys\" are so large and a soft touch triggers them. so, if i have my finger resting near the tilde/grave key, i might hit escape by accident -- just a touch and it triggers. not the end of the world, but it is annoying when it happens. touchpad the touchpad is perfectly fine. i personally haven\\'t had any issues using it. on ubuntu for whatever reason, two-finger click didn\\'t work. i don\\'t use ubuntu, so that might be normal. on arch/gnome, all gestures and multi finger clicks work as expected. the haptics feel great. i don\\'t notice that the pad doesn\\'t actually click. ** update from day 3 **there are some annoyances with the touch pad not physically clicking -- mostly when i need to click, hold and drag. since there is no actual depression, it is not super intuitive to know how hard to keep pressing while dragging. this can be fixed by enabling alternative touch pad schemes (e.g. tap to click), but it is a compromise and will take getting used to. i don\\'t really click and drag all that often but you might have different requirements. battery this is what i couldn\\'t find much good data on. some reviews said that the 12th gen power consumption was terrible, others said it was better. i\\'m coming from a ryzen 5000 laptop (the g14). i have tlp installed and haven\\'t done anything else special. it\\'s okay. a little worse than i would like, but not bad. i tried a few different scenarios for an hour or two each: \"office\" communication -- email, slack, jira/confluence, web browsing. in an hour, i had 89% battery, so i would expect around 9-10 hours of this. electron apps aren\\'t extremely efficient, so if you use native apps, it might perform slightly better. development. this was in emacs, with lsp and gopls (golang), as well as intelliphense (php). also still involved slack, web, etc. brief compilation, lots of git operations. this had me at 90% after 48 minutes, so i would expect around 7-8 hours of this. heavy docker work. starting and stopping many containers several times (40-60 containers, 5-6 times) in addition to some development work. this had me down to 79% in 1 hour and 20 minutes. the docker spikes would really drain battery -- disabling turbo boost helped. sixish hours of this expected. all core heavy load. i didn\\'t do this for long, but i would expect around 1 hour max from this. disabling turbo on battery is strongly recommended unless you\\'re near an outlet. overall, compared to my g14, it gets slightly longer battery life. maybe 15% more. a little underwhelming, considering the g14 is a gaming laptop with a higher power/tdp cpu (rated, anyway). it definitely gets better battery life on the lighter loads. i would basically never see my g14 exceed 7 hours of any real use, but i think in office tasks, especially if minimal web browsing was involved, the xps would last 9-10. most of the duration, screen brightness was roughly 50%, which is sufficient for indoor, brightly lit but no direct sunlight. estimates are from 100% to 0%. **update from day 2** battery life continues to be about what i mentioned above. however, i think my development estimate was a little low -- i\\'m getting about 8-8.5 hours of battery life today. i\\'ve been light on actual development due to need to do research and running into some issues. hopefully tomorrow i\\'ll have some heavier development with more frequent compilation and more intense ide interactions. of note, this entire time my applications test environment has been running (43 docker containers). its mostly idle, but not completely, so that\\'s adding some additional battery drain). overall, for days when compilation of code is light, or for more dynamic languages with no formal compilation step, 8 hours seems a reasonable expectation so far for battery life. ** update from day 3 ** different power managers (e.g. tlp versus power-profiles-daemon) seem to make no significant difference. balanced vs power saver makes a slight difference, maybe 30-60 minutes on a full battery. i\\'ll be attempting to fine tune this over time to see what can get the best results with the least detriment to performance. ** update from day 8 ** after resuming from sleep, twice now, the upower service has completely stopped polling the battery consumption. this causes the battery percentage to never change and it also (seems to) cause the battery life to be a bit worse. hopefully its fixed in a future update soon because its rather annoying. in other news, for reasons i can\\'t track down, sometimes i get 8-8.5 hours while developing and others i\\'m lucky to get 7, more like 6.5. i don\\'t have anything obviously different running, but something is obviously making a large difference. i\\'m going to try to isolate it. performance 12 cores is very nice for my workload, which is docker heavy and high thread count matters, just like in sheets. its still early (i\\'ll update this post periodically over the next week or so) but it seems to perform about as well as my g14 despite being on a lower tdp (but who knows if that\\'s really true, intel\\'s tdp is all over the place). if you want a particular benchmark, i can run it, lmk. (as long as its free). i can compile anything that is relatively straightforward (go, rust, javascript/node). ** update from day 4 ** still happy with the performance. i haven\\'t noticed anything where i thought \"wow, this is definitely slower than my previous laptop (g14).\" the exception is of course gaming. i tried a game today -- planet zoo. this ran at 800p and mostly low settings at 50-60 fps. it didn\\'t look fantastic but it was playable. screen tearing was present, even with vsync enabled (this might be fixable by setting the monitor to 30 fps to lower the fps limit). its not a gaming laptop so this is understandable, but casual games like that are fully playable (planet zoo is a fairly demanding \"casual\" game, too). if anyone has any other questions, feel free to ask! i\\'ll do my best to answer. as the title says i\\'m a new owner (it is still in its shipping package waiting in my office for an unboxing tomorrow) of this model : i7-1280p - 32gb ram - 512gb storage - oled screen \\u200b i plan to install ubuntu as soon as possible (but may stick to windows 11 for now, as i think that the linux drivers aren\\'t available yet). as i know a lot of people have questions (heat / bios / screen / fans / etc...), i can try to answer it and edit my post to share it. \\u200b let\\'s begin ! \\u200b when did place your order and when did you receive it? i\\'m in france, the order was placed on may 31th. i received it june 22thi have to say this is a replacement of my defective 9310 (ips screen issues). how is it using the touchpad without any indicators? is it comfortable / easy?it\\'s really easy and the feeling is really good. i never experienced a touchpad with haptic feedbak and i find it really good. for now i never reach the touchpad border to say \"damn where is it ending ?!\" haha how about the keyboard w/o any gaps as well as the capacitive touch row? i find the keyboard very good, it took me some minutes to get used to it. i\\'m right now typing this message with my 9310... and i find the keyboard less smooth. a really good surprise for me as i feared i would make typos all the time ! how\\'s the oled screen? under bright conditions, does the display panel reflect light in a spectrum-y way? how are the viewing angles? is the quality as good as something you\\'d find on a phone? i fond the oled screen absolutly stunning !! damn i bever had an laptop with oled screen, this is really beautiful. i mostly use it in my office and the brightness is around 40% which is good. didn\\'t test it outside but for sure the illimited contrast helps the 400nits brightness. viewing angles are very wide. i can say it is equivalent to what i have on my amoled phone screen. battery life / heat / fan noise ? i tested few different setups : cool mode / balanced mode / performance... i end up using balanced mode in bios (by default) which is really great. i heard the fans only 1 time : during a 3d render which took 5min. battery life isn\\'t really good, i knew it, but it\\'s fine for my use : 4/5hrs with mixed tasks. i just installed tlp so i\\'ll be able to tell if there is some difference. title. i’m going to be using this computer as a college student (finance) so am unsure what processor, memory, or hard drive is best. this is going to be my main laptop for years so i want to get something that i won’t have to upgrade from soon. thanks for all the help! the official product pictures show more of a metallic hue but they\\'re just renders made to look good. what i\\'ve seen on the few hands on videos it looks \\'off white\\' and not metallic at all. how are you finding it? i can\\'t find the xps 13 plus for sale anywhere but dell.com. anyone have any leads on other retailers who have it available, or when it might go for sale at other retailers? it\\'s been a while since launch! hello, last year i had a 9510 but unfortunately had to return it because i, couldn\\'t get the laptop to sleep. i was wondering if this issue has been fixed with the updates versions with the new 12th gen. thanks! hey folks, about two weeks ago i finally recieved my new xps 9520, which is working great so far, aside from some severe issues with bluetooth and i just can\\'t figure it out. it\\'s got the ax211 killer device. no matter which bluetooth device i pair and how many - it just\\'s just a complete mess. mouse (mx master 2s) works great most of the time, but stutters randomly when browsing the web and doing normal work stuff. keyboard (keychron k3) working good most of the time, but once in a while it just goes straight to hell. laggy input af, repeating characters, completely losing connection every other minute, ... you name it. unusable. tried my headset, too (steelseries arctis pro wireless), and it just freezes my laptop completely as long as it\\'s paired, the whole machine gets stuttery as heck. most of the time all my stuff is working great, but then randomly everything just stops working as described above. mouse working great, but laggy keyboard - same but the other way around - or both - or everything\\'s fine. rinse and repeat randomly. found out that the issues seem to come when i have some \"load\" on my wifi connection, not completely sure about that tho. i tried every fix i found on the internet. installed the newest drivers from intel (both for the bluetooth and the wifi part of the module), did the registry fix, deactivated the sleep feature in device manager for the bluetooth device, set the notebook in \"high performance\" state - everything. also, all my bluetooth devices work completely fine and without any issues at all, when paired to other decives. same when i use my sh*tty old laptop - never had any issues with that. i also never had any issues with my wifi on the xps. it\\'s only the bluetooth acting up all the time. i\\'m connected to wifi with 5ghz and with a good connection. the notebook sits about 70-80cm to my left on the desk. i\\'m literally so frustrated i went back to connecting everything via usb and with a dongle for my mouse. whenever i use bluetooth on the xps, the whole thing just gets unusable. also, it\\'s a work laptop, so i can\\'t just send it to dell or something. anyone having similar issues? is this behavior normal on the new 9520? maybe a future bios update will help? is the signal just weak? do i need to make a sacrifice to the bluetooth gods? aside from this, the xps behaves completely normal and fine. hi guys, \\u200b i\\'m running win 11 on my xps 15 9510.. i have an app that runs on startup named: wavemaxx and it takes like 500mb of ram.. i came from linux where the sound was very shit and on win it is pretty good! i thought it was bc of wavemaxx however i played a song and while i played it i killed the wavemaxx tasks and app through taskmanager and nothing changed in regards to the sound. also not for my headphones as some people say the app helps even headphone audio. is it safe to just uninstall the wavemaxx app? what is your experience with this? i really don\\'t want to keep an app running that takes 500mb of ram and does nothing xd early reviews and benchmarks showed that the 3050ti in the dell actually performed worse in games than the 1650ti in the previous version. https://www.google.com/search?q=xps+3050ti+vs+1650+ti&oq=xps+3050ti&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i10j0i10i22i30l2.3032j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=utf-8 did dell ever address this or is the 3050ti still bunk? in case anyone is interested: i was curious to what extent the direct output mode affects gaming performance so i tested it. specs: xps 17 9710 / i7-11800h / rtx 3060 / 4tb / 64gb / fhd / 2x 1440p results: 3dmark timespy 3dmark port royal direct output disabled 7293 4137 direct output enabled 7378 4159 the difference in performance seems negligible. hello, i recently purchased an xps 15 9520. i’m very happy with it but i am planning on installing a second ssd and doing a clean install of windows. i’m good with the ssd install. i am wondering if there is anything special i need to do for the windows install? any particular software i need for the system to work optimally. i have downloaded the win11 media creation tool and made a bootable usb. my thoughts are so the install, download required drivers from dell? and enjoy. is it that simple? thanks been setting up my new 9720 this week and since doing a fresh install of w11 after swapping out the os drive from the included hynix pc801 512gb to a samsung 980 pro 1tb i\\'m experiencing slow boot times and below average read speeds on the ssd. crystal disk mark is returning sub 5,000 mb/s read performance when i can get around 7,000 mb/s on my other pc, and the boot to os is taking well over a minute which seems wrong to me. samsung magician reports all is well with the ssd and it\\'s recognised as a gen 4 ssd. worth noting is that i didn\\'t use the dell iso to reinstall w11 on the new ssd, just changed the storage mode from the default raid to ahci to use standard win11 installer from a usb. could a manual win11 install over the dell iso/image for the 9720 be causing these performance issues? i\\'m wondering if dell\\'s proprietary drivers for 9720 chipset are preferred over generic win11 drivers -- the machine seemed snappier before the os reinstall, with the hynix ssd achieving a blazing 7,200 mb/s and boot time much better. any xps owners had a similar experience? has anyone experienced using linux distros? just wondering how the battery life stacks up to windows counterpart. is it worth it to try one myself? i got myself a zorin os earlier and haven\\'t tried yet with my new xps 9320. i’m currently using a surface laptop 3, and i can say that the device turned into a barely functioning potato after 2 years of use. battery lasts 2 hours. lag and freezes happen when just using the browser. it’s a torturous user experience. i’m currently thinking about upgrading to either the new m2 mba or the new xps 13 plus. i never used products in the xps line, but not using macos and arm artchitecture would be my best preference. my main concern is the battery life and longevity of the xps line. how do the xps 13 laptops perform after 2-3 years of use? what is the starting battery life? what is the battery life several years after the purchase? i have an xps 9510 11800h rtx3050 and after the latest windows update, the headphone audio when directly plugged into the headphone jack began to sound like i was literally listening with tin cans. it didn\\'t *seem* to be related to maxxaudio, as it was off, and then turning it on and off didn\\'t fix it. what finally fixed it was going into headphone properties, turning enhance audio on, then off. i\\'m curious if others had this same issue. okay so i\\'m planning on replacing my dell xps 13 9360 (512gb with 16gb ram) with the new xps 13 plus. i mainly use programming languages such as pytthon,c++,matlab and simulink in my work flow as well as the whole office suite. i\\'m wondering if the new xps laptops are still good money for value or am i better looking at a cheaper laptop with the same spec like the inspiron range or looking at the xps15? since the price difference between the 13 and 15 is not that much. i don\\'t mind the price though i want to know if upgrading to the 15\" xps is a better option cause you get a larger screen and a bit more cpu horsepower as well as some decent graphics. i started with a caldigit ts3 plus ($300 dock) and the beginning few days it worked perfectly. when in clamshell i could run the external monitor at 144hz. at one point i let the computer go to sleep while still docked. it blue screened on open and threw memory exception errors. ever since then the dock was super laggy and kept causing blue screens and exception errors. i switch to a wd19tb dock ($400 dock) and it can’t seem to drive a 1440p screen at 144hz. getting squiggly lines on everything. and at 60hz it feels like 15-20 fps because everything\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\u200f\\u200f\\u200e\\xadis super chunky dragging and the mouse lags. not usable. can this this just not dock? or coming from macbook pro world are my expectations too high? 4 years ago my mbp plugged into an lg 5k monitor and ran fine. no dock; just a single tb cord. struggling with how this overpowered xps 17 runs like absolute garbage when docked. are we just not meant to dock them? my plan was to use it as a laptop when out of the office and then dock it so i had a large monitor, headset, mouse, keyboard, etc all connected using one cord. i’m also pissed that dell does the 30 day warranty return from invoice date, not the date you receive the device. well because of slow shipping that gave me about 1.5 weeks before that window closed. i tried to return it and i was 5 days past invoice date so they said no, even though i haven’t had the laptop 2 weeks. really frustrated i paid almost $3k and am now stuck with it if anyone has any insight to help make the wd19tb dock work, please let me know. hi all, i have a dell xps 13 9305 that i utilize for work. i have a plastic case i found on amazon that protects the device currently, but i am wondering if anyone knows of any other options that would exist. i work for a fire department, and am frequently running around with it, and have a toddler at home. any suggestions or options? i’ve been wanting an xps 13 for awhile and am finally ready to do so. i really wanted one with a glass display (oled or uhd, doesn’t matter… just don’t want plastic bezels). multiple reviews stated this model comes in all three options: fhd, oled and uhd but dell’s website only lists the fhd version. do these other display options typically come later on? i see the xps 13 plus has these options but not a fan of the capacitive touch row. i’ve seen a colleagues and how vibrant the display was and don’t want to settle for a matte display. my local stores rarely sell xps but one of them finally sell a 9310 xps 13 for $1299 with 16gb of ram and 1tb of ssd with 3.5k oled. is this worth it over the wait for them to bring 9320? should i consider looking for other ultrabook laptop? guys i have an issue with my touchpad on dell xps 15 9520. touchpad is working normally until i plug ac adapter. then touchpad freeze after 5seconds and is frozen - nothing is working. if i unplug, touchpad is working again. please help me. i’m going to buy a 100w charger that’s smaller than the original so it’s more portable and i was wondering if there will be any issues using a non dell charger. i did get an error when using a hub, like the exclamation point on the battery hey guys, just received the laptop and am only able to get ~5-6hrs of battery life. after charging it to 100%, tried to use it as i normally would by watching some youtube videos and browing the internet. the specs for the 9320 i got has the 13.4\" fhd display along with the i7-1260p processor with 16gb ram. is this normal? as ive heard from online reviews that it should at least last for a solid 8-10hrs. hi, so been using it for about 2 weeks now. though the touchpad seems sluggish from what i am used to, but last time i was using it it started to miss click and was more or less unusable when just dragging it in windows. booted up the bios screen and same issues occurred there though somewhat less noticeable.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or48i_pq10q lifting the laptop or pressing down a bit on the lower right side seems to resolve the issue (miss-clicks). not really sure other than contact dell and ask for replacement? https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/dell-xps-15-oled-9520 i have the new 9520, i7 12700h, 3050ti. it works great for the most part, but its kind of killing me that i can\\'t get above like 1150mhz on a 3050ti, a gpu which can run close to double that. this limitation is caused by the fact that my gpu will not draw more than 35w. i have tried everything, but cannot figure this out. according to the specs on dell\\'s website, it should be able to hit 45w, which would dramatically increase my core clock, and therefor framerates. does anyone have any ideas? i\\'ve been using the xps 9510 for music production for just over a month. everything was going fine until i noticed that the audio sub level drops significantly between 60hz and 80hz. i checked on a macbook and verified that it wasn\\'t my headphones. most kicks/sub sit in this range so it\\'s kind of a deal breaker and i will probably need to return it if it can\\'t be fixed. if you also have a 9510, you can listen to this 20hz to 20khz sweep: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pasmldptjx8 and if you experience the same issue, the level should dip between 60hz and 80hz. any advice/fixes would be greatly appreciated. \\u200b edit: i restarted my machine and it fixed the issue. leaving this here in case anyone has the same issue. i\\'m planning to buy a dell xps 13 plus, i5-1240p, 16gb ram and 512gb ssd, fhd+ touch panel and the arriving date is july 20. i\\'m not sure if i can trust this especially i have seen so much delaying complaint on this subreddit in the last year. it\\'s on the yt channel \\'andrew marc david\\' and was streamed 5h ago. strange that nobody else has this notebook yet. tldr: he has the oled version, i am not yet through but seems to be all good got the same with my xps15. worst buy ever. never will i buy anything g from dell again ever. i assume you\\'ve checked windows control center for the \\'when the lid is closed\\' in the power management setting in control center. the other possible solution which usually works is to make sure the bios and drivers are up to date. if that\\'s not the issue then a factory reset is your best bet. though if that doesn\\'t do it then i don\\'t know. 🥺 best of luck! the battery is probably bloated. so i am getting the new xps 13 plus as a work laptop and i am wondering which display to get? i don\\'t care much about battery as it will be plugged in almost all the time. should i go with the 400nit oled or the 500nit uhd panel? is the oled really not as bright? this is really surprising to me. here are the specs i am going with - xps 13 plus graphite intel core i7 1280p 32gb ddr5 5200mhz ram 512gb ssd (upgrading later to 2tb samsung 980 pro) 3.5k oled display or 4k uhd display ubuntu os (we already have windows licenses so i am getting the ubuntu model as it will be nice to have the dell ubuntu image to dual boot with windows) also does anyone have the xps 13 plus yet? how do you like it? spec 60hz 3.5k oled rtx3050ti i7-2700h 32gb ram problem any game i play, (e.g. bfv or master duel) it seems the screen tears very consistently. just wondering if theres some additional setup i need to configure for this laptop to game properly. the framerate is stable and everything else seems good, its just the screen tearing that is the issue. note: i am enabling vsync, and have also tried disabling too hey, backstory - new xps 17 9710 from dell - bought new dell wd19tbs dock from amazon - set up laptop while connected to charger (not dock). installed all available updates, including dell firmware and drivers. - laptop worked at this point - connected laptop to dock - laptop started having performance and graphics issues - laptop wouldn’t post, nor would it allow entering bios or even bios recovery. just saw dell logo when it powered on, then nothing. - laptop wouldn’t post or do anything useful then, even if the dock was unplugged. - dell sent a technician who replaced the motherboard - laptop worked when connected to its charger - laptop connected to dock - laptop then exhibited issues again where it turned on, the dell logo appeared, then nothing. no ability to get into bios or bios recovery. - laptop intermittently flashed 2 amber lights followed by 8 white, suggesting a graphics fault. - dell arranged a system replacement which is going to take weeks - my colleague was leaving their job and sent me their laptop, an xps 17 9700. - i set up the laptop from my colleague while connected to the charger, not the dock. - no issues noticed with laptop current issue - i connected the xps 17 9700 to my dell wd19tbs dock - when the system boots, i see vertical bars of black horizontal lines on my external dell u4919dw monitor - the laptop experiences performance issues and grinds to a halt i only experience issues while the dock is connected. the internal display does not exhibit these issues when i run the laptop with its charger plugged in, rather than the dock. if anyone has any suggestions regarding troubleshooting or what might be wrong, i’d appreciate any input. thank you image of black lines on screen: https://imgur.com/a/dmpzq6z if this isn\\'t appropriate, please let me know and i will delete, but this details an ongoing issue/saga i\\'m currently having with dell premium support. i know some of it might be self-inflicted and i am aware. extremely tl;dr multiple \\'misinformation\\', even attempted deceit and still no replacement or repaired product over 45 days so, after a long deliberation of what laptop to buy, i settled on the arctic white xps 9510 3050ti - touch 16gb/1tb from best by, knowing there could be some issues with a trackpad, but i was willing to deal with the laptop lottery if it meant that i can get most, if not all of the other features i wanted. fastforward about a month after i purchased the laptop and the top left corner of the trackpad was raising so much so, that it was sitting above the palm rest and actually jabbing into my palm. i submitted the issue and very quickly got a response and was asked to provide pictures, which i gladly did and they created a work order, and said everything would be good for in-home repair the next week. ten minutes later i received an email about the part being backordered an no availability at this time, this is where the beginning of the saga began. i emailed immediately and they replied with \\'no its just because the shipping department is closed for the night, its not back ordered and you will be fine tomorrow\\'. come the next day, and i received an email from a different technician say the part was backorder, no eta, and to just \\'wait it out\\'. i immediately replied stating what the previous tech said, and that the laptop is practically unusable because of the sharp corner of the trackpad. they then stated that the technician miscommunicated, and there was nothing he could do. i followed up with a different technician every day for a week, with no eta early than 45 days out from the date i had submitted the issue. i kept pressing for an update or at least a replacement of any kind, and they said come the following monday if there is no eta still, they would escalate to the exchange team. come that monday, i received an email that the part i had order was shipped for delivery and should arrive at the technician the following day. (of course it was suddenly available) technician arrives, he was a wonderful person, and sat down and disassembled the laptop in about 20 minutes, until he got to the motherboard where he found out a handful of the screws were stripped and he was worried that if he got them out he would make them worse. so he escalated to a send in repair. after about a week of waiting i get the box and send it into the service center. about 3 days later i received the laptop, and the palmrest was seemingly replaced as it had a plastic cover on it. i flip the laptop over, install my upgraded ram, and when installing it, i now notice, not only the previous stripped screws were still installed, but all of the screws holding the battery in are also now stripped. no big deal in the end to me. i flipped the laptop back over, removed the plastic cover, and to no surprise, the track pad was almost exactly as i had sent it in, raised above the palm rest. it seems like they potentially tried to push the trackpad down, or whatever replacement part was also defective. so i immediately hopped back on support and reported it again. this time they escalated it to the exchange team almost immediately. the exchange team reached back out to me with a decently specc\\'d system, for all intents and purposes, it was an upgrade. 32gb vs the 16 and a 2tb vs the 1tb in my original spec, but i had already upgraded those myself on my previous system, so it wasn\\'t a value to me, but the issue was it wasn\\'t in white. sure, this is a bit of a first world problem, but i specifically sought out and bought a white one because that is the one i wanted, so i replied stating \\'i have a white one and this was a black one\\' and 24hours later i got an email stating \\'the replacement we have is silver exterior with blank interior\\' do you accept? i replied with my obvious frustration, especially since all of this has built up for so long at this point, and stating those two upgrades are unnecessary for me, i would even take a downgrade to a 512gb white one if they could just get me that model. no response for the rest of the day, and then a response on monday stating that the white one i saw was no longer available, that the one they were offering me already has upgraded memory and ram so i wouldn\\'t need to use mine that i bought separately. i replied saying, if i were to take this model, i would like to talk about having a new warranty instead of the month i\\'ve lost dealing with this already, and get it overnighted to me since that is what the support rep said they could do. no response for two days, until i push for some sort of update. finally get a response saying that the white one is still unavailable(didnt ask but okay at least they are \\'trying\\'), and that if i wanted to do warranty transfers i would have to open a separate support ticket????, and that my case is now marked as priority response, but that the previous rep \\'miscommunicated on the ability to overnight\\' i said fine i\\'ll take the offered one and deal with the warranty stuff myself, but this is now at least the second \\'miscommunication\\' during this whole process. come three hours later i get a response saying that the \\'originally offered model was no longer available to be processed\\' and i was offered two different models. turns out, the day there was no response, the unit wasn\\'t held for my replacement and was sold. so, the two new models i was being offered was an arctic white unit or a black interior, 3050(not ti) 1200p non touch model as my two options. i then realized that the arctic white one they were offering me was the \\'scratch and dent\\' model i had seen on their refurb site earlier in the day, since it was no longer listed. obviously, neither of these two models are valid replacements at this point, especially since it was a significant downgrade (over $500 cheaper) for the black unit, and the white one was scratch and dent. i pushed back a bit and asked if i can escalate it. i was told that it will take up to 48 to confirm \\'escalation availability\\' and then if i could escalate it to their manager then i would need to schedule out time to have the meeting. she also asked that i wait another 3-5 business days to see if they can \\'find\\' a replacement one that fits all the requirements, either a white one or a black one with the upgraded specs, since she said that\\'s what her manager would suggest anyways.. this is currently where i\\'m sitting at with them and will update with more information as i get it. again, if this is no appropriate for this sub, please let me know and i will pull it down \\u200b update: 6/20 - they have offered me the same white one they offered before, that was potentially from their scratch and dent. i pushed back to see if they can provide me any more information about the device, like why it was a refurb, what happens if i receive it and it still has issues, and all that. since this is a spec for spec ( except for the fact it has win 10??? which i didnt even think these had an option to come with it ), replacement, they won\\'t approve a refund or a \\'new\\' model until they attempt to send this one out. \\u200b update: 6/23 - received the white replacement. its actually in worse trackpad shape then before. the whole left side of the trackpad is above the palmrest instead of just the top left corner. so lets see what happens now \\u200b update: 6/24 - hopefully the last update in the saga. received a call from the corporate escalations team in regards to this. he noted all of my chat logs and all of my email interactions and has offered to give me a 9520 instead. interestingly enough, he noted the white ones currently are no longer being produced (delay or otherwise he wouldnt tell me) unfortunately he said it will take a couple weeks to get. this isnt what i was even asking for, i just wanted a working 9510 but i am grateful. i\\'m still wishy washy about buying future models from dell, but in the end they did make this one right in the long run. hopefully this new model comes in and has no issues. ill update as needed going forward. i have a dell xps 13 9310. the killer ax500 stopped working, the wi-fi switch in windows is permanently turned off. if i try to switch it on it will just go back into the off position. windows detects killer ax500 driver, but in the bios it shows wi-fi device is none. bluetooth it shows installed. anyone know a fix for this i recent got a replacement from dell for my dell xps 13. the first month it worked just fine, no issues to report. but randomly it would not power on when pressing down on the button, i had to press down and hold for it to boot up. i was able to narrow it down not being anything wrong with the power button itself as when i am all booted up the button seems to register every press i do. addtionaly to that the lid switch feature would randomly turn on the laptop when the lid is close as well. currently running the laptop as when there is ac power it would boot up. has this happen to anyone recently as i am not covered with dell support at the moment, try to see if there is a fix out there my 9500 is out of warranty and is having problems that i\\'m not willing to pay for to get fixed. i decided to pay and get the 2022 xps 15 9520 version. i was wondering if i could keep the 9500 as a parts replacement. such as battery replacement? and if my screen goes bad, can i use my uhd+ screen from the 9500 as a replacement to the 9520? if so, i will keep it as a parts replacement instead of just throwing it away. will there be any compatibility issues? this is all assuming i don\\'t care to contact dell for warranty claims or anything. not sure what to make of these new parts in the new xps 13 9315. it seems like they could be small, mighty little powerhouses or underwhelming, compared to the p series in the 13 plus (which has gotten alot of news coverage). it\\'s not a step backward from 11th gen stuff like the i7-1195g7 is it? \\u200b clearly this machine wasn\\'t intended for gaming or cpu intensive tasks, considering it\\'s been made even lighter than before with a smaller mobo, etc! hi all, i\\'m trying to find the original dell ubuntu recovery image for my xps 9320. i ordered it with ubuntu, but formatted the drive. now i need to get back to dell\\'s factory image, cause the official ubuntu distribution doesn\\'t contain the proprietary drivers (e.g. webcam doesn\\'t work) steps i have tried so far: https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/osiso/linux returns \"recovery image not available for your service tag.\" when service-tag is entered. support assist | bios connect is able to download 4/4 files via internet, then freezes upon countdown with 1 second left. it should reboot into the recovery os, but that never happens. os recovery tool (running on windows) is able to recognize my service-tag but it\\'s stuck in an endless looping stating \"finding the best recovery option for you\" \\u200b anyone got an idea? support just sends me the same documentation links over and over again. thanks! \\u200b edit: recovery image now available on the website (see step 1). i uploaded the xps 9320 ubuntu recovery image here: https://mega.nz/file/bf9qaait#5dnhjb9htm9xa-rodx_ejout20lb9jpug9kgst1dhym has anyone came up with any fix for this yet? literally can’t use this for ableton or anything music related which is sad as it is specked out, thankfully i use it for work mainly but it’s been almost a year and no fix or update for this. so, i am still within my send it back and get a new one warranty. it is a month old. today when i turned it on it shut off randomly and i wasn\\'t sure what to do. should i send it back, or is there something i am missing in settings. i have read it could be related to sleep mode and rebooting is not working. please advise. i just ran the support app and updated windows and the driver. unsure what else i can or should do /: edit: just unplugged from power source. will not turn on hi, i got a firmware update this morning via fwupd for version 1.10.1 on a dell xps 9510. however, i can\\'t find any information about this version. it is possible it hasn\\'t been released on dell\\'s website yet? it would be great to see a changelog. dell xps 15 9520 - new firmware 0.1.3.0 just installed via windows update. i can\\'t find any information on it. can anyone help with a link release notes? \\u200b i\\'m hoping to see a fix for my relatively lower performance compared to other 9520\\'s with the same specs. \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/vpnm7cdokf591.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcb2508b1234ff57989201b54c7bd3e5ee0d71e thanks my 9520 i5/iris xe/16gb/512gb/fhd+ was delivered on 10 june, ordered on 16 april. the wait was quite long and my contact with dell customer service wasn\\'t the best, but i really like this device and am excited to use it in my homelab environment. i have no issues with any aspect of this laptop so far. the i5-12500h shreds all manner of tasks i throw at it. the bluetooth and wifi are stellar. though the stock samsung drive is fast i replaced it with a 1tb 980 pro. i would say opening the device chassis can be tricky the first time, but dell didn\\'t do anything overly-obnoxious to make it difficult to access the internals. the display brightness goes up to 500 nits and looks great if all you are doing is surfing the web. i don\\'t really want to play many games on this, but i have tried divinity 2 on medium settings and the iris xe graphics worked it like a champ. the fans have good controls on them and do a great job keeping the system cool without sounding like a c130. the fingerprint sensor is very responsive, the keyboard and trackpad are spacious and comfortable to use, and the overall build is incredibly solid. the battery in my unit is an 86whr and in my short time i can say it just keeps on going. the included 90w charger does the job but i picked up a 130w dell unit to charge even faster. feel free to ask me anything about this device! decided on an xps 17 9720 since i can get it on an educational discount of about 33% off. deciding on i7 vs i9 (12th gen)...are the i9\\'s overheating too much? ram...need 32 or 64, is it better to get dual-channel 3200 from amazon vs. the dell 4800? (adds $100 for their 32gb) - may as well re-paste since i\\'ve heard that\\'s an issue. same with hd.....standard spec is 512gb ssd (add $66 for their 1tb)? not planning on using it for gaming, and not too much remote work so i\\'m not too worried about the battery. do need lots of ram for memory intensive programs for work and day trading programs. anyone has any recommendations for a usb-pd charger for the 9520? i think this generation is a lot more lenient with what chargers it\\'ll accept. my 65watt chargers work. if anyone has a 100w pd charger, could you check that it works and that it actually charges at a 100w? i bought an xps 17 9710 off ebay a week ago, and i have noticed an oil-like fluid oozing from one side of the 90w charger that came with it. the charging brick also gets painfully hot, to the point that its plastic housing is becoming deformed. it usually stops charging after half an hour because of the heat. is it dangerous to keep using it? should i just go ahead and replace it? i normally don\\'t do reviews of the products i get, but, the xps 13 plus made me just share this with those planning on getting one. dell!, you have designed the most beautiful laptop i\\'ve seen, and i\\'m very serious. have had it for 3 days already and i\\'m as excited as day one with this beautiful machine. very recommended for those wanting an ultra portable laptop and something to impress people around you while seating at starbucks hi, i just got the xps 9520 at work. the wd22tb4 works as expected. but at home i have an older wdtb16, this one does not give any sign of life other than a message regarding slow charging. when i tried charger + tb16 dock my usb keyboard connected via the dock flashed couple of times but thats about it. the power button on the dock works but other than that nothing else. any ideas? for those of you who\\'ve already received yours, how\\'s your battery life like? anyone try undervolting or underclocking? i\\'m trying to decide whether i should keep my order (with the fhd screen) or get an xps 15 instead and i think battery life is the biggest reason i\\'d switch. why? a lot of laptops have been getting the i7-1260p, which is 28w rated 4 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. the xps 13 plus gets the i7-1280p option which goes up to 6 p cores instead of just 4. now, the xps 13 9315 was just announced with a mere i7-1250u with just 2 p cores. and this isn’t the same 15w i7-1255u the spectre x360 14 (called 13.5 now) is getting, but instead it’s a 9w processor. that’ll put its performance at like half than the max spec xps 13 plus. sure you might be getting better battery life with this 9513, but if you’re a performance user, it’s really in the lacking area overall. it still beats the 11th gen intel offerings tho, by far. let’s not forget it does equal to 10 cores including the 8 e cores it also has, but for anyone serious on cpu performance, there are better options out there. here’s some of my i7-1260p benchmarks with the yoga 9i 14 gen 7 from lenovo in case you want to see a build that would reflect a bit how it would be with the xps 13 plus. https://egpu.io/forums/builds/2022-14-lenovo-yoga-9i-gen-7-12th12cp-rtx-3070-32gbps-tb4-razer-core-x-win11-22h2/#post-100771 i ordered the 9520 a few days after availability and received it a couple of weeks later. this was intended to be a replacement for my xps-15 9550. all seemed fine...got it set up and then swapped out the machines (i.e. connected to my existing usb-c docking adapter. still seemed fine, but on the second day the batter indicator said plugged in but not charging...the battery just kept dropping...tried disconnecting dock and running off the included power supply and still dropping, dropping dropping ... not charging... did a phone session with support to no avail....the guy\\'s conclusion was that the power supply was bad....which simply wasn\\'t the case cause i had two alternative usb-c power supplies and none of them would charge the battery. i ended up returning the 9520 for a refund. after a couple of weeks ... rethought it all and decided the new xps machines were really what i needed/wanted (i do digital art primarily) and ordered the big brother the 9720 ... it arrived after 10 days or so (faster than the 9520) and long story short ... essentially the same experience. i can\\'t imagine that it was all caused by my third-party usb-c docking adapter (100w pd) ... but maybe.... the new 9720 was returned last week. :( btw the bios showed the charging/adapter at only 5 watts or so ... something definitely fucked... anyone else have this kind of problem? and call me a fool, but i reordered a second (third new xps) 9720 as well as the \\'official\\' dell docking adapter (wd22tb4). it all should arrive this week. the plan is to keep it completely isolated running only on its included power supply and connection to my desktop (monitor, keyboard, external drive) only through the included hdmi/usb adapter...for the first few days and see what happens with battery/charging/etc. (could it be i\\'ve just being a ninny about the battery dropping and it would perhaps begin charging when it hit bottom or some low percentage?) i hope i haven\\'t wasted both my time and dell\\'s as well as a bunch of money and frustration... \\u200b anyone seen this battery/charging issue or had it happen to them? thanks! is there a way to force the pcie to gen 3.0 instead of the gen 4.0? bios/uefi has no option it seems to change the pcie gen https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/dell-announces-all-new-redesigned-xps-13-and-xps-13-2-in-1-premium-laptop-and-folio-pcs-for-2022 yes!! pricing is not announced yet but it has the same guts as the 9315, i\\'m guesstimating they\\'ll start at $1200 usd for an i5 with 8gb of & 256gb ssd configuration. would love an i5 config with 16gb ram and a 1tb ssd - need room for my drum sample library. looks like that will def run into the $1500 usd range though which is mighty expensive. im a student and need a laptop for solid works, eplan, tia portal and all the other usual automation programs. will this laptop be good enough to run all these programs? i think this is a bit of a unique situation. i bought a dell xps laptop in 2019 for $1,500. it is a pleasure to use when it works, but these laptops do not have the best build quality. i also purchased a 4 year extended warranty which was the best $500 i ever spent. in total, i paid $2000 for my first laptop. i\\'ve had a total of 4 replacement laptops (and various repairs). in my last case dell was so fed up that they decided to send me a brand new xps 9520 laptop. my 4 year warranty expires next year, so i called dell to see if i could extend it. the dell rep quoted 3 extra years (new warranty would expire in 2026) with accidental damage for $950, or 3 extra years without accidental damage for $650. they sent me these quotes via email so i can purchase it any time within the next 30 days. i figure that this wouldn\\'t necessarily be a bad deal. instead it would guarantee me a working laptop for at least 7 years total, including the past 3 years from when i originally purchased the laptop. the cost of the original laptop plus both extended warranties (if i got accidental damage) would be $3,000. i figure it would be the equivalent of buying a $1500 laptop once every 3.5 years. at this point i have 3 options buy the warranty and keep the laptop keep the laptop and let the warranty expire next year (i don\\'t lose money here, but worst case scenario i may have to buy a brand new laptop for $2500 2 years down the line if this laptop were to break) sell the laptop, buy a different brand (would rather not do this because i don\\'t necessarily think other brands have guaranteed better build quality other than macbook, and i hate macos. is there a way to force the pcie to gen 3.0 instead of the gen 4.0?

or it will just run out of battery lets say in 16 hours despite having some power delivered ? the idea of having only once usb-c cable connected to my laptop seems amazing. 2) i order to deliver the necessary power i plugged my laptop with original usb charger to classic house electric socket (the warning about not enough power obviously disappeared), but kept the usb-c cable from monitor plugged in in order to be able to have 2 monitors. does my laptop currently get power both from normal charger and monitor or is the laptop software smart enough to just charge with charger and use monitor for just display? i am worried that i am using too much power, is it possible ? i have the same (well, the 1260p model with oled). have you tried turning on hdr on the desktop? every time i do, the black levels are all wrong and black is no longer black but more of a grey. wondering if anyone has had the same issue and sorted it out. this doesn\\'t happen on my desktop pc with my alienware aw3423dw when i enable hdr - black is always, well, black. disclaimer: i know all these rather pricey items might make me look bad, so let me clarify that i\\'m 47 and am just living it up a little before i get too old to to enjoy the disposable income that i have. everyone, i need some help. i have a new dell xps 15 9520 laptop and i\\'m attempting a clean install of windows 11. to my knowledge, i have correctly installed the media creation tool on my computer and then downloaded windows to a brand new usb. once i restarted my laptop i had a small issue with not being able to boot to usb but i figured that out and was able to boot to usb. once i boot to usb, i then begin to install windows and go through the normal process of selecting language and stuff like that. i am then given a page where i select the drive to install to. i\\'ve seen this in many other tutorials and expected to see my hard drive and the partitions that i would then delete and then select my hard drive and move forward. that\\'s not what happened. once the page opens up, i see no drives whatsoever. no drives, no partitions, nothing. i can rescan to search for the drives or i can browse. when i browse, i see some different folders and stuff alike but don\\'t know what to do. i\\'ve attempted to post this to the windows subreddit but it gets auto deleted for some stupid reasons. kinda lost right now. i live in southern california and the form factor for the 13 plus is really interesting and i’ve been on the market for a new laptop. i just want to see it and hold it before i pull the trigger. i don’t see that it is available in stores in any physical retailers for me to touch it. have you guys seen anywhere that it is available outside of online? hi guys, here is my problem, i own a lg 27up850-w 27 monitor which allows me to charge my laptop via usb-c. after organising my setup with one cable (meaing all usb devices plugged into monitor, and monitor connected only with usb-c to laptop) i saw a warning on my laptop that the power that my monitor (96w) provides is not enough for dell xps (which needs about 130w i heard). i have two questions: what are the consequences of using one cable setup, will my dell perform worse ?

hi all. i just got the new xps 15 9520 and switched it from raid to ahci by following this guide as i\\'ll need to dual-boot windows and linux. however, after successfully changing to ahci, the ssd read speed dropped from nearly 7000 mb/s to 4500mb/s. what\\'s more annoying is that hibernate doesn\\'t work anymore. upon waking from hibernation, windows either crashes and gives the recovery options blue screen, or it boots up with all the apps closed (essentially a restart). does anyone know how to solve this?

i am worried that i am using too much power, is it possible ? i just got a replacement 9520, and they haven\\'t picked up the 9500 yet (will be a couple of days). so i\\'ve been comparing the two laptops. they\\'re both running off of cloned ssds, so it\\'s basically a hardware comparison. the 9520 is much cooler in normal tasks. they 9500 heats up even when watching a video or when transferring files to an external disk. i don\\'t even hear the 9520\\'s fans in the same tasks. qc wise, zero issues with the 9520. the 9500 had several issues (i got trackpad problems, charging problems, 4k playback problems). externally, the laptops are absolutely the same. if anyone has any interesting comparative questions, let me know! i\\'ve got the uhd versions of both laptops with the 3050ti/1660ti. does anyone know if the new xps 15 9520 can use the 3050 ti for rendering or gaming on a external monitor? i read that the 9510 doesn\\'t have the option and only the 17\" model can do this. i\\'m considering buying this laptop however i am unsure what processor and memory i\\'ll pick. i\\'ll use this for school stuff like browsing, ms office, online labs (i\\'m a chem student), and statistics app (e.g., statistica). i\\'ll also use it for occasional photo and video editing, and gaming (pokemon). will i5-1240p be enough?

i\\'m very surprised, as almost every other laptop that came out in 2022 (including dell\\'s own alienware laptops) supports wifi 6e. this is just a small issue but it\\'s making me think twice about buying this laptop. however, i\\'m thinking maybe this is just a typo, because it seems weird to me that it only supports wifi 6. by the way, i tried asking their support but they were extremely useless. they basically just read what it says on the website and could not verify independently which wifi version the laptop has. my 9520 doesn\\'t have this problem and snaps pretty tightly together, does actually feel like magnets are holding the lid together. let me start by saying that i bought the laptop second hand after searching for a new laptop for couple of months my budget was around 2000 usd and my demands were harsh because i came from a macbook pro i wanted the same feeling using this laptop as the feeling i had using the macbook and my demands were : thin&light and fairly small, nice screen, powerful and nice looking. the only laptop i could find that was answering my demands was the asus g14, but after reading some of the negative posts about problems and poor qc people were having with it i backed down and opened facebook marketplace and found the xps 15 it was the i9 11900h, 16gb ram, 1tb ssd, 4k oled touch display and 3050ti i managed to get it for 1950usd and it a very good deal for my county (not from usa) since the price on the same model but new was about 4000- 4500 usd and after using it for a few days heres my review on it screen - amazing yet gimmicky the 4k oled touch is very nice with an amazing colors and great media consuming device tho i would never notice if it was 2k only and the touch screen is nice to have but its not a deal breaker because the laptop itself isnt 2 in 1 i used my finger on the screen once or twice since i got it so if you’re on the lookout for a new laptop get it with 2k max to save money i/o - i do understand the lack of ports due to the thinnes of the machine none of my peripherals are type c or tunderbolt capable so if you dont have an adapter or a dock you basically screwed luckily i still got the dock from my old macbook so keep in mind when getting one you’ll probably need to get a dock and i would recommend a good quality one keyboard and touch pad - absolutely amazing not a single bad word i can say on both of them the keyboard is perfect and i got to a point where i can type without looking at it in about an hour because its so good and nice to type on and the touch pad is massive and on apple level performance - although i haven’t done a lot of work on it yet i played some games on it and even though i know its not a gaming laptop i managed to play some games on high setting with good fps without getting that warm. the fans do kick in but it wasn’t to the point that im feeling that i am standing next to fighter jet but if you dont do any cad work or heavy processing work an i7 will suit you fine battery - so i do move alot and i wanted to have something powerful yet portable but im always near an outlet and if you buy this laptop in this configuration youll need to be also because the battery is horrible and i could get about only 5 hours but i get it becuse im rocking pretty heavy specs with the i9 and 3050ti so in conclusion i could have bought something else but im not regretting a thing the laptop itself feels very nice and premium though the specs are a bit overkill for me its nice to have and im very happy with the purchase in that price and i feel like the laptop is going to serve me good for the next couple of years anyway feel free to ask me anything and ill do my best to reply p.s please do you’re best to ignore some of the grammar mistakes english isn’t my first language maybe i should wait and post this when my laptop arrives however i\\'m wanting to get ahead and try and figure this out now. i ordered my 9520 with microsoft office. will mo come pre-installed ready to use or will it come with a product key needed to activate and install? the reason i\\'m asking this is because i will be doing a clean install basically immediately out of box of windows 11. i\\'m trying to figure out if i\\'ll need to backup/transfer mo to a usb/external drive so i won\\'t lose it during the clean install of win 11? or alternatively, if it just comes with a product key then it seems that i wouldn\\'t have to backup/transfer mo because there\\'s nothing to backup or transfer, i would just not use my activation key until after i\\'ve clean installed win 11. all this may sound retarded and convoluted but i\\'m just wanting to do this right without fucking myself over and losing mo that i paid 150 bucks for. any and all advice is appreciated, thanks. i purchased a new dell xps 8950 from costco. above and below the graphics card, there are 2 empty/available pcie x4 lanes. my elgato cam link pro does not seem to be working in either lane. i installed all necessary drivers for the elgato on the computer, did restarts, did all troubleshooting, no luck. i took out the elgato cam link pro and tested it on another computer, and it worked fine with no issues. did i just get a faulty computer or? is anyone else getting intermittent trackpad lag where the trackpad seems to have around a 50ms delay? it feels like i\\'m running through a remote desktop app or something. nothing i do seems to have any effect. it comes and goes frequently. it seems to happen more often when plugged in. it makes it very hard to use the laptop. xps 9520 got a new 9720 with two 1tb ssds. i noticed its in raid mode in the bios. apparently dell does that by default. should i change to achi? whats the benefits? hi there, i will be ordering a xps 13 plus or xps 15 soon. on dell\\'s website some comments mention a terrible battery life for either the 13+ or 15, however i am not sure how reliable those reviews are. i am using a latitude 5420 for work and the battery life is pretty impressive, so i would expect that a newer high-end model from dell would perform equally well. can anyone comment on the battery live on those models? also, i expect that the 13+ with all hardware customizayions maxed out has amazing performance with multitasking on 2x 2k monitor, is this correct? (will not be gaming ofc with integrated graphics) thanks! hi! how can i check if my nvidia card is working ? i have rtx 3050 ti mobile and win 11 what does the screen feel like on this model, is it the same as the non touch? i want the 4k screen but not the nasty feel of a a resistive touch screen. would i be able to connect three qhd monitors at 120 hz to my xps 9510, preferably using a dock? it seem like the total required bandwidth would be almost 40 gbit/s (39.81). since the 9510 only has a single tb controller, does that mean it\\'s impossible? thanks i work as a tech replacing parts on dell machines. today i had a dispatch where i was to replace the motherboard on one of these machines because of a wifi issue. i replaced the part and found that the keyboard was not working so i reseated the ribbon cable a few times. it eventually began to work and i was able to enter the service tag and began running the epsa test. i almost immediately got an error message saying the ribbon cable for the keyboard was disconnect and could not proceed with the test. after being completely certain that the cable was well seated and continuing to get the error message i ended up calling dspq who suggested updating the bios. maybe it was because these particular xps models have the ssd sawdered onto the motherboard and the one that was shipped was likely unimaged because i kept getting a \"no bootable device found\" error, regardless of what bios settings i tried. eventually, i just ended up getting it sent for depo service. i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever had an instance of working on that particular model without something going wrong; and i\\'d like to prevent that. was there something else i could have done in this case? i purchased a new dell xps 8950 from costco. above and below the graphics card, there are 2 empty/available pcie x4 lanes. my elgato cam link pro does not seem to be working in either lane. i installed all necessary drivers for the elgato on the computer, did restarts, did all troubleshooting, no luck. i took out the elgato cam link pro and tested it on another computer, and it worked fine with no issues. did i just get a faulty computer or? anyone have any advice? hey everyone! i\\'m thinking of purchasing a new dell xps laptop but i\\'m stuck on whether i should buy the dell xps 13 plus or the 15. i am looking to do some heavy browing and light video and photo editing using programs like vegas pro, premier pro, lightroom, and photoshop. the 13 plus looks absolutely amazing and i partially want to get it because of its portability and really good asthetics. but i am unsure if the integrated graphics (intel iris xe) is good enough to performance all the tasks i need effectively. the 15 is bigger and has a dedicated gpu (nvidia rtx 3050 ti) but is also uses the outdated design and is more expensive. what would you recommend i do? any help in making this decision would be great :) order date: 21st may specs: fhd, 32gb, 1tb, i7 eta shows 23rd june thanks. brand new xps 15 9520 with very poor performance i just got this new laptop and disabled all non windows services rebooted and ran geekbench5.4.5. it got the lowest score of all results for 9520, not just by a little, but by a lot. ~18-25% lower on all tests. it\\'s plugged in and located a large room with a/c. when i compare result details with other 9520\\'s the report details are nearly identical, except i see their memory speed is reported at 2394mhz, while mine is reported at 967mhz. when i load up cpu-z, and review the memory tab i can see the speed of the memory on my laptop changing all over the place. at times up to 2394mhz but mostly at 997mhz. i\\'m not sure if this is a simple fix such as an os setting, bios setting, geekbench software issue. more concerning is if i have a hardware issue perhaps with the memory or controller? any ideas what this could be? troubleshooting steps to try? thanks for any help. results here - dell inc. xps 15 9520 - geekbench browser \\u200b \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/kt1jfqibc9491.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=73eead6498f20c1de6c59922e425d300812d7d0f i recently bought a dell xps 13 9305 and i\\'ve been thinking of getting a usb c wall charger to charge all of my devices (one with multiple output such as this), and i wondered if this is possible with this laptop (i\\'d hate to buy a charger only for it not to work). i ask because i read somewhere that certain oems lock out pd from third party sources. i looked everywhere and couldn\\'t find anything related to this particular model, but in general the consensus seemed to be to proceed at my own risk. does anyone here have experience with using third party usb c chargers with dell laptops? also - there are a bunch of usb c docks on amazon which support power delivery that interest me, would those work as well? last question, is using a higher rated power source (100w versus the stock dell charger\\'s 65w) harmful in the long run for battery health? thanks :) does anyone use a dell xps for audio production? i have a dell xps 9310 and i cannot figure out how to make the waves maxxaudiopro default to being disabled. anyone know how to do this? every time i connect a new audio device (whether via usb, bluetooth or the 3.5mm audio jack) it re-enables with some default effects that sound terrible and i have to go find maxxaudiopro and turn it off again. every time. very annoying. thanks. it\\'ll last you about 3 years before you want to upgrade, up to about 5 years before it really needs to be replaced. after 9 years the hinges will go and it will be irreparable. battery will last about 3 years before you notice it doesn\\'t hold much charge, but you can buy a new one on ebay for $20-40. swapped to win11 on my work machine at home, kinda loving centered taskbar and a few other things, loving the easy window snap feature, etc. i\\'m guessing 9710 and 9720 ship with win11 so figured it might be around time when they ironed out any kinks for win11 for 9700, so just wondering if dell got around to it, don\\'t want to swap and then find out i have worse battery life or something. hello, i need a new laptop for september and so i bought an asus zenbook oled 14 with a 12th gen i7 processor which was fantastic. the 2.8k and oled screen, along with quiet fans and great battery life made this the perfect laptop to me for the price range. however, i couldn’t get the sound to work on linux after many hours of debugging and i figured that even if i could get it fixed during the vacations, i need a reliable system for studying. so i returned it. i’m now considering the dell xps 13 plus with the i5 processor. combined with the student offer, it enters my price range. on the website, you can chose to have ubuntu pre-installed on it, which indicates it may have a great linux support out of the box. however, i’m quite nervous about the new captive buttons as they need special drivers, do you think they will work on linux? will the battery life be good on linux too? i really don’t want to use windows and if this laptop cannot run linux properly, i’ll just settle for another laptop as i cannot wait 1.5-2 months (as people on the internet waited) to have it just to return it. thanks in advance! does anyone know why there is no longer the non-touch option for the xps 13 plus? i ordered non touch over a month ago and still is not in production. wondering if this is why things are taking so long. looking into replacing my xps 9330 from 2014. it still works reasonably well despite having high temps, and it\\'s crashing with increasing frequency because of it (maybe once a week). i\\'m also looking into building a pc for the first time in over a decade, but still need a daily driver. so, i\\'m considering last year\\'s xps 13 from the outlet that would probably be mid/higher spec vs basic/mid spec on a newer xps, but from the few reviews i\\'ve seen, they typically review the top end models which is fine for the old xps, but not helpful for the new one. i\\'m a bit out of touch with the ins and outs of cpu-land these days too, beyond higher clock speeds and more cores go brrrrrrr. i was wondering if it has support for pen input because i don\\'t want to buy a pen if it won\\'t work with it. new to dell. ordered an xps 13 plus with \"13.4 fhd+ (1920 x 1200) infinityedge touch anti-glare 500-nit display\". however on the 9320 information sheet sent to me by sales/customer service, it seems like the only antiglare screen is the non-touch option. per my former understanding, touch screens would be all glossy antireflective, not matte antiglare. i was wondering whether anyone could confirm or clarify? does dell have had antiglare touch screens before? personally antiglare (i.e. matte) matters much more to me than touch and hence the question. thanks in advance. recently i don\\'t have access to my gaming pc so i just use the xps 15 (9510) laptop for some gaming. i play league of legends and pubg. for league of legends, i set the resolution to 2k and quality to low. i can get fps above 60 for most of the time, but sometimes it drop below 60 for few seconds. for pubg, i set resolution to 1920 and everything to very low. initially, the game can reach 60 fps, but after 2 minutes of playing, it dropped to 18-28 fps and remained that low. since the xps 15 has the 3050 ti gpu, i believe there is something wrong with the laptop. even my previous surface book with 965m gpu can achieve better performance than this. can anyone give me some suggestions on how to fix the issue? i am starting college next year and am wondering what laptop would be best to purchase. all opinions are appreciated. thank you for your help. i canceled my order for the new 9320 that i placed over a month ago. basic configuration. it\\'s just taking way too long. going to go with lenovo. good luck to yall out there. i\\'ve searched and found a few answers, but i still have a few questions. i just bought, barely arrived xps 8950 w/ i9, rtx 3070, 32 gb of ram but.. i forgot to upgrade the psu and i\\'m stuck with the 460w and i know it\\'s underpowered. my simple question is, can i buy an after-market evga or corsair or do i need to by an oem dell? just bought a new dell xps 17 9710 and is it just be or do the fans turn on and occasionally get loud when doing normal browsing? i’m already using the quiet profile and i noticed it’s still a bit loud at times. is there any way i can set a manual curve or is it normal? any advice is appreciated! just received an xps 17 (9720) i7, 4k, rtx 3060, 32 gb, and everything is great except for the following. it randomly gets very hot and video starts stuttering and freezing, especially when running on battery power. checking the event logs, i\\'m seeing 10+ of this popup. log name: system source: microsoft-windows-kernel-processor-power event id: 37 task category: (7) level: warning description: the speed of processor 12 in group 0 is being limited by system firmware. the processor has been in this reduced performance state for 71 seconds since the last report. i\\'ve ran diagnostics on the components and everything shows it\\'s working properly. when running the latest nvidia drivers all games and 4k videos stutter and crash, even giving blue screens. rolling back to dell\\'s standard driver reduces the problem but still 4k video and 1080p games begin to stutter and throttle after 15 minutes or so. is this severe throttling or is is something likely wrong with this system? this is my first windows based computer in 16 years. i\\'ve been all apple. macbook pros. mac pro tower. imac, mac mini, i\\'ve been \"all in\". new job however dictates that i need to use windows. they\\'re paying for it...so why not. i got a silver 1000w liquid cooled i7 with 64gb ram, rtx3080 card. 1tb ssd with 2 tb secondary 3.5 drive. i already have two lg27in thunderbolt-3 4k monitors. that my mac pro tower (late 2013 model) was connected to. my question. did i do good for a workstation/gaming rig? it will last a few years? anything i should also do to the tower when it arrives? your xps most likely has 2 8gb sticks in it, so if you were to just buy 1 16gb stick, then you could only have a maximum of 24gb, however it would not run in dual channel which means performance would be limited. if you want dual channel, you need both sticks to be matching in size meaning you\\'ll need to buy 2 x 16gb. it\\'s okay to have two different brands however if your ram has different speeds (3200 is the speed in mhz in ddr4-3200) then it will run at the lowest of the two stick\\'s speed. i am buying myself a new pc and i already decided i wanted the xps 8950. i was pricing it out and noticed that the i5-12600k with water cooling was the same price as the i7-12700 with air cooling. i have read the i5 is a good processor but i was hoping somebody that owned either of these processor configurations in their pc could give me some advice. thanks in advance! watched a youtube review of the new xps 13 plus and noticed how bright those new function row leds are. they apperently dim a bit in a dark room but if you work in evening with lights on they will be very bright all the time. what control do you have over the brightness of those function row leds? can you change the brightness of those leds somewhere in settings and is function row led brightness correlated to how bright you have your backlit keyboard? personally i set my backlit keyboard to maximum but i don\\'t want those function row leds to be full brightness all the time. may 4th . shows label created on may 20th and still not shipped. anyone else waiting for the delivery ? how does your timeline look like? i recently bought an xps 15 9510 last fall. in the past couple of months, i noticed the keyboard has been permanently scratching the screen when closed. there are now significant scratch marks on the display. i am unsure whether the issue was due to the keyboard, panel, or flimsy connection between the two. with several months left on my warranty, i sent the laptop to dell. several days later, i receive an email stating the laptop cannot be repaired because the warranty does not cover \" repair of damage or defects in supported products which are purely cosmetic and do not affect device functionality \", and now they want me to pay for repairs. the screen should not be touching the keyboard. that is a clear workmanship flaw, and continued scratches will hurt visibility on the screen. what\\'s the best way, or is there any way i can fight this? kind of a weird problem here, but i appreciate any help you can offer! i’m also unsure whether this problem is xps-related or windows 11 related, so i’ve posted in both this subreddit and r/windowshelp. i recently got a new dell xps 15 9520 with windows 11 (ver. 21h2) after upgrading from a microsoft surface book 2 with windows 10 (ver. 21h1). my set-up is that i have my laptop an two external monitors, connected via an hdmi-to-usbc hub (specifically this hub: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0746p6lpp). this set-up worked great with my surface book. i could keep the hdmi cables plugged into the hub and then simply plug and unplug the hub from the laptop when necessary. on the surface book, when i plug the hub into the laptop, the laptop immediately recognizes both external monitors. however, on my new laptop, this is not the case. when i plug the hub into the laptop, it only recognizes one of the two external monitors. i have to unplug the other hdmi cable from the hub and then plug it back in to get the laptop to recognize the other external monitor. once i do that, however, it does work. this wouldn’t be a huge problem except that i have the hub hidden behind my desk and i move my laptop around enough that this will certainly get annoying. if anyone has any ideas as to how i might fix this so that the laptop recognizes both external monitors immediately upon plugging in the hub, please let me know. it seems mostly likely that this is being caused by something in windows 11, or by something relating to the fact that the xps 15 has thunderbolt ports, and the surface book did not. i could currently buy an new xps 15 9520 or and xps 17 9710 for 2000$ each. the 17 will have the older 11th gen intel cpu but an rtx 3060, while the 15 will have a 12th gen but an rtx 3050 ti. i’ve heard both are fairly portable so size isn’t really an issue, i’ll definitely be doing some gaming, likely nothing too intensive, but also mostly web surfing and netflix and such. what do you recommend i get? came with an realtek hd audio driver v6.0.9282.1 and the volume is ungodly loud and adjusting the volume slider in windows doesnt do anything. i changed the driver to realtek audio v30.0.101.1631 and its definitely an improvement but now it sounds softer than it should be. i can also now adjust the volume level properly in windows. has anybody experienced this issue or something similar and what did you do to fix it? it seems like the volume should be maybe 20% louder but i haven\\'t been able to find any other audio drivers that work properly. the dell website doesn\\'t recommend the audio driver that i used and installing the max pro audio application doesn\\'t really make any difference either. i’m majoring in finance and cs and i’m stuck between getting a xps 15 9520, or either a g9 or g10 x1 carbon. does anyone have any advice? i wish i could just get a mac but i don’t want to have to run excel on it. hey, i\\'m thinking of purchasing a dell xps 15 9520 for school and am not sure if i should upgrade the cpu from an i7 to an i9 or do the upgrade from fhd to uhd. also do you happen to know if there are any ongoing student discounts available? hi guys, i just bought a new xps 9305 with fhd non-touch and found out the screen has yellow tint issue. i\\'ve contacted dell support and they offered a replacement for the screen. i\\'m wondering will it solve the issue since i read that it\\'s the common issue of dell xps 9305 and 9310 as well. does anyone meet the same issue as me and already got the replacement, could you tell me how\\'s your laptop now?

thank you very much 0 commentssharesaveinsights the ifixit video says, as soon you remove the bottom plate, the screen is accessible and can be removed with a handleful of screws. (timestamped source: https://youtu.be/g4iufnevmcu?t=575). so it should be relatively straightforward. with that said, two questions: does that mean oled and uhd 4k screens are simply interchangeable without issues? what about using a 9510 screen on a 9520 body? i know the chassis is the same but is there an issue weird bios issues because they use different processors? (why i ask: if i ever suffer from the dreaded oled burn-in, i\\'d like to know if i can replace the screen with a uhd 4k panel that won\\'t have that issue.) going to purchase either the 15” (9520) or 17” (9720) this month for college. engineering major but won’t need solidworks support. want: good battery life. i’ve read here about doing a windows reinstall, removing bloatware, and ensuring all updates are installed. will do that. trying to choose between 15” and 17” - will be taking daily for study in student lounge and possibly in-class work (unsure of that yet - will have ipad pro with apple pencil for notes, etc - it was a gift so mixing apple/windows here). also, trying to choose touchscreen uhd or non-touch fhd. seems oled is great but has more battery issues? will be doing lots of matlab work. school recommended at least 16gb memory. planning to go with either 32gb or 64gb. any reason (other than money) not to go 64? hard drive - 500gb minimum recommended. would you go with 1tb? or spend the money on the memory or touch screen instead? also, windows 11 pro and not home is recommended, right? getting the nvidia graphics card. anything else to look at? customizing online and unsure about battery coverage and premium support. thanks for your help! i ordered mine on april 28th the minute it was available on the website. today they told me that they cannot complete the production of my unit because they don\\'t have any german keyboards but are expecting a few thousand keyboards within days. so i was wondering if there is anybody out there (not youtuber) who got their unit? i\\'ve got an xps 9510 which i picked up in summer 2021. i got the 11th gen i7 with 32gb ram, rtx 3050 ti gpu, 1tb ssd and uhd+ display. i love this device, but three things really bugged me: 1) battery life, 2) the constant fan noise and 3) how hot it would randomly get. i had the battery replaced under warranty and that\\'s helped a bit, but i\\'ve accepted that a uhd+ touch panel, with dedicated gpu is going to consume battery. but i wasn\\'t entirely happy with the fan or heat. i spoke with dell about this and they arranged for an engineer to visit to replace the fan and heatsink. the engineer came the next day (who says their customer service is bad?) and replaced them. i have to say, that it is like a new machine, i hardly hear the fans at all and it has managed heat really well. i haven\\'t done any video calls yet, which always kicked the fans into motion, but even when stress testing the hardware in dell\\'s support assist scan, the fans were still quiet. so i wondered if this was just a fault with those components, or whether a newer version of them genuinely helps, but either way it\\'s really helped. so if you\\'re suffering from heat and fan noise, then it\\'s worth speaking with dell because there could be a solution for you. i\\'m just going to add ....... that i also own an m1 pro macbook pro from 2022, and i still much prefer using this xps over that! it\\'s a superb device. i imagine the 9520 with 12th gen silicon is almost the perfect device! sold! \\u200b picture 1 & timestamp seal & timestamp \\u200b for sale: qty. sold 1 on this reddit, have 2 left. - xps 15 9520 laptop (15.6-inch, i9-12900hk, rtx 3050 ti, 32gb ram, 1tb nvme ssd) - each brand new in box (sealed, never opened). \\u200b asking price: - $1,950/each. // $0 no tax, free 1-2 day shipping - no trades- comes with 1 year warranty. \\u200b 15.6\", 3.5k 3456x2160, 60hz, oled, touch, anti-reflect, 400 nit, infinityedge 12th generation intel® core™ i9-12900hk (24mb cache, up to 5.0 ghz, 14 cores) windows 11 home, english nvidia® geforce rtx™ 3050 ti, 4 gb gddr6, 45 w 1 tb, m.2, pcie nvme, ssd 32 gb, 2 x 16 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz, dual-channel \\u200b other notes: - will ship within 24 business hours, ups. - signature is required for delivery due to high valued item. - do not ship international. do not ship to puerto rico or hawaii. only within the u.s.- that means no canada either, unfortunately. - please ensure the shipping address entered when paying the invoice is the address you want it shipped to. otherwise, we\\'ll have to cancel+refund and start over. this is to avoid the obvious fraud. if interested, please reply \"pm\" and send a message. feel free to ask any questions. what should i do? rarely i can sometimes get it to 6,000mw randomly and i don\\'t know how i do it then but right now it\\'s been ridiculous going up to 35w sometimes peaking at 40w... after doing some stuff and stopping defender via safe mode i\\'ve been able to get it to around 25-30w... i know that some people can get it down to like 5w so i don\\'t really know what i\\'m doing wrong here. i disabled the dgpu and hardware acceleration everywhere and in task manager i see that nothing is using cpu/gpu... i\\'m running windows 10 2004 build 19041.630 (enterprise) edit: i went on device manager, disabled the intel igpu and enabled and disabled the nvidia gpu then kept the igpu back on and it seems like i\\'m now at around 15,000mw. i then again enabled the dgpu and the discharge went back to like 35w. still goes up to 20w even after doing that stuff pic below processing img 05di37iq9y291... i bought the new dell xps 15 9520, it comes with 32gb ram, i7-12700h, 1tb ssd and rtx 3050. i was looking for a new laptop that doesn\\'t have a lot of issue with linux. when i received it, windows 11 was installed but i swiped the ssd and installed fedora 36, the installation was really quick, no issue, i encrypted my ssd. on the restart, i was asked the password for the decryption, it worked fine. fingerprint: worked out of the box and it is currently working very well performance: at the moment, it is working well, i\\'m using a virtual machine for some development on windows 10 in parallel of having 10+ tabs in firefox and android studio on the host machine. i\\'m really satisfied. battery: i didn\\'t have time to use it on battery for long enough, but i did all my linux setup (installation + setting up the softwares i use etc...) on battery and at the end i was around 60% of battery. firmware: after the fedora\\'s installation, i was asked to make some updates. a firmware update began and everything was fine after it was completed. trackpad: i read some issue with the trackpad not working correctly and for me i had some minor issue at the beginning where sometime the click wasn\\'t working on the first click but after the firmware update there was no issue at all and it is working well. n.b : you can\\'t use the \"touch\" click (on fedora at least), you have to use the physical button in order to click, the \"touch\" click was working on windows 11 though. edit : you can enable tap to click in touchpad settings. design: really pretty laptop, and the almost borderless screen is a must have. the laptop feels premium and solid. other: - when i\\'m doing heavy tasks, the fans do get quit loud but the laptop isn\\'t hot, i really like the location of the vents output. - waking from sleep is working good - the location of the super / windows key is on the left of the keyboard, i\\'m used to use it on the right so it\\'s kinda annoying but the keyboard is good when coding on it (the feel is way better than my macbook pro) i would recommend it, and if you want to use linux on it, it\\'s working like charm and it has great performance. hello! looking for a new laptop for college (mechanical engineering major). looking for something relatively slim with plenty of power for multitasking and any engineering work i\\'ll be doing. might also do some gaming if i have free time. i\\'m looking at the xps 15 9510 (2021). these are the current specs i\\'m looking at: i7-11800h 16gb ram 3.5k oled 3050ti 4gb it is currently on sale for $1620 instead of the usual $2300. good buy?

i really don\\'t want to return it after waiting 2 months for delivery edit: i have also tried both keyboards on another dell computer i own and it works perfectly fine (running windows 10). and they also worked fine on my macbook pro. hello, i have a problem with my brand new xps 15 that i received last week. it is running professional edition of windows 11. my problem is that any cabled keyboard does not work at all. my bluetooth keyboard works for a couple of hours and then suddenly stops, i can make the wireless work again by deleting the keyboard drivers and rebooting for it to force reinstall. but same problem occurs after another couple of hours. the laptop keyboard work perfectly fine, and so does other bluetooth devices such as mouse and speakers. i have contacted dell, but they had never heard of this problem before and thought it was very peculiar. he sent me some brand new drivers to install, but it did not fix the problem. has anyone experienced something like it?

for whatever reason, using the integrated graphics is a better experience. i\\'m saving up to buy a new laptop and finally say goodbye to my 6yo old plastic lenovo z55-75 laptop. tech runs pretty damn expensive where i currently live, so once i get someone, i\\'m gonna be stuck with it for years before i can ever manage to replace it. \\u200b i\\'m planning on getting something that\\'s powerful enough to do some photo editing, video editing (2k res at most) and light animation (mostly 2d and frame-by-frame stuff, no 3d) and light gaming on the side. \\u200b while the design and specs go a long way for me, like i said, i need reliability. i understand that with hardware, there\\'s no way to exactly predict if a device is gonna last or not and it varies from device to device and person to person. still, i read a lot of contradicting reviews about xps laptops not lasting more than a year and just randomly dying to a software or hardware issue. i\\'ve ready stuff about battery bloats, chips catching on fire, laptops running hot af, infinite bsods and serious bios issues. not to mention things i hear about most of these problems being caused by the bad or cheap components that are put inside the devices. unfortunately most of these stuff are either too old or too new, so i can\\'t judge if dell has improved the xps models since those days or it\\'s actually going downhill. \\u200b for context, i\\'m having my eyes on the new xps 13 plus. the design doesn\\'t bother me at all and it looks fantastic to me, the size is perfect too. i don\\'t understand why the non-touchscreen options suddenly have vanished into thin air, since personally to me there\\'s nothing more useless than a touchscreen on a laptop. i have sweaty fingers and even using my phone for more than 10 mins is torture to me, so the idea of shilling out an extra 200 usd for a touchscreen that i will absolutely never touch is really annoying to me. \\u200b anyway, can you give out your honest opinions? are the modern xps models (post-2020) genuinely more reliable than whatever the old ones were? or am i gonna shill out 1800 usd just to have the device die on me in a couple of months or by christmas. are there that many driver issues to just effectively cause hardware failure on the device? \\u200b i mean i\\'m running the latest build of win 10 on a 6yo lenovo multimedia laptop with some of the most obscure parts and drivers out there, so i can\\'t imagine there are any worse driver issues out there that i don\\'t already face every single day on this laptop. especially not on an expensive modern premium laptop that ships with win 11 by default. but still, give me the cold hard truth. i\\'ve been using the xps 17 9710 for two weeks now, and here\\'s my thoughts on the same. for reference, here are my specs: i7 11800h, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd, rtx 3050 (60w), 1080p display. if there\\'s anything i can say about this laptop, it has to be the build and design. the hinge is extremely sturdy, and it feels premium to the hand. love the soft carbon fiber layer on the inside, it\\'s very comfortable to rest my hands on. the keyboard itself is absolutely brilliant, and is one of the best on a laptop. even the track pad is excellent. it\\'s big and responsive, and feels much better to use than the ones on my previous laptops. however, there are some qc issues with it, though they seem to disappear when i use my laptop stand (i mostly use it with the stand and hence it isn\\'t a problem for me. i couldn\\'t fix it even if i wanted to, since i bought it in the us and i\\'m now back in india). the overall performance had been phenomenal, and i haven\\'t noticed any lag or other such issues. have played games like gta 5 and some others, and have got upwards of 60fps in most cases at 1080p ultra settings. this is good enough for me as i\\'m a casual gamer, but don\\'t expect it to run at 4k with high settings and high fps. the biggest bonus i felt has been the thermals. i haven\\'t used it at ultra performance, since i haven\\'t needed it, but in any case the cooling has done its job. i previously owned a g3 and i have used an inspiron 16 plus regularly, and both of those run way hotter than the xps. even after a 2 hour gaming session, the gpu temp remained in the mid 60s, and even averaged 58 once with the ac on. it has been a very reliable laptop, and the vapor chamber has been key. i do have two shortcomings, though, which are the camera and the battery life. the camera is even worse than my old 700 dollar g3, which is frankly ridiculous given the price tag of the xps, however i can excuse it because the display is worth having a poor webcam. the battery life isn\\'t bad, but i had expected more than the 5 hrs i get with light browsing and video streaming(50% brightness). overall, i think it\\'s been worth the extra money, given the performance, thermals and the form factor. heck it\\'s smaller than most of the 15 inch laptops i\\'ve used till date (mostly ones with thick bezels and none like the xps 15). if anyone is looking to buy one right now, i\\'d 100% recommend it. if you don\\'t plan on using the extra horsepower, it may even be a better deal than the 9720. you can\\'t really compare the xps 17 to any other laptop, since it\\'s in a marker segment of its own. it\\'s not as bulky as most gaming laptops, and yet it\\'s way more powerful than something like the 17inch lg gram. so in short, its a jack of all trades, which is perfect for someone like me. if you\\'re confused between the 15 and 17, remember: 17 for thermals and power, 15 for slightly more portability. however, i would also say that if you just want performance and don\\'t care about the premium build, there are better alternatives such as the zephyrus line that specialise in demanding tasks such as gaming. even the inspiron 16 plus is worth considering. i installed an nvme ssd that i had in my previous system with the heat shield and i cannot get the system to recognize it even after reseating and updating bios. any ideas? i ordered a dell xps 15 (2022) in switzerland with an internal us/international qwerty backlit keyboard configuration. would that be ansi layout or iso layout? hello everyone, i just got the dell xps 15 9510 in the i9, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd, nvidia 3050 ti and oled display. battery won\\'t be good i am assuming so i want to do a clean windows install. i created the windows 11 installation media download on my thumb drive (from windows website), restarted the computer and spammed f12 until i reached the bios/boot screen. \\u200b issue is when i click on the thumb drive, it cannot find the windows 11 installation media software to do a fresh install of windows. any idea how i can get this to work, or does anybody have a good step by step method to get a fresh install to improve battery life? additionally, what dell drivers/applications should i still have? i heard everything except the dell update software is junk including the max audio software. thanks in advance! notebookcheck have published a review of the 2022 dell xps 15 9520 with a 3.5k oled screen, the i7-12700h cpu and the nvidia geforce rtx 3050 ti graphics https://www.notebookcheck.net/2022-dell-xps-15-9520-3-5k-oled-laptop-review-skip-or-buy.621506.0.html out of curiosity, what are normal cpu temps for the i9-11900h in the xps 9510? i think that hw monitor must not be reading correctly as i regularly see it hitting 100c under very light load (i.e. web browsing). however, machine never feels \"hot\" and i don\\'t notice throttling or anything. i have dell power manager installed and have thermal setting to \"optimized.\" hello, i\\'m trying to decide between buying one of the following: dell xps 17 9710 i9-11980hk, geforce rtx 3060 6gb dell xps 17 9720 i7-12700h, geforce rtx 3050 4gb both with 64gb memory, if that matters. i want what what i buy to be the fastest of the two options, and it\\'s very important for me that it doesn\\'t overheat more than normal because it can get very hot where i live and i don\\'t want it to get risky hot for my computer (but also overheating is annoying in general) i don\\'t care to play games on it, so the main uses i\\'ll have for it that i want to be as good as possible are for programming and for watching movies in as good a resolution as possible without glitches etc. which of these two would be best for me? are there any issues with overheating for 9720? what are your experiences with 9720? i can\\'t seem to find as many reviews on it and i could use some guidance. thanks in advance! edit: i got the newer one (9720) thanks everyone for the advice! hi all, i have a new xps 15 9520 (i7, 64gb, 3050ti, 4k+) running windows 11. i am having issues where with the lid closed for long periods of time (think overnight) the laptop will power off. in the morning, when the lid is opened, the laptop starts as if it\\'s being powered on. everything open when the lid was closed is lost. reading through this subreddit it seems that sleep issues are not uncommon. i have reinstalled the os two different ways, once through mdt with out-of-the-box drivers, and once with the windows media creation tool and using supportassist to reinstall drivers. the end result is the same. has anyone actually been able to fix this issue? this is a test device for a potential small (~20) fleet deployment and i cannot deploy at scale with this issue. \"you can connect up to three 4k external displays or one 5k, or one 8k or higher displays using the usb-c ports available on your xps 15 9510\" does this mean that you can\\'t attach more than three 4k monitors in total, even using docks? if so, it\\'s very disappointing. hi all, bit of a pc beginner here. need some help deciding between these two. my use case is architecture – 3d modelling (sketchup, single-threaded), rendering (twinmotion), drafting (autocad). generally medium scale work so nothing super taxing. appreciate gpu difference might make a difference than i7 vs i9. dell xps 8950 desktop 12th gen core i9-12900k (3.2 to 5.2ghz), rtx™ 3080 lhr, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd @ $2925 aud dell xps 8950 desktop 12th gen core i7-12700 (2.1 to 4.9ghz), rtx™ + 3070 lhr, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd + 1tb 7200rpm sata 6gb/s @ $2190 aud $3k aud was my original budget but happy to save $730 if the real world performance difference between the two is marginal! i\\'m coming across from mac but i\\'m hoping this build will last me 3-5 years (got 6+ years out of my last macbook pro). finally, does the i9-12900k come with a superior cooling system as compared with the i7-12700? cheers for any help! hi guys, i recently got an oled 9510 and so far everything has been perfect but at the back if my mind i have a niggling question. i’ve been reading scare stories regarding burn in especially on the taskbar, so the first thing i did was to set the taskbar to auto hide. am i being over cautious? having an auto hiding taskbar tbh does annoy me 😅 having it bounce up when i dont want it too if i get too close down there. i have a screen saver set to come on after a minute and due to the nature of my work the rest of the screen is always changing, its just that pesky task bar that makes me nervous. what do you guys do? hello everyone, i have an xps 13 plus (9320) on order (16gb ram, 1tb ssd, 4k uhd+ screen, graphite) over the german dell website. it\\'s a replacement unit that was offered and ordered for me by dell technical support, after my 9310 had ram failure on the first day of use. as far as cpu options, only intelcore i7-1260p was available at the time of purchase with a delivery date of 22nd of june. i am planning to use the laptop for university, some coding, light gaming and general day to day stuff (movies etc.). today the website was updated to include the intelcore i7-1280p option. it would arrive roughly two weeks later. how big of a jump is there between the two cpu choices in actual day to day life. is there any significant battery life difference? would it be worth trying to cancel my order and try to ask the technical support person to edit my order in favor of the 1280p or will the 1260p be good enough/the hassle not worth the trouble? thank you very much for any input/advice/help about this topic in advance. i\\'ve been googling for days, but there isn\\'t much info regarding the xps 13 plus out there yet, understandably. basically looking to buy one but there’s like no reviews yet i\\'m looking at a new xps 17 4k 3060, have it in my cart - is that the 9720, given last year\\'s intel 11 gen model was 9710? are dell still using this scheme? does it make any sense? just got my \\'new\\' 9510. everything seems great, except the loose trackpad. a few tips on fixing it: - i roughly followed this method: dell xps 9500 loose touchpad diy fix - youtube - i needed a *lot* more layers of tape stacked up to fix it - i had better success taping in two spots, just toward the center from the left/right buttons, rather than taping only in the middle - it took a *lot* of experimentation to get the number of layers of tape right, and honestly i\\'m still not 100% satisfied, i\\'d maybe even put another layer on the left and possibly take a layer off the right. but it doesn\\'t rattle anymore, which is what matters the most. go into it expecting several rounds of trial and error. - the *only* thing that matters for testing whether you\\'ve fixed it or not is the two screws on the backplate closest to the trackpad. the most efficient way to experiment with tape thickness/layers is to leave the battery completely unscrewed and unplugged and just put back on the case and put in those two screws then check how the trackpad feels. don\\'t waste time putting everything back together only to find out it\\'s not quite right. - this will require putting on/removing the backplate every time, which is a huge pain in the ass. if you\\'re careful, you can only snap in the clips on the front edge close to the trackpad, making it easier to remove for the next attempt. hello everyone i am looking for some first hand experience / recommendations here. i work at a marketing/design agency. we want to replace ancient lenovo thinkpad t510/530s from a decade ago that our project management/copywrite team has been using. they have an i7 630m, 8gb ram and they are barely functional. two years ago we started replacing old imacs of our design team with dell xps 9500 i7 10750h, 1660ti, 16/32gb ram, 1tv ssd, full hd display + wd19tbs docks and some nice 4k/1440p monitors and we love it. the xps 15 is at least as fast as our 2015-2019 imacs and we also love the flexibility the xps 15 gives us regarding work from home, flexible workplaces in the office and such. now i was thinking: why not just get the same laptops (with a smaller ssd and maybe less ram) and docks for the project management and copywrite teams? other, similar laptops, cost at least as much as the dell xps do and cheaper models are pretty trashy pretty quickly (display, keyboard, trackpad, weight, ...) our copywriters and project managers do regularly handle (really) large files in the usual office apps, occasionally evaluate and work in some basic adobe files, work with half a dozen browser tools, outlook, teams etc. i am leaning towards just getting the i7-12700h version with the 3050ti, mostly because the i5-12500h only comes with an integrated intel iris xe graphics and i am sceptical about the performance once 1-2 high res displays are hooked up. is it crazy to buy the i7-12700h version for more or less \"medium office work\"? thank you! hi everyone! with great sadness my xps 13 died this week. i\\'m not sure which year my model is, i\\'ve had it for 6 or 7 years and it has done me really proud! since it was doing such a good job of serving my needs, i\\'m well out of the loop with laptops as i was not considering replacing it. so, i was hoping someone might be able to help me out. i want to replace my xps 13 with another xps 13 but i\\'m not really sure what i should buy. if i\\'m totally honest, i don\\'t actually use my laptop for anything more than using the internet, watching movies and doing some work on it, when i\\'m too lazy to take my work laptop home. i\\'m totally aware i could be getting a more cost effective laptop but i love the brand and model. i don\\'t think i need the highest spec possible. my current xps is.... was .... touchscreen but i don\\'t think i ever used it that much. getting to the point, can anyone give me some tips or suggestions on whether i should opt for an xps 13 or the xps 13 plus and, even more specifically, which spec should i buy? i\\'m seriously tempted by the plus... but.... i have no real reason to buy this other than i really like the look of it! thanks so much in advance for any ideas that you can share with me. fried mother board and waiting for replacement but need my data. the hard drive is soldered to the mb so i can’t do anything with it myself. i only have a few weeks to work with. any suggestions? tia i want to know which one generally would be better for me long term. i like more vibrant screens, so i\\'m tempted for oled but heard of people mentioning; battery performance, screen flickering and image burn as concerns view poll hi, i\\'m looking for a new laptop for compsci university. it\\'s gotta last me 5 years for my whole master\\'s, so i\\'m looking only at the highest-end available models. i have narrowed down my selection to the xps 15 (12700h/3050ti/4k+/32gb/1tb) and 14\" macbook pro (10cpu/16gpu/32gb/1tb). i really like the xps overall and the better serviceability and versatility (windows, linux) make it attractive for me more than airdrop or imessage (i use iphone/airpods). however, i know about all of the issues this line is plagued with. bad trackpads, bad battery life, hot under load, throttling on battery, etc. are there any xps 15 9520 owners who could share their experience with the machine? is it problematic or have these issues been solved? to note, i don\\'t get any configurators in my country except for apple. these machines are fixed spec, some (precision 5x70) lineups are not available at all. thanks a lot it is new out of the box and, it installed all updates, upgraded to win 11 pro, still no audio. i uninstalled waves maxxaudio, uninstalled realtek audio drivers, downloaded and installed new realtek audio drivers from dell website, still no audio. quality control issue at dell needs fixin! ordered the new xps 9520 with the oled screen. received it today and was super stoked to set it up. powered it on, and dell logo popped up, and screen stayed black. noticed the light on the bottom flashing 7 white, 2 amber. time to send it back :( what a damn shame... can\\'t believe they chose such a small battery on the \\'plus\\' model. i received my new shiny xps 15 9520 a few days ago, i spent an entire day setting it for my workflow only to realize that i have got a unit with an issue with the trackpad. i just realized that it randomly stops tracking until i lift my finger and put it back again, it starts tracking just fine. i reached out to dell technical support, she was asking me to update the drivers and stuff, well, i just did clean install windows 11 and installed all the drivers from supportassist, i told her a couple of times that i have already updated the drivers. she kept sending me link for supportassist, i got annoyed and just requested her to guide me for replacement. has anybody gone through the process for the replacement and know how long it may take to receive a new machine? has anyone added a second ssd to the 9520? can you confirm if the speed of both (or either) drives is still gen 4? this seems to indicate that when adding a second, they get downgraded to gen 3 performance (though it isn\\'t clear) i have a 9720, docked to a dell wb22tb4. i have a logi brio camera connected to the dock which supports windows hello. how do i get windows hello to authenticate me from the brio when docked and the built in camera when undocked? tia i have a new shiny new xps 9720 and a wd22tb4 dock, a monitor is connected to dock. all works nominally. the 9720 has a 3060 gpu. i start a steam game, and the geforce widget says the 3060 is running the game (good) but no monitor is connected to the discrete video card. what does that mean? is it a problem? am i limiting performance? i do run both docked and undocked. tia hi everyone, since this morning i have troubles with sound on ubuntu 22.04 lts : - the sound output is not working while plugged on jack - the mic (sound input) is not working while plugged on jack - the internal mic is not working \\u200b on settings, i can see the sound output is kinda receiving something, with the blue lines moving at \"output devices\", but no sound : \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/irr1jqj927191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b933169b118194fa1d12a1012ec8932b0ff4335 the problem is not on my headphones, i\\'ve tried them with an usb sound card, they work fine. do you know how to solve these kind of issues ? hi everyone! i have recently purchased dell xps9720 with 4k display an connected to my philips 279p1 monitor which has integrated docking station. all my devices are connected to monitor out of sight and xps is connecting to monitor usb type-c to usb type-c. monitor has 90w power supply to laptop via usb-c which is not sufficient and laptop is slowly discharging when performing high load tasks. so i connected a standard dell power supply. the problem is that it seem there is no automatic preference for dell power source and sometimes monitor charger is used although both are connected. as workaround i found is to unplug both wires, connect dell power supply first, and then monitor. but after restart it starts charging from monitor again. does anyone know if there is a way to force xps to charge with it\\'s own power supply? \\u200b thank you! whenever i use the xps on battery, and i want to play minecraft, i load it on the igpu to save battery. i\\'ve done it before and it\\'s fine, but this time i forgot to lower the settings beforehand and it froze. 20 seconds later i managed to quit the game and saw that the igpu had reached 93c while that happened, it normally sits at 55c. then the screen started glitching. i have shut it down currently. is it likely to be permanently damaged, or will it be fine after it\\'s cooled down? i don\\'t know how long it was that hot for, but couldn\\'t have been more than a minute. hi, anyone had this problem? when i tray to run heavy load (like compile a program) the cpu seem to lock at 1.5 ghz and half of his power. anyone knows how to solve this? https://preview.redd.it/ky0ckot9w6191.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50d888cb4435a9f18bb8ac2108179fe68eef34f i saw this comment, but it doesn\\'t have solved the problem hello everyone. i purchased a 13 inch xps a little over 1 year ago (so warranty is expired), and it just recently got into a state where it will no longer boot. i did nothing to it, other than let the battery drain to empty over a week or two. cannot even get into the bios. dell logo shows and that\\'s all. the diagnostic code 3,6 is flashing when it boots indicating an incomplete bios flash. i tried disconnecting the battery and draining flea power etc, and i tried to perform a bios recovery flash from a usb stick, but it always then flashes the code for image not found or just doesn\\'t do anything. i thought \"hey maybe i\\'m just doing something stupid\" and took it to a local repair shop to look at it. they had it maybe a couple hours and said there was nothing that they could do to it. they claim the board management engine is shot, and that i should contact dell for an out-of-warranty repair (they also claimed this is a pretty common problem with this line of laptops). has anyone with a 9310 experienced this same problem before? i\\'m loath to contact dell because they\\'ll probably end of wanting to replace the whole motherboard and i know that\\'s going to be $$$. i also still have the option to renew my warranty/support contract for around ~$160 which isn\\'t bad, but there\\'s no guarantee they would honor that (though i would assume this is an issue that would fall under the normal warranty) hello, i have problem with gaming on my xps 15 9510. when i am playing for example overwatch in 4k resolution first 10 minutes i have around 100 fps. but after that it drops to 20 fps. i have found why it happens. memory speed drops 10 times, and memory controller usage increases from 50% to 100% why it happens? and how to fix this. hi, does anyone know when the xps 13 plus will be launched globally? it looks so sick and i want to buy it before i leave for uni in about 2 months. i am living in malaysia. hi guys! dell just delivered my brand new xps 15 (9520) and so far this machine has been a beast! i’ve got a question tho and i can’t seem to find the answer online and that is can i plug in the usbc charger into any of the 3 usbc/thunderbolt ports to charge? or must i specifically use one of the ports as i don’t seem to see a label for power on the chassis. hello, i have recently decided to get a dell xps 17 from bestbuy with the 4k screen and the rtx 3060 since there was a sale, and it looks like a macbook without being a macbook. every other laptop i have used up to this point that is not by apple has had some flaw or disappointment with it. i really like the xps 17 since i managed to get one without the trackpad wobble, coil while, or the other issues i\\'ve heard about them. the only thing i noticed that happened once is, some of the battery drained while plugged in after playing a demanding game for a while, other games did not do this at all. i like it since it is very nice to use, and is basically the best non-apple laptop i\\'ve used. my main issue with apple devices is the gaming aspect of it, i don\\'t play video games much, but sometimes i like to play a game here or there, and a mac makes that very difficult. overall the device is good, however i\\'ve read many different concerning experiences where people had their motherboard go out after like 3 months of use, and that\\'s a bit concerning since i would be using this device for school, so i can\\'t just have my computer break down on me in the middle of the semester. i know people don\\'t really post their positive experiences much, but is this something to worry about? i generally heard that dell was a reliable company up until now. hi all. i have a maxed out 9710. i9 64gb ram 3060, 1 tb. 7 months old. uhd+ original price: ~$3400 has anyone been able to sell theirs? what price? just browsing some local craigslist etc. not even sure if i will get 50 percent back :) hi all, not sure if anyone may have some insight into when the canadian site may offer the xps 13 plus with the 1280p & fhd+ non touch screen? oddly not an option in canada, but i can configure the xps 13 plus as such on the us site. unfortunately the us site will not allow me to ship to canada. \\u200b my question around the 9720 relates to the resolution. as the screen is certainly much larger, i\\'d prefer to go with the fhd+ option if i go the 17\" route instead of 13\" (hate the lack of i/o on the 13\") but was wondering if anyone had any input on fhd+ vs 4k/3.5k? i am using the computer for work, no hugely power intensive tasks. currently using an older xps 13 from 2016 which is getting a little long in the tooth. \\u200b thanks in advance for any helpful tips/suggestions. i am thinking of ordering this years xps 15 and installing a second ssd and exclusively running ubuntu on it. here are the base specs: 12th generation intel® core™ i7-12800h nvidia® geforce rtx™ 3050, 4 gb gddr6, 40 w 15.6\", fhd+ 1920x1200 16 gb, 2 x 8 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz, dual-channel 512 gb, m.2, pcie nvme, ssd \\u200b does anyone on this sub have any experience with running a second ssd and in running linux on a separate drive ? are there any unexpected issues that could come up ? specifically: i know i need to get a heatsink for the new ssd. are there any heating issues that come up assuming i install the heatsink ? is using a second ssd as simple as the steps online to physically install it ? i mean is it automatically detected and ready for use or is some tinkering to be expected ? lastly, are there any issues with running ubuntu on the xps 15 ? i noticed that no xps 15 is listed on the ubuntu certified hardware page. does this matter ? thanks in advance for you help. does anyone know of any effective webcam cover for the xps 9710? seems like the plastic sliding covers would prevent the laptop from closing so wanted to see if anyone has any ideas for a webcam cover. i am thinking to buy xps 15 9520 with i7/32gb ram but have a few questions. i am a developer and run 5-6 docker containers + kubernetes and chrome with 20 tabs and running some golang and node js apps at the same time. some other ides and apps are also open plus terminals. my question is - does xps is a good choice with i7 12700h? does anyone concerned about fan noise or overheating? i checked precision also which is $800 nzd more expensive than xps with the same specs. purchased new december 2021 home use only. overheated once while in sleep mode. restarted and looked like it tried to install bios update but since can’t get to dell screen. was able to run the screen test once and it worked. not again since. since tried everything (removing battery, holding power, etc.) and at most i can get the keyboard backlight to come on. even the front power light doesn’t come on anymore when charging. i don’t hear the fan or any sounds. i really need to recover the data if possible. -can i connect an external monitor and access it that way maybe? -can i run through a series of keyboard shortcuts to perform some kind of bios or system reset (without loosing data). -can i boot from a usb maybe? -can reimagining software allow me to bypass the bios? -sorry if this is dumb but since all the function keys (f2,f12 and so on) have another function. when trying to boot from the start of the machine powering up do i also need to hold the fn key or just f2 for example by itself? tia hey guys! i\\'m thinking of purchasing an xps 15 (9520) for college next year, and i wanted to ask you all a couple questions about it since there aren\\'t too many reviews out there right now for this specific model. how much does the oled screen impact battery life, and how concerned should i be with burn-in? i really like the idea of the better colors that the oled screen provides, and at 15\", i don\\'t see any reason to choose the 4k model over the 3.5k one. i just want to see what some of the downsides of the oled screen are and make my purchase based on that. also, is the i9 model worth it over the i7 one? i\\'m not necessarily asking about if it\\'s worth the price as i don\\'t mind using some scholarship money that i won to buy a nice laptop, but i am curious about how the i9 would impact things such as battery life or thermals. i would be using the laptop to run some engineering software since that\\'s my major, and i\\'m just curious as to if you guys think the i9 would help it perform better with these tasks than an i7 would. thanks! my laptop was delivered on april 27th but i just saw it yesterday as i moved to a different city and one of my friends picked it up. while everything looked fine and operated as expected, i just realized that my trackpad has a little more gap between trackpad and chassis on the left side compared to the right side, i don\\'t like that a lot but i don\\'t see any issues with the way it works, should i be concerned or consider claiming the warranty? only s2idle works, even with setting the kernel parameters to deep sleep. i\\'ve tried to check the bios and whatever else people have tipped about in regards to other models, but nothing works. is the only alternative hibernating into a swap-file? any advice appreciated. currently my battery runs dry dry in idle-mode if it\\'s not plugged in, and i\\'m worried about the wear and tear on the computer. i\\'ve heard that these batteries can go on for month, and recieving this laptop i expected this but have been disappointed when so far the battery dies fully after only a month each. i only use the pen really like once or twice a week for some 5 minute sketches, and really is docked on the magnetic part of the laptop pretty much all the time. not sure what\\'s happening, i don\\'t even have my bluetooth enabled (still works fine, saves battery, didn\\'t need the button functions) so its\\' just not wasting battery on that as well. any suggestions? i got an xps 13 9310 and a dell uhd monitor p2723qe and the uhd blu ray player on dell\\'s website. blu ray player to pc is usc-c thunderbolt whatever it\\'s called. will another usb-c carry uhd video to the monitor ? or do i need a usb-c to hdmi 2.0 converter due to hdcp? my xps 15 9510 doesn\\'t want to auto-switch to the wired lan connection when i attach it to my wd19 dock. it will stay connected to the wifi. if i disconnect the wifi connection or turn off wifi altogether, then the wired connection takes over. i\\'m fairly certain all my drivers are up to date. is there anything i can do about this? hello everyone, i have an xps 13 9310 4k and a 61w usb-c power supply. i have a 24hr certification exam coming up and i would like to use a dock to make it more comfortable as i will need multi windows. will a 61w psu handle this setup? much has been made about the difference in battery life between the fhd panel and the 4k oled panel, but i\\'ve yet to see any numbers detailing the performance of the 4k non-oled screen. i know that a 13 inch screen is rather small, but in my experience there is still a difference, and i am wondering how much of a tradeoff i would really be making in terms of battery life if i went with the 4k option. does anyone know of any place this has been published or have personal experience? i just received my brand new dell xps 9520 | 4k | i7 | 32gb | rtx 3050 ti (45w) delivered in emea region. as a dell xps 9570 4k (2018) previous owner, i can say that the quality control (qc) seems to have improved a lot. first of all, i kept track of all the previous qc issues that occured in the past 2 years with the 2020/2021 xps series as i wanted to buy the previous 11th gen intel ones (wobbly trackpad, case and screen gap when held vertically, fan noise). the one i just received has no wobbly trackpad, hinges problem allowing screen to \"open\" while held vertically nor ununderstandable fan noise while idle or browsing (even the \"in-game\" fan noise, while playing rl, is way more acceptable and chill). cheers. i currently have an m1 macbook air (256ssd, 16gb). it\\'s in fantastic condition and i originally got it for the performance on the go. i ended just watching youtube on it because i could not get used to macos. i prefer windows and i am now learning tons about linux so i want to switch to an intel laptop. i\\'ve been looking around marketplace and i snagged a trade with an xps 13 9310 (i7-1195g7, 512ssd and 16gb) it seems like it is in condition and he still has the box and original accessories. what do you guys think? i saw some people was able to transplant their xps 8940 or 8930, further more like xps 8700 into other pc cases. and i was wondering if i could replace my case of xps 8950. i hear and see that i cant use my psu, and im okay with it. is there a way that i can do? if nzxt 510 case doesnt fit or work, what cases are available for 8950 transplanting? is there any one who tried or succeed, please let me know, thank you hi, i\\'ve ordered a xps 9720, but none of the pens on the dell website look good to me. the premier ones don\\'t show to be compatible either. any recommendations? i\\'m not expecting apple pen quality, but at least something as good as the surface pen? (is the surface pen compatible?) also any other accessories you\\'d all recommend? \\u200b thanks hiya, having issues where if the person closes the lid and re-opens the screen won\\'t come back on. holding the power button for a few seconds then brings up the slide to shutdown option but doesn\\'t actually reboot. happening for a couple of users, dell came out with one but still an issue on both windows 10 and windows 11. has anybody had this before? extreme fan issues? thank you! also wondering if i should wait for them to upgrade the 9310 with 12th gen or not. thanks! it would be great if you could also comment with how long each process took you (roughly)! just curious because not many of these seem to be out there yet. view poll while technically speaking the audio is working for kernels newer than 5.15 for 9510/9710 devices something is not configured correctly. the left side produces distorted audio; like it has the entire frequency range going to the sub-woofer. the right side sounds ok, but it might not be using the woofer. anyone else having this problem? can anyone with the above spec, confirm that windows system shows the same info as mine with hdr enabled: \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/ksmgiu5tttz81.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=87c0ab8fff61a033624ce52333a1b17f0d378455 i am trying to establish if i have a faulty/wrong display fitted, or windows/firmware/driver is reporting the wrong info, or dell\\'s main website specs are wrong. dell suport are not being helpful, and just telling me to return it, and i suspect that the replacement will just be the same. thanks! you can use a y splitter if there is no other fan slot… but i don’t know if there is another plug for the fan. and yes i think fan pump is for water cooling but i‘m not an expert, i might be wrong… my old xps 13 9360 is on it\\'s last leg, and i\\'ve been looking for new laptops for a while now. i\\'m pretty picky though: my basic requirements are 4k to support x2 scaling, no oled, us international which is hard to find where i live and good linux support. that means i\\'m looking very hard at the latest 12 gen xpses as they check most of these boxes. the three options i can get with us international and 4k are the xps 13 plus, xps 15 and xps 17. for xps 15 and 17, i\\'m mostly finding info from the previous gen, so i\\'m curious if there\\'s any notable differences for the 12th gen model. is cooling and performance for the 17 still way better than the 15? do these laptops still suffer from the issue that they can draw power from the battery on peak loads even when plugged in? is that issue only limited to specific configurations? xps 13 plus is the cheapest option and has the \\'benefit\\' of not having an nvidia gpu (which is a pain under linux anyway and i\\'d likely disable it anyway). it probably also has the best linux support out of the bunch having ubuntu as an os option, but it\\'s lack of a full-size sd card slot and especially the audio jack would be annoying. is there any news on how the battery life for these three models compares? any other things to beware of for any of these models (e.g. the wobbly touch pad that was there on previous gens)? anyone here have experience with linux on the xps 15 and 17? what would r/dell recommend? hey. i’m going to be attending a program that will require a bit of design work and computer programming. will this laptop be able to do what i need for classes? i’ll be on the road a lot due to work and school. i need something super light weight since i won’t have time to go home as much. was hoping this would be powerful enough for my needs. thanks. after ordering on march 30th and waiting for a month it finally arrived! perfecly built, no rattle, wobbling, coilwine etc. the i9 stays at 38-42c while browsing and goes up to 60-63c playing forza horizon 5 an staying at 3.8ghz on all cores(i use a cheap laptop pad underneath for gaming) . so far i\\'m pretty impressed and the oled is gorgeous. battery reported 9h streaming video. only grain of salt is bios not allowing to undervolt etc. question for i7 owners: do you have an \"performance\" entry in bios? i am currently using an xps 15 9310 that i purchased from best buy used. it\\'s in amazing condition, had the plastic over the laptop accessories and everything. \\u200b so far i\\'m really enjoying it! i am somewhat interested in the xps 13 plus, and since i\\'m in the return window i\\'m debating on getting a refund and grabbing that. \\u200b my work is fairly simple in regards to power, i record hvac airflow measurements so i basically use excel for data entry ( the workbooks aren\\'t huge like others, but usually has a fair bit of pages for different fans, rooms etc.) as well as simple pdf plan coding. \\u200b when i\\'m on the site to pre order the laptop, the cpu option is confusing for me since i\\'m not the greatest with understanding these things... i want an i7 and 32gb of ram for some future proofing but the 1260 vs 1280 is kind of stumping me. i guarantee i don\\'t need even that much of a processor but wanted to get the communities opinions. \\u200b i just sold my m`1` pro 14\" because mac oc is somewhat harder to integrate with some of the hvac software out there, and mac os version of our cloud storage was kind of trash. touch bar doesn\\'t bother me, headphone jack doesn\\'t bother me, i\\'m hardly needing ports so i feel i may be a decent candidate for this laptop. my computer usually stays on a cart at work so the 15\" doesn\\'t bug me whatsoever but if i wanna use it for other tasks around the house a thin and light seems appealing to me. can anyone share their knowledge on the cpu choice? maybe if they\\'ve downsized from 15 to 13 and how its treated them? hi all, has anyone found a suitable cam slider/cover for the xps 13 9305. didn\\'t buy an expensive laptop to cover the camera with tape. :( adding clarification for those not familiar with the model: there\\'s only 1.5-2 mm space between camera and edge of the lid so the common sliders don\\'t fit. i have a 7590 oled 4k, no problems whatsoever the one of the left side usb port stopped working, it would still deliver power but doesn’t recognize any usb connections . i can randomly get it to work if i use support assist to do usb ports hardware repair, but the issue will reappear after the machine goes to sleep for more than an hour. the other 2 usb ports still work as normal. do you guys think whether is this is hardware of software? i think it might be some window’s power saving bug that causes this. this device has given me tons of headache, i regret buying it even though i got it for a really good deal. there is no reason anyone should buy this at full price. one of the left side usb port stopped working, it would still deliver power but doesn’t recognize any usb connections . i can randomly get it to work if i use support assist to do usb ports hardware repair, but the issue will reappear after the machine goes to sleep for more than an hour. the other 2 usb ports still work as normal. do you guys think whether is this is hardware of software? i think it might be some window’s power saving bug that causes this. i got an xps 17 9710 back in december, ever since getting it, i\\'ve noticed several issues, especially with the cpu running hot. here are the issues: the \"my dell\" app regularly just fails to load at all the laptop idles at 50c, and shoots up to 80-90c when opening programs the fans kick on only once it\\'s been at 100c for like 5 seconds is my laptop defective or is this normal? also, what are my chances of getting a refund or getting it fixed by dell? overall i regret spending the $3200 that i did on it, there\\'s a bunch of issues that make it feel like i didn\\'t get what i paid for. my notebook arrived a few days ago after i brought it to the us and shipped it to hk since the model is not available in hk. i immediately noticed the touchpad is not working normally, seems the right key has been stuck and keeps on freezing unless i touch the monitor. i have no way to use the touchpad at all but could only bring an extra mouse. have asked hk dell for a touchpad replacement since i transferred my warranty to hk but seems a parts shortage makes the delivery time unknown for now. No text content ! i have noticed that the screen gets dimmer and brighter depending on what is being displayed, dimmer on dark display and brighter if the screen is displaying brighter colors. is there a way to disable this? this problem only started very recently within the past 2 days; i\\'ve owned this laptop since november and it\\'s already been sent back to dell once due to some build quality issues. the computer came with a 130 watt charger, but whenever i plug it into any of the usb-c ports i get the windows prompt saying it\\'s charging slowly and to use the charger that came with the laptop. in bios, it\\'s reporting that it\\'s plugged into a 10 watt charger. the problem seemed to go away this afternoon when i borrowed an 85w charger from work and it reported as an 85 watt charger. i then plugged in the oem charger and it worked fine; so it\\'s not the charger. i think it\\'s some sort of software issue since the laptop is clearly capable of charging at 130 watts. i think the problem went away after i left it plugged in all day but turned off and the battery charged up fully; and i think the problem reappeared when i let the laptop go to sleep with the lid closed. battery life is also atrocious right now, it almost seems like the charger is sapping away power, it doesn\\'t even last 2 hours plugged in while i\\'m having this problem. the only major changes i\\'ve made was upgrading to a 2tb nvme drive 2 weeks ago, the system worked fine up until 2 days ago. it has all the latest drivers and bios. edit: the problem seemed to go away after i fully shut down the computer and restarted it. either charger i plug in shows up correctly in bios when i plug it in. now i can\\'t duplicate the problem, i let the computer go to sleep and it woke up fine even after disconnecting and reconnecting either power adapter. i recently bought a xps 15 9510 (i7-11800, 16gb ram, 3050ti) and i keep having problems with it. it randomly gave me a blue screen after a few days and since then it has been freezing multiple times a day. the screen just completely freezes and the only thing that fixes it is holding the power button for ~15 seconds to force turn it off and then restart the laptop. other times when i try to wake it up from sleep it doesnt even turn on and i have to hold the power button multiple times for it to start up. does anyone know any fixes to this problem? hi, i\\'d like to know if is possible to configure the trackpad on a 9310? i want to remove right click from bottom right corner and use two finger click for that, is that possible? i didn\\'t find any bios setting to do it i managed to get a second-hand xps 9510 (i7, 32gb ram, 3050ti, 4k) for $1200. it was bought in february and has barely been used so i still have the 3-year warranty. do any of you consider this a good deal? edit: i forgot to mention, i live in sweden so the price might differentiate to other countries :) yesterday i received my xps 15, and immediately i noticed that the trackpad wasn\\'t working on the windows 11 setup. after completing it with an external mouse, i got the trackpad to work upon loading into windows, but it would stop frequently and skip around the screen. i uninstalled the hid-compliant touchpad driver, to be reinstalled after i restarted the computer. the driver never reappeared but i noticed a problem with the i2c hid device (error 10). i wasn\\'t able to find an official touchpad driver for the xps 9520 on dells website but i\\'ve been fiddling around with others that i could find such as last year\\'s model driver and nothing has solved the issue. i did a clean install of windows 11 and windows 10 (which i\\'m currently using) still to no avail. there are no settings regarding the touchpad in the settings or bios, so i\\'m starting to think it\\'s a hardware issue, but i don\\'t understand if it is why it worked briefly, has any encountered a similar problem? i contacted dell but i would appreciate all the help i could get. i\\'ve done all windows and bios updates, and i have a non-touchscreen model. i just received my xps 15 and noticed the trackpad has a small gap (around 1mm or a bit less) on the left side where it contacts the chassis. it seems like the trackpad isn\\'t centered in its hole in the chassis, leaving a larger gap on the left side and no gap on the right. is this normal? does anyone know where i can find a template for the xps 15 9510 laptop? i see a few sites sell skins, so just wondering if a template is floating around so i can make my own. thanks! so my xps 17 with 3060 and 4k screen arrived... even with light browsing im only getting i\\'d say 3.5~4 hours? still debating if i should return this and go for the 3050ti xps 15 instead with the 2.5k display (middle option) kind of curious on what other people\\'s battery life is like. especially if you have same or similar specced machine. when charging the left-front part of the laptop by the upper corner of the trackpad and lower/middle part of the keyboard get hot. it\\'s not scalding--i can leave my hand there without issue for a minute or more but it\\'s very noticeable. during charging, core temp rises to 60c which is maintained by the computer throughout charging. this is 5-10c over operating temp, but i\\'d guess the keyboard rises about 30f or more in temperature. this makes it uncomfortable to type on/use. i\\'m stuck with the comp due to work. does anyone know how to fix this? hi i changed a noctua cpu cooler for xps 8950. however, i got the cpu fan failure msg after i install the new cpu fan. then i checked the problem is not the new fan, but it is dell issue with their modified 4 pins head. furthermore, i just notice dell dosen\\'t have pwm function even the motherbroad has 4 pins for pwm fan. i used speed fan and tried to control the speed, all the fan speed either 0/ 7xx/ 3xxx full speed rpm. is any method to make it become a normal pwm? can i purchase a pwm fan controller to control cpu fan speed? \\u200b thanks! first of all, i\\'m sorry i haven\\'t shared this earlier :\\'). but i have confirmed with 2 xps models (7590 & 9500 i7 edit: 9510 confirmed too) that this does reduce the overheating issue and also avoids high battery loss during sleep. i haven\\'t done any undervolting or such as i find it a tad bit tedious and i like to keep my bios up to date. this is a utility program called powersettingsexplorer which essentially unlocks the power plan settings that are hidden by dell 🙄. you can download it from the link below: powersettingsexplorer (mediafire.com) https://preview.redd.it/z3bbby96jvy81.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c08372f2d4f81c434937e6ff50eae8c48b5efc21 once opened, you can scroll down to subgroup \\'processor power management\\' and setting \\'processor performance boost mode\\'. by default, dell has both ac & dc power set to aggressive, which is causing the boost clock to function way more than needed. personally, i have changed the dc setting to \\'enabled\\' to allow reasonable boost clocks, however there are other options available if you want to reduce boost regularity. there are a bunch more settings in the program, but i found this was the most important setting to change. and i would not recommend playing with other settings unless you know what its functions are. i hope this helps anyone experiencing overheating issues and it sucks that dell hid this setting and made it hell by defaulting it to \\'aggressive\\'. edit: you also need to click \\'apply\\' on the bottom left to save the changes made. until today, i\\'ve not really listened to any sound on my new xps 15 9520. when i did, there\\'s a clear dominance from the right hand speaker. essentially, there\\'s no bass coming from the lhs of the laptop, but mid and high freq\\'s seem ok. i\\'m guessing the lhs speakers are not functioning correctly, which is somewhat annoying. anyone else experienced this? i found a few threads where people seemed to have something similar, and i\\'m working through them. update: called dell and got through to a very helpful person in malaysia (within 60 seconds!). she asked me to run some diags - all passed with no issues of course. she spoke with second level for a few minutes before offering me a speaker replacement (next business day) or a whole new machine (6-8 weeks). the machine is fine apart from the speaker, so no need for a whole new machine. for those maintaining the list of quality issues to check for when receiving a new xps - here\\'s a new one. hi everyone, this is a very basic question but i\\'ve not had success confirming on dell\\'s website...how do i confirm what battery size (whr) my configuration would receive? the website (regardless of config) indicates that the 86 whr is the battery size, and the notes section says there\\'s multiple options depending on screen type hence my confusion. my configuration of choice is: i7, 3050, 32gb ram, 1tb, fhd screen thank you in advance. i\\'m interested to hear if there are touchpad issues, temperatures and whether suspend / resume works as expected. any distro is of interest... https://imgur.com/a/e7jv0bv just got a brand new dell xps 9520 from dells website, and it arrived with the down arrow key popped out of it\\'s socket (see photos, the little white flap that should be on the bottom is stuck with the key). does anyone know if there\\'s a way for me to put the key back in place, or do i need to get a dell technician to replace the keyboard? also, would i have any luck getting a discount off of my purchase price for the broken key if i get a technician out? anyone who upgraded ssd in dell new xps 15 (9520), is the original ssd installed in the first slot (close to the side of the laptop), or in the second slot (in the center of the laptop)? or is it unpredictable? i\\'m going to add another ssd and need to know asap (preferably in few hours), which heatsink i need to order for additional ssd. thanks! hello everyone so on work downtime ive always played gamepass on my old computer, and now after just receiving and switching to the xps 15 i am having issues with the xbox app detecting any microphone even the built in one. all permissions are set and everything. anyone else seen this issue? all other apps and software detect the microphone except for the xbox app. my xps 17 9710 (32gb, 11800h, 3050) just arrived from costco. i heard the xps line up may have a lot of defects or imperfections, what should i check for? also, i\\'m planning on downgrading windows 11 to a fresh windows 10 install due to 11th gen choice and familiarity. what drivers should i get, or do i even need the drivers?(i heard the dell command update is good). what do i need to be aware of or what are some tips that may help me? the laptop is most commonly going to be used for 4k video editing or mild gaming. just wondering before i waste my money yet again. that noise it makes when you just tap it is soooo annoying for a device that expensive. i was able to get it to a minimum on the 9510 with the electrical tape trick but it makes the button a bit harder to press on one side. hi there. i\\'m trying to determine the easiest way to support two monitors (extended display) for my xps 8950. the chassis has a single displayport. reviews for displayport are less than encouraging. will i need to purchase a different graphics card, or is there an easier way? any help is greatly appreciated. hi all, has anyone hit the semi-infamous trackpad issue for xps 15 9510/9520 and fixed it on linux? this is where the trackpad randomly slows to a crawl for seconds/minutes i clean installed ubuntu and haven\\'t been able to fix it so far thanks i purchased my first dell ever, an xps 13 9310 in early 2021. sometime around june or july, it experienced a partial lcd failure where the bottom portion of the screen would glitch out and be unusable. dell warrantied the lcd and had it replaced for me. fast forward to a week ago, (a month after warranty expiration, naturally) and my lcd failed completely. no display whatsoever. works perfectly fine with external display, but charging led indicates lcd failure with color code (2 amber, 7 white). contacting dell, they refused to do anything for me. they didn\\'t offer anything to remedy, just told me i\\'m out of warranty and too bad (apparently replacement parts get a pitiful 90 day warranty?). i understand the concept of a warranty period, but given the circumstances, i believed some support in good-faith was in order. the lcd failed twice in the span of a year on a \"premium\" product and its my problem now? after talking to a rude and unprofessional dell support supervisor, he simply raised his voice and began yelling at me that \"other brands wouldn\\'t do anything for me\" as i protested that i should be assisted with this. after asking for escalation of my issue, he stated \"someone will call you in a day\" and as i ask for clarification, he hangs up. so far, this has ruined any perception i had for dell, and i will never choose them again. poor reliability, coupled with even worse customer service. they had the chance to have a life-long customer. never again. any help on the matter would he appreciated, as now the shiny laptop i bought for taking notes in class is a shiny paperweight. ): -sorry for the rant! i recently bought a new xps 15 (gen 12 i9) with the oled screen (9520). the screen door effect is noticeable. (for those who don\\'t know, it\\'s like the screen has a very fine mesh overlay, which looks like miniscule dots, like a very fine screen door.) it is not horrible, but it is very annoying. it is less noticeable the farther away i am but my eyes aren\\'t getting younger so i need to be closer every day. do i get used to it? sort of, but not enough for it to disappear. and i write a lot so i am frequently looking at a white page (the dreaded expanse of white page...) and that\\'s when it is most noticeable. however, it is also noticeable against any lighter colors. it\\'s just plain annoying. and i\\'m annoyed at myself for not uncovering the screen door issue prior to purchase, but hoped that it wouldn\\'t be an issue once i got it. my decision was partly driven by availability--i need something asap and the 4k screen isn\\'t available in my preferred config until june or july (thanks supply chain). part of my annoyance stems from the fact that the screen otherwise is pretty darn good. contrast is awesome, brightness is awesome (better than the mac book pro 16\" m1 imo), and it is just a pleasure in many ways. i also like the touch screen aspect. therein of course lies the rub because it is my understanding that the touchscreen is actually the issue to blame for the screen door effect. so the dell is going back. i purchased a macbook pro 16\" m1 pro instead. i\\'m os agnostic and was pleasantly surprised by many aspects of the dell, but my last 2 windows laptops have become overheating laggy messes at almost exactly the one year point and my last macbook lasted 10 years. the xps 15\\'s fan is already very active and the thing gets warm with only light browsing. i don\\'t have much to report about battery life, but in the short time i\\'ve had the xps 15, i\\'ve noticed the battery drains quicker than i\\'d like. if you can live with the battery life, then i say go with the uhd screen. i\\'d also suggest 32mb of ram, but it\\'s nice to know that\\'s user replaceable, so maybe get 16 for now based on avaibility and wait for the ram prices to come down. (btw, i recommend 32mb ram for the mb, too, despite what all the reviews say. moar ram ftw!) tl;dr: new xps 15 oled (9520) suffers from screen door effect. it is a first world problem, but still a problem especially for such a pricey \\'puter. go for the uhd if you can wait. are you going to install bare-metal linux on it? if yes you should go for 9310 instead of 9305 if you care about support for fingerprint. i do not know where 9320 stands. if dell has in business line store the ubuntu variant of this model (developer edition) then it should be fully supported. i got 9305 but now i wish i got 9310 or xps 15 instead not just because of screen but also larger trackpad. hello all, i picked up a dell xps 13 9305 less than a month ago. i decided to be cheap (of course i did!) and didn\\'t pick up a good hardshell case and a new bag with a handle, just using my old chromebook bag that it fit in. as such, like a fool, i dropped it this morning inside the case onto hard stone tile. of course, i got a dent right on the edge of the top lid. since i\\'ve purchased it so recently, i still have the option of buying premium support plus which includes accidental damage for $180 + tax. this seems cheaper than buying a new entire top assembly from ebay, even though i can do the repair myself - and the ebay parts are not as good as what i\\'ve got, which is glossy + touch ips fhd. that said, maybe there\\'s suppliers i haven\\'t found yet? i checked laptopscreen.com which is my go-to, but they had no stock of any 9305 display assemblies. also, will the accidental damage coverage included in premium support plus even cover strictly cosmetic damage? or do i need to... uh... break it a little more... entirely on accident..? i ordered an xps 17 9710, but i\\'m having second thoughts. reviews keep saying that the 12th gen intel processors are a huge improvement over 11th gen. i briefly tried an xps 15 9510 last year, but the oled had the screen door effect and it got quite warm. given the heat and fan noise of most thin creator/gaming laptops, i\\'m looking to get something with vapor chamber cooling. for anyone who has had both the 9710 and 9720, is there any noticeable performance improvement in the new model? namely, speed, battery life, speaker quality, gaming smoothness. the 9710 was $550 cheaper than the \"comparable\" 9720. i\\'m also looking at the msi z16p which has a 16\" qhd touchscreen at 165 hz, vapor chamber cooling, 12th gen i7, comes with an rtx 3070 ti or 3080, rgb keyboard, a usb a port, and similar speaker configuration for nearly the same price. it also has a sturdy metal build but not quite as premium in look and feel as the xps. also, it has a 90 whr battery instead of 97, and comes with a 240 w charger, which with those specs likely will drain battery faster. any input would be greatly appreciated. i recently bought a new xps 15 (gen 12 i9) with the oled screen (9520). the screen door effect is noticeable.

(btw i have a 4 year extended warranty). let me know you guys thoughts. should i sell the laptop and get a different brand? i bought a new xps15 9510 (configured with 32gb of ram) in february of 2022 and quickly realized i wished i had gone with 64 gb (i am a video editor). anyhow, i just upgraded, and want to sell the 2x16 gb ram. dm me if interested. hey everyone! a few days ago i ordered the base configuration of xps 9520 (i5, 16gb ram, 512 ssd, w/o dgpu, 56whr battery, 90w charger). xps have always been my dream laptops and i\\'ve been wanting to get one for more than 6 years now, so i\\'m really happy it\\'s finally happening! anyway - i am looking into upgrading my charging setup to accommodate the new laptop and ideally have single charger (and powerbank) for everything. from what i\\'ve seen, it used to be that the laptop could not be charged with a third party charger that was supplying less than 65w, and those that were supplying more were just limited to supply only 65w. i think i also saw something that those limitations might\\'ve been dropped in the latest generations of the xps. could anyone who already got their xps 9520 (preferably the one without dgpu) try to see if it charges with 30w, 45w, 60w, 65w and 100w pd chargers (or whatever other power you might have at hand)? i know the lower-power chargers won\\'t allow the laptop to run at full speed, but as the idle/light productivity power draw is apparently ~25w, i\\'d prefer to take a smaller charger with me on the go. thanks for the help! i bought an xps 9560 about 6 months ago from my friend and love it. i\\'m thinking about upgrading to the latest model. is it worth it? ik the 9560 came out in 2017 so after 4/5 years is the upgrade worth it? i understand that this is only just starting to appear in stores, but i\\'m seriously keen on getting this device and i\\'m just curious as to people\\'s current thoughts and predictions. my main concern is the display. i\\'m coming from a 13-inch surface book (3000x2000, 267 ppi), so the xps fhd (1920x1200, 169 ppi) feels like a serious downgrade. i love consuming media on my laptop, so the oled (3456x2160, 304 ppi) seems like a decent, though pricey, upgrade. i was worried about how badly the battery life would be hit, but i was watching dave2d\\'s review of the xps 13 plus and on a light load, he got 9h 42min on the oled, and 11h 16min on the fhd. am i the only one who is surprised by the battery life on the oled? from the way some people used to talk about oled laptops, it was as if the battery life would drop by half. but this is just a ~13% reduction, which seems pretty good to me for an oled display. what are everyone\\'s thoughts on the battery life of the xps 13 plus oled version? (of course, i understand that battery life varies wildly depending on people\\'s usages... for my part, 70% of the time i\\'m working with pdfs on edge, word, and perhaps youtube/spotify in the background. this probably counts as a light load. i currently use dark mode on every possible program - doing the same with an oled should help the battery life, right?) is it possible to passthrough another video out into the xps in order to use it as a regular display? i know older models have been able to do this. so i thought i\\'d mention this because i had no idea you could do this... i registered for dell rewards before buying the 9720 and got 3% back in rewards after the purchase. i wasn\\'t sure what to do with the extra cash since i didn\\'t really need any accessories and even if i did, dell is generally overpriced for most things. then, because it was within 30 days of the purchase date, i was able to use the rewards to tack on an extra year of warranty + accidental damage protection at almost 0 extra cost out of pocket. so make sure you register for the rewards even if there\\'s nothing you need. you can use them on warranty add-ons. edit: forgot to add, rewards expire after 90 days. hi guys, brand new dell owner here and long time lurker for the last few months deciding whether to go do dell or lenovo, heheh well you probably can guess my decision 😁 i’m a veteran it guy so hope i can help you guys out in the future. having used apple mac’s for a long time and still using my 10 year old 15” macbook pro, although now looking very crusty i’ve got myself a 9510 oled win 11 and so far i’m in love, no issues at all but that’s what i’d expect for a week old machine. over the years how long has it been until you’ve had to replace yours? are there any other serious niggling issues i should know about other than wobbly mouse pads i keep reading about 😕 should i expect another 10 years with my 9510? im receiving my replacement trackpad and mothetboard from dell in the comming days. trackpad - gets stuck when clicking and random lags. motherboard - gpu watage drops to 20-30w, dell diagnostics tool reported pci bus failure. if you had those parts replaced did it fix your problem? hey everyone! a few days ago i ordered the base configuration of xps 9520 (i5, 16gb ram, 512 ssd, w/o dgpu, 56whr battery, 90w charger). xps have always been my dream laptops and i\\'ve been wanting to get one for more than 6 years now, so i\\'m really happy it\\'s finally happening! anyway - i am looking into upgrading my charging setup to accommodate the new laptop and ideally have single charger (and powerbank) for everything. from what i\\'ve seen, it used to be that the laptop could not be charged with a third party charger that was supplying less than 65w, and those that were supplying more were just limited to supply only 65w. i think i also saw something that those limitations might\\'ve been dropped in the latest generations of the xps. could anyone who already got their xps 9520 (preferably the one without dgpu) try to see if it charges with 30w, 45w, 60w, 65w and 100w pd chargers (or whatever other power you might have at hand)?

i am curious to know if the newer ones that came after the 9500 still suffer from a wobbly track pad. i guess they\\'ll be considered the 2021 and 2022 models? i didn\\'t know how to search on here so i decided to ask the question. sorry if this has already been asked. i do not get on this subreddit very much. side question: does anyone know how to lower fan speed or know why the fan kicks in like crazy when watching videos? any idea why this happens? is it a known issue? i have updated all drivers and bios hey guys! recently ordered the brand new xps 15 9520 model and am very excited for it! i happened to chance upon this subreddit and found that many of you recommend performing a clean installation of windows for my machine to work better. if anyone is kind enough i’ve got a few questions how significant is the performance gained when a brand new installation of windows is performed? if so would windows 10 be better than windows 11 for a clean install? if i were to install windows 10 would my product key that came with my laptop activate windows 10 and how do i find this product key? does performing a fresh windows install void any warranty? and finally dell has a list of drivers made for the dell xps 9520 but they seem to indicate only for windows 11. has anyone tried downloading them on windows 10 and do these drivers work the same for windows 10? i appreciate any help from everyone and thank you for your time! i\\'m monitoring my gpu clocks temps and wattage during games and im getting massive massive fps drops. when that happens my gpu wattage drops from around 60w to lower than 30w. is there any explantion or fix for it? i bought clear case just to protect xps 9710 when i stowed in my bag. i bought it from amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/b09ftkq8v2?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_anjdnxwcvwnwggvjyd34 hey, i was wondering in which direction does the xps 15 9520 dissipate heat. do the fans dissipate it upwards, from the side, from the back towards your legs, or what. i tried searching for some diagrams or something that show the airflow, but i couldn\\'t find anything. thanks in advance! hello everyone, just picked up an xps 9510 from bestbuy recently. everything seems to be fine except the trackpad. it doesn\\'t feel wobbly or anything but it just randomly stops tracking from time to time and i have to lift my finger off, give it a couple seconds then it starts working again. anyone else experience this? wondering if this is a software or hardware issue in which case i should get it replaced at bestbuy while i can? i am running windows 11 at the moment just got my xps 9520 in the mail today (finally after ordering on april 3d)! i was hoping to clean install windows today, however, for the life of me, i cannot seem to boot from usb (formatted with windows media creation tool). i have disabled secure boot, enabled boot from thunderbolt, and have changed from fastboot to thorough. if anyone was able to successfully install, or had similar issues, would love to hear. thanks! update: i was able to access the usb as a boot drive through manually adding the pathway as a boot option. however, now running into an issue with not detecting the ssd in the creation tool... just ran cinebench on my xps 15 9520 with intel 12th gen i7-12700h, 64gb ddr5 ram (although doesn\\'t matter in this case as this is a cpu benchmark) multi core result: 12,426 single core result: 1,686 i compared the results here and saw higher scores than apple m1 pro, max + ultra (in single core test). currently have a dell xps 9510 (w/ dgpu nvidia 3050 ti) win 11, connected to a dell wd22tb4 dock and 2 external monitors @ wuxga resolutions, laptop display is @ uhd+ unfortunately, the desktop response (clicking on an windows item) lags by a couple seconds. laptop, bios and drivers all up-to-date and docking station fw up-to-date. unplugging dock, everything responds fine on laptop display. anyone experience something similar or have any advice on troubleshooting? i have a dock that outputs 100w power over usb-c. i know that the xps 15 9510 with a gpu technically wants 130w but as i\\'m usually not using the gpu i don\\'t think it can realistically draw more than 100w. however, i\\'m still seeing the warning about the slow charger. i\\'m wondering if it will still throttle cpu performance even if the total power draw stays within those 100w. has anyone ever had a similar situation and looked more deeply into what the system is doing? just ran cinebench on my xps 15 9520 with intel 12th gen i7-12700h, 64gb ddr5 ram (although doesn\\'t matter in this case as this is a cpu benchmark) multi core result: 12,426 single core result: 1,686 i compared the results here and saw higher scores than apple m1 pro, max + ultra (in single core test). this is unsurprising, considering it\\'s dell we\\'re talking about. but i just wanted folks to know because when i first ordered, the 1260p was the best processor you could select - it was either that or the i5. but today i went back to the site to check something out and noticed there were now 3 processor options, and sure enough, now configuring one with the 1280p comes out to the exact total i was charged for the same spec\\'d 1260p i ordered on the 28th. if you\\'re fine with the 1260p, then if you reorder now it should be $100 cheaper. my initial ship date was by june 20th, and the new one is the 24th, so i think it\\'s well worth it for anyone in the market for this to cancel and reorder. also, i assume if you\\'re buying you know to use the code 100off1499, and on that note, if anyone knows of a better code, please post! also, anyone who\\'s bought a dell product upon release before: do you think we\\'ll really be waiting til late june for these to ship? i have no idea, this is my 4th xps but first \"day one\" purchase. i was using my xps 15 and i left to go do something. i come back and i tried to use the trackpad and the mouse on the screen was not moving. the only thing it was doing was it was registering clicks that i was making. does anyone know how this can be fixed? hi guys, i bought a new xps 9305 and i am loving using it. however, i have noticed that the laptop goes into hibernation after i leave the laptop in sleep for a period around an hour or longer. is there an in-built setting in dell laptops that does this? i am completely lost on this one. thanks in advance!! when will i be able to order the new xps 9520 from amazon? i dell.com does not take orders from outside the us :( is it only resellers that are selling on amazon? hey guys, i have a xps 9310 that has 2 thunderbolt ports, i have a da310 hub that i\\'m using to my fhd monitor, but can i connect my other type-c 4k monitor to the other thunderbolt port and have both monitors working? thanks i would like to buy extra fans for these models but for some reason, my google fu is failing me hi all, could you please help me decide which configuration should i take after as replacement unit ? dell offered me these two devices which specs are bellow in table: \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/244srcjps0x81.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffd17ccd710b3a4f685b62693904bdc1a28823c5 hi! i am looking to buy an xps 15. i am a cs student, i will run linux on it, and need something that will last for many years. i found 2 brand new xps 15 laptops for a similar price, but i\\'m not sure which is the better deal. note: both laptops have the same screen resolution choice #1: xps 15 9500 10th generation intel® core™ i7-10875h (16 mb cache, 8 cores, 16 threads, 2.30 ghz to 5.10 ghz) nvidia® geforce® gtx 1650 ti 4gb gddr6 16 gb, 2 x 8 gb, ddr4, 2933 mhz, dual-channel 512 gb, m.2, pcie nvme, ssd \\u200b choice #2: xps 15 9520 12th generation intel® core™ i5-12500h (18mb cache, up to 4.5 ghz, 12 cores) intel® iris® xe graphics 16 gb, 2 x 8 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz, dual-channel 512 gb, m.2, pcie nvme, ssd \\u200b what\\'s stopping me from buying the 9520 is that the 9500 has a more powerful gpu, but i don\\'t know if that makes it a better laptop overall. any advice is appreciated! so, i am curious, the new xps 13 plus, is just great all around, but does it support pen input, for digital note taking and art purposes, if it does, it\\'s just the best possible option, there can be for me. thanks in advance. https://www.google.com/search?q=xps+9710+vs+9700&rlz=1cdgoyi_enus913us913&oq=9710+vs+9700&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i22i30j0i390l4.3819j0j4&hl=en-us&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=utf-8 hi everybody, i\\'m curious to get an opinion from other users. i want to get a new laptop for work/gaming. the budget is around 2000€ and i spent a lot of hours watching reviews on any kind of laptop. my requirements are: - able to do my job as software developer (and with this budget is not a problem on any laptop) - able to play game: i want to be able to play elden ring at 60 fps on low/medium and i don\\'t need anything more than that - i usually work in café and various office so i need something light (max around 2 kg) now.. i love the design of the xps 9510. it\\'s simple and clean, it doesn\\'t have a proprietary charge connector, it doesn\\'t have a numpad so the keyboard is nice and simmetric, it looks professional. the outside is amazing but i\\'m worried about the rest, i read a lot of article here and i don\\'t now if people are cherry picking problems or is an awful machine. so... should i get a 9510? or there is some other suggestions? they configuration that i would take is: i7 - 3050ti - 16gb ram - 500gb memory (ram and memory that i\\'ll update in the future) thanks for the help! don\\'t use your iphone charger to charge your laptop. i make heavy use of virtualization, but it isn\\'t enabled on xps 9720, or so i was told by customer service. i\\'m worried buying it will cripple virtual box. are there people who already have this machine and can report their experience with virtualization technology? note: precision have vpro, but the other specs are inferior. so i am not enthusiastic about buying the latter either. i recently purchased the new 9520, it\\'s still in production, probs won\\'t get it for another month. my question is this, i am constantly seeing posts about stuff not working on brand new xps\\', and the advice is to typically reinstall the drivers from dell blah blah blah. why are these problems occuring? and how big of a problem is this? are we just seeing an insanely small percentage of people buying the computers? are these problems likely to occur or are they pretty rare? i\\'ve tried reinstalling the intel smart sound technology for mipi soundwire audio driver, restarting, etc. nothing works. \\u200b anybody have any solutions? google searches aren\\'t helping me. hi everyone, \\u200b so i\\'m a graphic designer student and i bought a few months ago a brand new dell xps 15 9510 with the 3,5k oled screen for my work. i didn\\'t have any problems at first excpet overheating, loud fans and low battery life but i think that\\'s the case for every xps. after a few weeks, i noticed that the colors were a bit off and way too oversaturated but i thought it was no big deal and calibrate the screen would fix it. but now i tried litteraly everything to fix that and it\\'s becoming impossible to use this computer for school work (graphic design), also i have recently experienced a ram issue with the adobe suite and particulary with photoshop (wich is my main software), tried to unistall and didn\\'t solve, i have to use a pirated version to work now... so yeah, very disapointed with a 2000 euros device, and i please ask you guys on what should i do, is it possible to ask for a refund or an exchange? thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english :\\') how do i buy one? it looks like none are available until june? no. just installed 64gb ddr5 on my xps 15 9520. see pic above. also does anyone know what that word (guessing mandarin?) means? i have been trying to install scrivener using wine but it wouldn\\'t work. someone on the pop subreddit said there\\'s some issue with the driver for the graphics card. and indeed, ever since installing pop several months ago (starting with 20.04), the pop shop (software centre) has always listed 2: nvidia-driver-470 and nvidia-driver-510. after installing one, it lists the other one as an update that needs installing. this hasn\\'t caused a problem before, but when i try to launch scrivener nothing happens and i get this: mesa-intel: warning: performance support disabled, consider sysctl dev.i915.perf_stream_paranoid=0 0068:err:ntoskrnl:zwloaddriver failed to create driver l\"\\\\\\\\registry\\\\\\\\machine\\\\\\\\system\\\\\\\\currentcontrolset\\\\\\\\services\\\\\\\\nsiproxy\": c0000003 mesa-intel: warning: performance support disabled, consider sysctl dev.i915.perf_stream_paranoid=0 00b8:err:winediag:secur32_initntlmsp ntlm_auth was not found or is outdated. make sure that ntlm_auth >= 3.0.25 is in your path. usually, you can find it in the winbind package of your distribution. x error of failed request: badvalue (integer parameter out of range for operation) major opcode of failed request: 152 (glx) minor opcode of failed request: 3 (x_glxcreatecontext) value in failed request: 0x0 serial number of failed request: 207 current serial number in output stream: 208 and if i run $ glxgears i get: x error of failed request: badvalue (integer parameter out of range for operation) major opcode of failed request: 152 (glx) minor opcode of failed request: 3 (x_glxcreatecontext) value in failed request: 0x0 serial number of failed request: 28 current serial number in output stream: 29 any ideas how i can get scrivener running? i\\'m curious to find out if someone has actually done this...and if it is real. unfortunately, dell stopped allowing wifi module upgrades in xps laptops...they solder them now. i read that you might be able to use the 2nd m.2 slot to install a wifi module. i\\'m fine now but if i wanted to upgrade from wifi 6 to 6e module, does this work...i.e. has anyone done it and can confirm it works? dave 2d review is also out on it. i think it looks super clean but not sure about its functionality. i\\'m still waiting if they release a non-plus version. https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-plus-laptop/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop i received notification that my notebook shipped early on 4/28, got assigned a service tag and warranty and fedex two day tracking number from chicago. however, even as of today on the tracking number fedex is reporting that they got the shipment info/label created on 4/24. no other info is on there, no arrival date or progress any ideas on whats happening? i would of expected the computer yesterday, today, or monday, but the lack of tracking info confuses me. will there be an xps 13 version without the touch bar? who does want fake keys anyways? in my opinion, the xps 13 plus is a big minus... first background, i have a firm budget of $2500 usd to get a laptop. my main use case is a laptop to use at work (i am a grad student in a stem field) mostly running basic programs (office suite, adobe illustrator/ photoshop/ web browsing). i also will sometimes have large microscopy files (ram intensive). i will also use the laptop for personal stuff such as adobe program based photo editing on the go (no video editing) and other normal stuff people use laptops for (no gaming). i have a solid personal desktop set up at home i use for gaming and editing as well and it is also what i have been using for ram intensive tasks. my question is would i be better served by the 17\" 9720 with 12500h/ intel xe/ uhd+ screen or with an 15\" 9520 with 12700h/ 3050ti/ uhd+ screen? (i have to order through my institution and these are the best specs that stay under $2500, for some reason their prices are worse than consumer prices...) the only pace where i see the dgpu in the 9520 mattering is maybe in adobe programs with gpu acceleration but i am not sure that offsets the larger amount of screen real-estate of the 9720. i also realize i will not gain the advantage of vapor chamber cooling without he dgpu in the 9720- is that a worthwhile tradeoff? i don\\'t see any other places where i will personally notice a difference in my use case- is this a correct assumption? i will also plan on upgrading the ram of either machine to 32gb at least. other questions are just making sure (based on dell\\'s info i assume this is the case) that the battery in the 9720 is the 97wh battery regardless of processor? \\u200b anything else i may be missing please point it out. thank you!! that\\'s a relative question, and what is the price? it\\'s being phased out for the xps 13 plus. i played around with the configurator and there are limited build options. for instance, you cannot select a fhd screen anymore, probably because they are being allocated 13 plus production. as such, looks like the cheapest 13 plus available is the i3/8/256/4k configuration, and that\\'s $1,250. yikes. i managed to get my 9310 last year and was able to use a coupon to get the i5/16/512/1200p configuration for the price of the base model, $999. so unless you can get a deal, i\\'d steer toward a 13 plus. i wanted to do the trade in but the value is so low, it makes no sense. where is the best place to sell pristine dell laptops? was it really necessary to remove the headphone jack though? hi everyone, \\u200b i just got dell xps 9720 with 4k touch screen. this is my first dell xps. here are my first impressions: \\u200b it\\'s noticeably heavy, but slim. it still fits for the 15\\'laptop bag i haven\\'t yet tested how long the battery will last, but from full discharge to to charge it took 110 minutes i haven\\'t performed clean installation and i\\'m using windows 11 with all dell apps. from the start system was noticeably lagging, especially when playing videos. youtube needed couple of second to load and audio started before video...after installing all new drivers (especially nvidia drivers) system started run smoothly. screen is great, but out of the box too vivid, on red\\'s were eye burning. dell premiercolor helped, but it needs run all the time in the background and while it\\'s not loaded on the startup vivid colors are back. i have run userbenchamark . here are the results: userbenchmarks: game 66%, desk 106%, work 72% cpu: intel core i7-12700h - 99.2% gpu: nvidia geforce rtx 3050 laptop gpu - 58.2% ssd: nvme pc sn810 wdc 1024gb - 394.7% ram: unknown hmcg88mebsa092n 2x31.5gb - 154.7% mbd: dell xps 17 9720 while running benchmark laptop fans kicked in , but not unbearably hot. gpu temperature was 55c. \\u200b this is everything i could share at them moment. i plan to test battery life next week to see how long it lasts works if you know any free tool for the benchmark please share in comments. hello everyone, i want to order the new 9520, but there\\'s a time constraint; it must be delivered before 26th of may. it is non negotiable because i\\'m having someone bring it to me from the us. going by the stories of others on this sub, the situation seems dire. i will be starting university this fall and need a laptop really bad. the prices in my country are 160%+ that of the us, and only shitty configs are available. any advice? thanks. currently own an xps 7590 and a samsung 49\" ultra wide. my current laptop is limited with video out due to it routing video signal through the intel graphics card despite the nvidia card, thus limited to sdr 5120x1440 60hz through usb c to display port v1.4. i\\'m trying to figure out if the 9520 with the 12th gen intel will support the monitor at 5k hdr 120hz. my wife\\'s $1600 m1 laptop has better video out support than my \"for creators\" $3500 laptop... i don’t use facebook. can you provide the dell.com link for this xps offer? i\\'m looking for people from canada who bought new xps 15 9520. did anyone receive the order? please, specify configuration, date of order, shipping, expected and actual (if any) delivery. here\\'s mine: \\u200b configuration: i7/32gb ram/512 ssd/oled/3050ti ordered: march 27th shipped: april 6th expected delivery: april 11th present (april 28th): not even picked up by purolator revised delivery: may 6th \\u200b i understand all shutdowns/lockdowns/bla-bla-bla issues, but my problem is that dell starts counting 12 months warranty period from the date they marked the order \"shipped\". i\\'m losing at least (in the best scenario, considering there are no additional delays) one month of the warranty. i spoke to dell customers care supervisor and they refuse to extend the warranty period or provide any compensation. basically, dell is robbing customers like me, because the cost of the warranty is embedded in the price of the laptop. is there any legal way (in canada) to force dell to extend the warranty (this is not cheap, over $3.5k, purchase)? \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/t4qrbyvv7ew81.jpg?width=1652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a6698a6b373d8f0bb7dd098a0f44392d1f74286 intel chip(left) and nvidia chip(right) after removing the heat sink according to dell\\'s service manual, there are two heat sink pipes, and two fans inside xps 15(9500, 9510, 9520) does anyone know whether xps without nvidia chip have the same cooling system as you can see above? or just one fan & smaller heat spread as the square area for dgpu on the right side would be empty i just got my xps 17 in the mail, it currently has a 1tb ssd installed, i would love to add a 2nd ssd with 2tb of storage to it does anybody know what kind would make the most sense to buy? wondering if there is room for a heatsink as well. i\\'ve got my eye on a samsung 970 evo plus any advice would be appreciated!! what is up with that garbage bluetooth? is anyone else having problems? the range is like 5ft for my sony wh-1000xm3 headset and maybe 1-2ft for my razer mouse. is the issue with windows 11? the laptop itself? i just got a mouse replacement thinking it was because of it and it\\'s the same. i\\'ve updated all drivers, reinstalled some of them, tried a bunch of registry fixes, etc but it\\'s still extremely bad compared to my 9560. what is up with that garbage bluetooth? is anyone else having problems? the range is like 5ft for my sony wh-1000xm3 headset and maybe 1-2ft for my razer mouse. is the issue with windows 11? the laptop itself? i just got a mouse replacement thinking it was because of it and it\\'s the same. i\\'ve updated all drivers, reinstalled some of them, tried a bunch of registry fixes, etc but it\\'s still extremely bad compared to my 9560. i broke the connector which says kb fpc... there\\'s a ribbon cable that goes from the keyboard base to the motherboard, that ribbon cable goes to this (broken) connector. anybody know what the exact name of this ribbon cable connector is? could it be some kind of molex fpc ? i just got xps 15 9510 and im willing to buy a decent dock. i am looking into getting an xps 15 9520 at work. i work in it and have been given a big budget for my new laptop but i am limited to dell only. my workplace is still using a windows 10 image and 11 won\\'t be ready for a while. i see that there is no windows 10 enterprise driver package for the xps 15 9520 as of right now. has anyone with a new 9520 installed windows 10? i just want to make sure there are no issues. thank you. i have a 9310 that i got just before christmas. really love this computer, however it has one issue that really annoys me. when i\\'m watching netflix thru bluetooth headphones, the audio drops as if the connection is severed for a couple seconds then picks back up. this happens probably every minute or two. the headphones have no issues with any other device, in fact i even had them replaced under warranty in case they were the issue and still nothing. is there a way to fix this? is this a common issue? cheers just got my new xps 15 with a 3050 card and am trying to run oculus but it says the card is incompatible. oculus says they are working on adding support but that was posted back in feb. has anyone seen this issue or heard of any updates? i chatted with a dell representative this morning for my order estimated to ship today because i was really worried that dell would not make it due to the lockdown in shanghai and all the supply chain problems- and i really need the machine to be delivered in the next two weeks. the representative told me that the xps 9520 i ordered was \\'ready to ship\\' and this meant the machine was already in the u.s. i know it very well that dell reps don\\'t always tell the true story. can anyone verify if this is true or at least you\\'ve heard about this \\'ready to ship\\' before? update: received tracking 4/26 tracking updated as picked up 4/27 eta 4/28. it seems that the dell representative told the true story. my xps arrived 4 days earlier than the original 5/2 delivery date. hey everyone! so i bought a xps 8950 and neglected to see it only had one display port and no hdmi ports (i got the intel uhd 770). can anyone suggest the best way to hookup dual monitors to this desktop?? any help would be appreciate, thank you! solved: i was able to daisy chain the monitors and extended display works with that. i ordered the laptop on 3/30, and the order was confirmed and the build process started very quickly. my original arrival date was 4/15. however, there have been delays in getting my laptop. dell has marked the laptop as \"shipped\", so the money has been taken from my account and my return window has started, but the laptop has not actually been shipped yet. the first time i contacted dell was on a customer support chat a couple days after my estimated arrival date of 4/15, on 4/17. i just was curious as to the status of my shipment, and the advisor told me that it was going to arrive the next day. i asked how and if there was any kind of tracking number i could have so that i could ensure that i\\'d be home when it got delivered, and he said there was nothing he could share since it was all dell internal information. obviously, it did not arrive the next day. when that happened, i reached out to customer support for a second time late on monday night, to let them know what happened, that i was disappointed that i was not told the truth, and for the status of my order. the agent i was with that night said that he was not sure, but would elevate my case. i gave them my phone number and email, and was told that i would hear from someone within 24-48 hours. that did not happen. after this, i was starting to get fairly frustrated, and tried a different outlet of communication, the @dellcares twitter account. this was on wednesday evening. again, they told me that i would hear back from them on the status of my order within 24-48 hours. once again, i heard nothing from them within their timeframe, and only did a few hours ago. i understand that that twitter handle does not reply on weekend hours, but the entirety of my 48-hour period was during the week. i did get some more information, that my laptop was still at their asian facility, and that in 1-2 business days, i would get another update. i then asked if i was eligible for any compensation for my delay, since it was already up to a week and a half and my laptop was still in asia. i also heard of other people on this subreddit getting some compensation from dell for orders that were running significantly late. i said that i was disappointed, was moving in ~2 weeks, and was upset that my estimated arrival date was so off. i also mentioned that the money was already taken from my account and my return window has been ticking down for weeks. i was basically told to fuck off, and that the delivery dates were not promised. which i understand, but delays of what will ultimately be at least a couple weeks is insane, especially since they marked the order as shipped, took my money, and this is eating into my return window. i am really disappointed at how dell treats their customers, and have been thoroughly upset at how this has been handled. the wrong delivery date is one thing, but to be constantly lied to by dell representatives and for there to still be no real delivery date close to 2 weeks later is immensely disappointing. does anyone have any suggestions on what i can do to help myself out and get this all resolved? i understand that things are tough for dell with what is going on in shanghai at the moment, but i also don\\'t think i am being unreasonable to be upset as a customer. so this recently started happening and im not sure why... i have an asus zenscreen (https://www.asus.com/ca-en/displays-desktops/monitors/zenscreen/zenscreen-mb16ac/) that gets powered via a usb-c port, it also transmits/receives data using the same cable so only one cable is required to power and connect it to a laptop. a few weeks ago the mointor suddenly stopped working, i thought it was broken but i tested the same monitor on another laptop and desktop using a usb-c port and it worked fine on them. now for the weird part, if i connect the monitor to my desktop or my other laptop via usb-c and then quickly unplug and plug it into the xps 9710, it works! if i wait a few seconds and plug it into the xps 9710, it does not work... i tried reinstall windows 11 and 10 and downgrading to various firmware and testing out various settings but nothing seems to help. the usb-c port works for other devices like a usb-c ethernet adapter and usb c drive. it doesnt seem to be a software issue or a firmware issue as i\\'ve tried all the firmwares. could it be a hardware issue even though the usb-c ports do work with other devices? does anyone know where to purchase as a part? i unfortunately took my laptop outside the usa so a complex technician assistance directly from dell is not doable here hi all. i bought a xps 9510 and i love it. my only problem is i want to run two additional monitors for gaming. the 9510 has three usb c ports. i need one for power and a second for my steering wheel because the wheel can\\'t go through a hub. this leaves me with one usb c for a hub. my current hub will only do one hdmi @ 30hz but also has a power pass-through of 85 watts. the problem with this is my ac adapter is 125 watts. i think my laptop is using power faster than the 85 watt hub can provide. otherwise i could do this configuration and have a free usb c for a 60hz hdmi adapter. i need a hub that has at least one hdmi 60hz port and one hdmi/display port 30hz or 60hz port. does anyone have any experience with this? know of any good hubs that will do this? thanks in advance! i ordered the laptop on 3/30, and the order was confirmed and the build process started very quickly. my original arrival date was 4/15. however, there have been delays in getting my laptop. dell has marked the laptop as \"shipped\", so the money has been taken from my account and my return window has started, but the laptop has not actually been shipped yet. the first time i contacted dell was on a customer support chat a couple days after my estimated arrival date of 4/15, on 4/17. i just was curious as to the status of my shipment, and the advisor told me that it was going to arrive the next day. i asked how and if there was any kind of tracking number i could have so that i could ensure that i\\'d be home when it got delivered, and he said there was nothing he could share since it was all dell internal information. obviously, it did not arrive the next day. when that happened, i reached out to customer support for a second time late on monday night, to let them know what happened, that i was disappointed that i was not told the truth, and for the status of my order. the agent i was with that night said that he was not sure, but would elevate my case. i gave them my phone number and email, and was told that i would hear from someone within 24-48 hours. that did not happen. after this, i was starting to get fairly frustrated, and tried a different outlet of communication, the @dellcares twitter account. this was on wednesday evening. again, they told me that i would hear back from them on the status of my order within 24-48 hours. once again, i heard nothing from them within their timeframe, and only did a few hours ago. i understand that that twitter handle does not reply on weekend hours, but the entirety of my 48-hour period was during the week. i did get some more information, that my laptop was still at their asian facility, and that in 1-2 business days, i would get another update. i then asked if i was eligible for any compensation for my delay, since it was already up to a week and a half and my laptop was still in asia. i also heard of other people on this subreddit getting some compensation from dell for orders that were running significantly late. i said that i was disappointed, was moving in ~2 weeks, and was upset that my estimated arrival date was so off. i also mentioned that the money was already taken from my account and my return window has been ticking down for weeks. i was basically told to fuck off, and that the delivery dates were not promised. which i understand, but delays of what will ultimately be at least a couple weeks is insane, especially since they marked the order as shipped, took my money, and this is eating into my return window. i am really disappointed at how dell treats their customers, and have been thoroughly upset at how this has been handled. the wrong delivery date is one thing, but to be constantly lied to by dell representatives and for there to still be no real delivery date close to 2 weeks later is immensely disappointing. does anyone have any suggestions on what i can do to help myself out and get this all resolved?

or sometimes when the pc starts to throttle or stop working ( windows issues) the fan just remains wild for like a minute till the windows issues are fixed. i do not like the stock cpu fan cooler, i did a little search for a after market cooler, and all i was seeing was noctua u9s and vetroo v5. i don\\'t know much about cooler but i know those two coolers have different sizes. noctua is 92mm fan and the veteoo v5 is 120mm fan cooler. which one is the correct cooler for xps 8950? or is there any other good fan cooler rather than those? posting here in case anyone else with an xps 9710 (or possibly other xps\\'s) who once had an undervolt working, then it stopped, is looking for info on how to re-enable. first, you\\'ve had to follow the guide here to get familiar with the process and all the steps: https://brendangreenley.com/undervolting-2020-dell-laptops-like-the-vostro-7500-and-more-tips-to-improve-thermals-battery-life-and-speed/ that worked for me, and then something happened. maybe my bios updated, or something else, but it got locked and i couldn\\'t figure it out. at some point the variables changed from displaying \\'0x0\\' to \\'0x00\\' and that\\'s when i couldn\\'t undervolt/use throttlestop. downgrading the bios to various versions did nothing. while i searched for a solution, i actually came across an extra beneficial solution which i\\'m currently still using, which is to bring down my turbo ratios in an attempt to reduce thermal temps. you lose out on a bit of performance, but the reduced heat when under steady loads makes up for it by avoiding throttling. anyway, then i came across this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/xps/comments/sh02yr/undervolting_my_9510_11800h_with_windows_11_and/ the op posted about an additional variable i hadn\\'t touched, an \\' overclocking feature \\'. i ran this command in grub to enable it. grub> setup_var cpusetup 0x135 0x1 booted up; boom it works! running my undervolt again. fair warning: i have no idea the impacts adjusting this variable has. i literally just read what that op stated and copied it to my system. i happened to have the same variable names (i checked, using the first link\\'s guide), so if you will want to make sure you check what your variables are first. i seem to have found that an -80mv runs fine in some limited stress tests, anything more and i crash. i left the cpu cache and system agent and igpu at normal. i know on my 12900k, cpu cache adjustments don\\'t seem to add any value, but that\\'s alder lake, so i\\'m not sure if tiger lake (the xps 9170\\'s 11800h processor) is the same or not. other things i\\'ve done that may have also affected: disabled virtualization in my bios, and currently running bios version 1.5.3 for the xps 9710. i haven\\'t checked if i can upgrade to the latest bios and still use the undervolt because i don\\'t want to risk anything. i just red on the internet that intel gen 12 is pretty much worse then gen 11 due to battery life time. i ordered 9520 and just asking myself if this wasn\\'t better to order 9510. any experiences? the laptop was on standby and when i tried to start it up again the screen didn\\'t turn on and the fans were going at full speed (while the keyboard was lit up). therefore i manually turned it off and now every time i try to start it again it gets stuck on the dell logo and the battery light starts to flicker. can anyone please help me? it happened at a very bad time, i have a deadline on tuesday. the laptop was on standby and when i tried to start it up again the screen didn\\'t turn on and the fans were going at full speed (while the keyboard was lit up). therefore i manually turned it off and now every time i try to start it again it gets stuck on the dell logo and the battery light starts to flicker. can anyone please help me? it happened at a very bad time, i have a deadline on tuesday. is there any program for windows that can control the fans on the dell xps 17 9710? i know about the various tools on linux, and i was wondering if there are similar tools for windows? i\\'ve installed throttlestop to limit the cpu power so it doesn\\'t run at 90c when opening programs, but because the fans come on stupidly late, i\\'m having to limit the power more than i\\'d like. being able to adjust the fans in windows would be good. how does the battery life of 9500/9510 hold up over time? as far as i know, 9520 should have the same battery. i found somewhere that the battery is rated for only 300 cycles, which is not much. with my current xps (9560) the battery life dropped pretty quicky, now it only lasts about an hour. how is your battery life now after a year or two of use? thanks just ordered my new 9520. i\\'m super stoked. i7, 16 gigs of ram, 1tb, rtx 3050. the wait time is gonna suck! should i get the fhd or the 4k screen? does the 4k screen make a big difference? hi, i\\'ll start by saying that my faith in my dell xps 9510 is so low. i am really disappointed with the purchase, and wish i\\'d picked a lenovo instead, and i\\'ll not be buying a dell again after this. the wifi is god awful. disconnects randomly, and is a common problem with the 9510 and there doesn\\'t seem to be a solution. some people, including dell, suggest changing your router, but frankly that is not a solution - this is a laptop that needs to be portable and i should be able to connect to the wifi wherever i go! i use ubuntu and there is some really bad trackpad lag. again, a common problem with no solution yet (that i\\'ve found...) so if you\\'re looking to buy this laptop, don\\'t; go pick yourself out a decent laptop from lenovo. now, my question: what resolution do you guys use on your dell xps 9510? in ubuntu, i\\'m using 1920 x 1200 (16:10) and scale 100% but it just doesn\\'t feel right on the eyes and feels a little blurry. i\\'m not sure if it\\'s just in my head. in windows, i am using a much higher resolution and 250% scale factor and that just doesn\\'t seem right either! i guess i\\'ll not buy a laptop with 16:10 ratio again, it even causes problems when i connect to my external monitor. edit: my screen is 15.6\" uhd+ (3840 x 2400) infinityedge touch anti-reflecitve 500-nit display. the reason i use 1920 x 1200 on ubuntu is because i have this weird problem where some apps open with really tiny icons, and i think this is to do with the scaling (again, i think scaling is ~ 200% when i run that high resolution in ubuntu) \\u200b edit2: here is an image of the tiny icons in pinta when i set the higher resolution of 3840 x 2400 (screen does look better i must admit!) https://imgur.com/zl5xeme im looking to buy i9 intel xps 8950 tower however ive seen reports that the cooling is not good on the xps however i wont be pushing the computer to its limits as i wont be gaming on the pc maybe football manager i will be using the computer for trading so web browsing, trading software would the cooling not matter as i wont be doing heavy load work?? hey guys, just ordered my first xps 13. it comes with fhd+ screen and i7 1195g7. however, after looking on reddit, i’ve seen so many bad things about them that i’m thinking about cancelling my order. if you’ve been using the 9310, i would love to hear your experience with the device. btw, with the i7 1195g7, can i expect good battery life ? thanks ! hey i bought my \"friend\" an xps 13 9305 as a christmas gift last year, as she desperately needed new laptop for med school. overall she is very happy with her laptop, had an update issue that seems to have resolved... but one ongoing issue she seems to be having is with its audio playback. on headphones audio is perfectly fine, but whenever the audio is coming through the speakers, it glitches out, and creates a feedback sound. this only happens on video playback, and only when the audio is coming out of the laptops speakers. anyone else have this issue with their laptop, or know a solution? so i seem to be running into a serious shipping delay with my dell xps 15 (9520) order. it was placed on 3/31, shipped from asia on 4/13 and is still in transit to the us. is this typical? i know there is a covid surge in that part of the world but plenty of posters on this thread seem to have gotten theirs in a much shorter time frame than mine. hello everybody, i bought a dell xps 9510 with a 4k screen months ago. since this day, everytime i used the laptop my eyes are hurting and i have eyestrain. even for short use. in addition to the really bad color accuracy of the screen even after using a calibration device, i am in a situation in which i do not use the xps... do any of you experience the same? i searched a lot about this issue and something that can cause that is named \"pwm\" of the screen but apparently the display of the dell xps 9510 don\\'t have this problem. i\\'m really considering selling it. thanks a lot 🙏 only on the business side, but if you purchase it with a credit card it shouldn\\'t matter... save $330 cad: https://www.dell.com/en-ca/work/shop/laptops-ultrabooks/new-xps-17/spd/xps-17-9720-laptop/ctox17w11p1c4002ca?view=configurations hello, i would like to buy a new pc for programming and some machine learning student courses. i\\'ve arrieved at a conclusion to buy dell xps 9510 since it has great display, is relatively small and has somewhat powerful gpu.since than i was searching for common issues with this device and found about the following:- wobbly touchpad- issue with a display when pluging external monitor- issues with fast battery drain with light usage (many people suggest to reinstall windows)- issues with drivers on ubuntu linux (i will be definietly installing it as a dualboot. i think that appropriate drivers should exist by now) the device that i will buy comes from the dell outlet, but is sold by 3rd reseller, not from dell site, since the dell doesn\\'t have such service in poland. when it comes to the device it has the following specs: i7-11800h 16gb ddr4 3200mhz rtx 3050ti 4gb gddr6 2 x 512 gb ssd 15,6\\'\\' fhd+ i asked the seller to provide me with a service tag of such device. i\\'ve checked the dell pro warranty, and it is valid till the end of october, which is a bummer, but still seems not too bad. i know that the warranty needs to be passed onto my name for it to be valid for this pc. seller told me that it won\\'t be a problem. is there anything else that i should keep in mind when buying this device? can i search for repair history on dell website for this device, or check how much the battery is used? when i had tried to reach dell support, they said that they can\\'t give me that infromation if i\\'m not an owner of this device. the device costs around 1830 euro. thanks a lot for your help. is anyone planning to upgrade ubuntu right away? is the hardware fully supported? some people may be familiar with an issue of a dell xps, usually brand new, having the initial dell logo and bios settings (hit f2 on boot) appear just fine with proper backlight and brightness, but as soon as windows loads it\\'s almost completely black like the image. only way to see the screen is a flashlight. brightness keys/adaptive brightness/closing lid don\\'t do anything in order to fix this issue, you need to make a registry edit (and you\\'ll likely need to do this part with a flashlight shined on the screen). hit the start key and type \"regedit\" and hit enter (must be local admin). then navigate carefully to the entry below: hkey_local_machine\\\\system\\\\controlset001\\\\control\\\\class{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\\\0001 the last folder may not be 0001, it could be 0000 or 0002. but one of those folders should have an entry for \"featuretestcontrol\". modify the value in this entry to dword value \"00008a1\" after that\\'s done, reboot your computer and the screen should now work i found this solution from a hard to find dell support thread here (thanks dell-nathalia and iterable) and it worked for my dell xps 15 9510. before this, the solution was to send the unit back to dell for repairs, which can obviously take a while and leaves you without a device. hopefully this fix works for you i got my dell xps 15 9510 2 months ago and it was working great out of the box. now i have to use my laptop within arms reach of an outlet. i\\'m lucky to get 1.5 hours battery life out of my xps, even with closing power hungry applications, turning the screen brightness low, setting the power mode to balanced, etc... my laptop always runs hot, even when closed. when i pull it out of my backpack after leaving it in there for 30 minutes, the fans are on high and the laptop is hot. the only thing i\\'ve changed about my laptop out of the box was adding an extra ssd and doing a fresh install of windows. anyone else have a similar issue or suggestions on how to fix this? really bummed about this since i paid a pretty penny for the laptop. i\\'m planning to buy xps 15 9520. but i have some worry that maybe unreal engine 5 won\\'t run well on it. i\\'m a game developer, which use unreal engine and most of my work is graphics programming. so i think i should have laptop what has more powerful gpu, but the design, great 4k display and high build quality of the xps keep me thinking of buying it. also, i won\\'t do all works only on laptop because i already have desktop. if i buy xps 9520, i will upgrade cpu and ram to i9 and 32gb or 64gb. can i get some opinion or advice? since a couple of weeks ago, whenever i try to use my xps 13 9310 in my bed or any place that isnt my desk (where it is completely flat and not moving), the laptop’s display randomly and suddenly starts to freeze. it is first partial and then complete, but music still keeps playing. i havent dropped it or done anything tl cause physical damage to any parts. i have had lt for a round 1 year and it has just recently begun to act like this. i habe tried troubleshooting some of the components but no luck yet. any ideas? so i have an xps 9510 and i bent the case a little and now the trackpad doesn\\'t click as well on one side is there anything i can do about this, best i can think is a new bottom case will straighten everything out but what is the availability of those? hi reditters! do you think this usb c hub by anker is compatible with xps 13 9305? https://imgur.com/a/2bnevyy https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/b07yz48hct/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_3z9pfbqtwgscr6fmd1fw thanks in advance! so i’ve had the brand new dell xps 9720 specs i7-12700h 3840x2400 32gb 4800mhz sodimm ddr5 512gb nvme class 3 by kioxia upgraded ssd to 2x(1tb samsung 980 pro nvme 4.0 ssd) so the issues i’ve been having is mainly to do with spportassist os recovery i’ve been going back-and-forth with dell and i cannot get the laptop to download the recovery iso so i can reinstall windows but no matter what i do it will not pull the file we’ve tried my personal hotspot my blank vlans on my network and nothing dell’s solution is to ship me a drive with windows 11 pro and we’re going to give that a shot when it arrives but overall i’ve been disappointed in this xps it’s a little heavy but i expected that the aluminum was poorly cleaned off of production there was a little cnc lubricant residue in the sdxc slot otherwise the laptop is beautiful build quality is really good and despite the way it is a good on the go desktop like laptop with enough performance to code and video edit on the go this is a premium product and it shows the only things i ask dell is to fix your recovery os app so that i don’t have to get shipping bootable media from dell. hi reditters! do you think this usb c hub by anker is compatible with xps 13 9305? https://imgur.com/a/2bnevyy https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/b07yz48hct/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_3z9pfbqtwgscr6fmd1fw thanks in advance! just ordered a xps 9520 - i7 12th gen - 32gb - 1tb - 3050ti 45w - uhd 4k. expect 1 month+ delay from purchase in emea region. my estimated delivery is on may 30th. important to notice especially if you need a computer asap. hi all, i received my new xps15 - 9520 two weeks ago and just installed a 2nd ssd (crucial p5 2tb m2). i wanted to give everyone a heads up that dell is no longer including the 2nd ssd heatsink cover. on my past xps systems the cover was installed on the 2nd slot even if you didnt order a 2nd ssd. i had to order one off amazon to be able to install the additional ssd. i was a little bummed out about this as i had the new ssd ready and tore the system down to install only to find i didnt have the heatsink cover i needed. so if you plan to add a 2nd ssd make sure you order the heatsink cover before tackling the install! the install was super easy and took about 15 mins once i had all the required parts and the new ssd is working great and i have plenty of space for all my vm\\'s now! cwb xps 15 - 9520 - i9 12900hk, 32 gb, 3050 w/ oled, 512 / 2tb ssd fyi for those who were waiting for it... the rtx 3060 model (and by extension, the i9) is now online (on the canadian site at least). i\\'m quite surprised they limited the 3060 to 60w this year, making the extra $250 cad they charge seem like a so-so value (vs the also-60w 3050). that\\'s speaking as someone who doesn\\'t really use it much for gaming though... maybe it\\'s worth it to those who game more. https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-17-laptop/spd/xps-17-9720-laptop/nxps179720_s4e did some benchmark tests on my new xps 15 9520 - i9-12900hk, 32gb ram, 3050 gpu (oled), 512 gb ssd, 2tb ssd... i am pretty happy with the results for a medium form factor laptop.... tests were done set to \"best performance\" and with the oem 130w power supply. system fans did kick on during the tests but remained very quite... had to put my ear up to keyboard to hear them! 79th percentile for the world! https://claytonbanka-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/p/cbanka/ecmvpfzfetraghxacaypzoqbk5hdps8-fxmp2qunf0qula?e=lolcfr ever since i\\'ve bought this computer i\\'ve been having issues. the first day i had it i downloaded a 3d software program for school and it damn near broke my computer somehow. ended up doing a factory reset to basically start over, when i started setting it up i flat out could not open the settings menu. i was on the phone with dell support for 3 hours, they ended up fixing the issue. nice. fast forward to one day after my 30-day return policy expired (you see where this is going?), every time the computer would go to sleep it would not turn back on unless you hold down the power button. i ended up fixing this issue by updating the gpu driver that was labeled \"urgent\". nice. two days later, the problem came back so i went to the tech support yet again. they ended up fixing the issue by downloading another \"urgent\" bios driver. weird that i somehow missed that the first time. today, a couple days after the last issue, the computer freezes and my cursor ends up disappearing. nice. i restarted it, no luck. tried a troubleshooting test, ended up canceling it bc it took way too long. shut down the computer, cursor is back? not a big issue but a minor inconvenience in the moment. i called dell to see if they have any leniency on their return policy, they do not. but supposedly they have a 3 tech support rule where they\\'ll look into your unit and deem if it is defective or not and give you a new one? or that\\'s how i interpreted that. found myself in the review section of the xps 15, i see 10+ issues all stating my same problem, computer goes into sleep mode and will not turn back on. i guess what this whole story is about is, has anyone had this issue and got it fixed? and has it came back since you got it fixed? appreciate it. hi everyone, i got an xps 9510 that came with windows 11 pre-installed, and every now and then my bluetooth mouse stops working because the bluetooth thingy in the toolbar literally vanishes. has anybody had a similar problem? update: replacement has been confirmed. i was initially worried they were going to spec it with a 12th gen i5 which would have meant marginal improvements in a bigger form factor. i also didn\\'t realize the new i7 was such a big step up from the 11th gen. i\\'m satisfied. it\\'s been a long warranty process but they\\'ve been consistently helpful and ultimately made it right. now updated with specs i have an xps 9305 with an i7-1165g7 and 16gb of ram that dell was unable to repair. there is no exact replacement available so they have offered me an xps 9520 instead. i looks like a meaningful improvement in performance, but comes at the cost of ultralight portability. i am waiting on them to confirm the exact specifications, but presuming they offer an equivalent cpu, ram, hd and so on, would you take this offer?

is the lower number the charging current when on a non dell charger? but that would be around 90w, which is more than the 65w i\\'ve read about. are both the numbers for dell chargers? if they are, why not just have the 6.5a rating? the fact there\\'s 2 current ratings would seem to indicate that the lower one is for when it\\'s connected to non dell chargers? can the dell xps 17 9710 charge with 65w or 90w when connected to a non dell usb pd charger? i have an xps 17 9710 i just got, and while the trackpad didn\\'t wobble, i did notice that it seemed to miss 60% of my left-clicks for some reason. i am not sure if this will fix everyone\\'s issues, but there is an elan firmware update for the trackpad from dell\\'s support/drivers page. running this elan firmware update fixed 90% of my issues with missed clicks. hope this helps! https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=t95y2&oscode=wt64a&productcode=xps-17-9710-laptop hello i\\'m looking to buy xps 9510 with i9, rtx 3050ti. i am a casual game player. i only play league of legends or overwatch. what i am curious about is how much framerate i can expect when playing overwatch by connecting a laptop with that specification to an external monitor that supports 144hz. another thing i\\'m curious about is how i can connect my laptop to a monitor. thank you so much ! i use my laptop for a lot of excel, powerbi, rpa systems, databases, sql, visual studio for coding python - have it hooked up to dell\\'s docking station to display two external monitors (34\\' and 24\\'). i currently have surface laptop 3: intel i5-1035g7 cpu @ 1.2ghz 1.50ghz/ 8gb ram / 128gb storage not having too much issues, but fans always running quite hard and can hear it a lot, sometimes excel crashes from having too many running etc. looking to get dell xps 13 9305: 11th gen intel i7-1165g7 cpu @ 4.70 ghz turbo / 16gb ram / 512gb storage wondering if xps 13 would be strong enough to use comfortably. additionally - are the active pens any good? wanting to use the laptop screen for note taking like a tablet while using it hooked up to monitors. prices it\\'s originally valued au$2,098.99 but is on sales at $1,573.99, then with my work discount 7% it\\'d be $1,463.81 and i get $100 in coupon, which i can use it to buy a pen. wondering if this price is good to take now, or would waiting until end of financial year be better, unsure how much discount you get then. i recently got a dell xps 9305 and i was under the impression that only one of the ports is used for charging (primary charging port is what they call it), but then i plugged my laptop in one of the others and it charges just fine. is there some benefit of using the main port or drawback of not using it? i currently have an xps 9560 and tried to get a skin in the past, which covers the dell logo, but couldn\\'t find any, so i just gave up. i\\'m now looking to upgrade to a 9520. my question is, whether you know about some skin options, which do cover the dell logo? xps 9500/9510 and 9520 should be the same. dbrand has some special edition skins which seem to do it, but other than that i haven\\'t managed to find any options. thanks in particular, is it fully compatible with the samsung 980 pro ssd 1tb -m.2 pcie 4.0 nvme? i have a dell xps 9710 but am struggling to adapt to the larger wrist panel size and large trackpad. i previously had a 14\" laptop and my wrist would hover over the front edge of the laptop. however because of the very large trackpad and keyboard being more towards the back of the xps 17 my forearms now rest on the edge. this is rather uncomfortable and the edges cut into my form arm which hurts it. i need a wrist rest that can i can lie on top to protect my forearms. either cover the bottom half of the trackpad or need two separate ones, one on either side of the trackpad. something like this https://www.amazon.com/wavepads-aquues-solutions-non-slip-ergonomic/dp/b08qz6kcrg/ https://www.amazon.com/grifiti-notebook-silicone-reposition-travelling/dp/b00cmj1s8a \\u200b \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/1c7mc79ncnt81.jpg?width=438&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b374f30c47504a789564bccf8e0492f8fbde640 No text content ! so i am studying cyber security at university and have been looking at getting a dell xps 13 for work coding and things and for entertainment films nextflix n so on but i’m really confused on the models and which is best to get out of the 9305 and the 9310 which one is the newest one and which is better on a normal ish budget also when i look on the dell website and go on the 9305 model is let’s me change the specs on it but when i go on the 9310 for the 13 it doesn’t let me change them so it forces 8gig of ram and a i5 any advice appreciated! my uhd 9500 is in repair right now and i saw a very good deal on a fhd 9510 (with dgpu). can i put the uhd screen on the 9510 once i get my 9500 back? sometimes my system is really unresponsive, even though none of the resources (cpu, ram, disk) are peaked out. i have the feeling this became worse lately, but i\\'ve never really been happy with the performance of the xps since the beginning. i found out, that the cpu speed really frequently falls down to about 1ghz for no apparent reason. according to core temp my cpu cores are running at at around 55-60°c and almost never get over that. no wonder, as the cpu is throttled as hell. i was of the opinion, that the system should use as many resources as available when plugged in having temps far below critical. of course it should use as little resources as necessary, but as long as everything is in the green, it should throw as much power at every task when required. it can happen that while on a video call in teams and trying to write notes in onenote, i get seconds of delay between the key stroke and the actual character appearing on the screen. this is unbearable. i tried using throttlestop, to stop the throttling from happening, but it doesn\\'t seem to have an effect on my system. the db prochot setting is enabled, i read somewhere this should solve the issue. in the power settings the power mode is set to \"best performance\", the dell power profile is enabled, in the dell power manager the fan speed is set to optimized. any hints what i can to do get rid of this problem? hello guys. how well the 9310 (i7-1185g7) performs under intensive single core tasks? does it heat too much? should there be air blowing upwards from the right side of the touchpad? i am concerned about this i recently bought the xps 15 9520 (12th gen intel cpu). i chose windows 11 pro as os. but when reading throught the internet and reddit i found out it is better to do a clean install just to get rid off add ons and application from dell. is it really necessary to do a clean install of windows? what will happen to the windows 11 pro i get from dell? hi guys, i could be interested about one of these models but sadly it seems that every major tech youtuber or tech media are still under dell\\'s nda. any idea when we could expect detailled reviews of these two laptops online ? thanks a lot ! it\\'s still early days for my xps 15 9520, but i\\'m very pleased with it so far. it\\'s an i7, 32gb, 1tb, 3050, oled model. i\\'ve been using it on battery, plugged into the included charger, and powered via a caldigit thunderbolt 3 dock. when docked, file transfers between my desktop and the xps, both on the same 10gbe network, have hit 1gb/s, and 800-900mb/s most of the time. so far, i\\'ve not heard any noise from the xps on battery or charger, even with heavy installs like adobe creative suite and doing some lightroom cataloging. no noticeable heat, either. battery life is ok: with a mixed use of some lightroom, photoshop, and email, battery life has been around 4-6 hours. your mileage, i\\'m sure, will vary. performance is snappy, even on applications that are usually slow to launch. photoshop takes 8 seconds, the same time that it takes on my threadripper 3970x with a pcie optane 905p primary drive. i\\'m also happy to report that there\\'s been not one crash, glitch, or weirdness, except for constant usermodepowerservice events 12 in the system log, which don\\'t seem to have any bad effect. i\\'m still guessing that these are a feature of the alder lake power management, but am curious if anyone else is seeing them? my laptop has been locked by bitlocker recovery and i don\\'t have the key. dell support had me replace the motherboard but when the technician came to replace it, he stated that it wouldn\\'t fix the issue and he was right. he said i need to replace the ssd to fully remove bitlocker but dell support says otherwise. does anyone know what part the bitlocker is physically housed in so i can argue with more confidence? thanks ;) \\u200b p.s. i have an xps 15 9510 i\\'m looking for some more information for deciding to go with the 3.5k oled or 4k uhd+ lcd display with the xps 15 9520. i\\'m mainly looking about information and experiences with the following: what is the oled subpixel layout? regular rgb stripe, diamond, pentile or something else? is it 2 or 3 subpixels per pixel? any close up pictures? how is battery life on the 9520? compared to the 9510? any differences between the 3.5k oled and 4k lcd (at similar brightness)? burn-in is now pretty much unnoticeable right? if you have any experiences or information sources, i would love to hear them! hi all, i\\'m ready to pull the trigger on an xps 15, but am still undecided on which screen to pick up or which gpu. i would estimate 70% of the this laptops life will be connected to a larger display via egpu with the laptop display disabled. the other 30% will be most video streaming with some light gaming. based on the light gaming use case, is there a large difference in the response time on the fhd vs oled? i have seen some reviews stating that there is noticeable ghosting in gaming on the oled, but if the fhd display is a similar response time, its kind of irrelevant. i do typically prefer the glossy displays over the anti glare as i\\'ll just move the screen to avoid glare if needed. i have no intention of using the touch screen on purpose, so that feature isn\\'t a factor. my second question is deciding between the 3050 vs 3050ti when undocked from the egpu. i know there isnt a large performance difference between the two, so i\\'m more looking to reduce heat with the selection. will the 40w 3050 always run cooler than the 45w 3050ti, or would the 3050ti run cooler if i was capping fps in games at 60? what if i want a dell xps 13 with the power of the 12th gen intel chips but without the new design of the xps 13 plus 9320 which has a weird trackpad and no headphone jack? i also feel like the glass wrist rest would not be nearly as comfortable as the carbon fiber one. i ordered a new xps 15 9520 on apr. 7 and just checked today, it said build complete on the order status page. however, the shipping date is still apr. 27 and estimated arrival date may 2. would dell ship this earlier than the estimated date usually? just think it doesn\\'t make sense for it to take almost two weeks to ship. it has been a month since 9520 is released, but a white interior still does not show up as an option... i know that xps laptops are usually better, but it’s a (\"low tier“) xps 13 9305 and a (pretty \"high tier\") inspiron 15 plus. specs: inspiron 15 plus: intel® core™ i5-11400h, 8gb ram, geforce rtx™ 3050, 4 gb, 512 gb ssd xps 13 9305: i5-1135g7, intel® iris xe, 8gb ram, 256gb ssd i know that the specs of the xps are worse than the inspiron in every way. is the extra build quality worth it? or should i save the money? backstory: -long lifespan is favourable -light to mid gaming should be smooth (e.g. warthunder) -should be good for traveling i have had fedora 35 on my new dell xps 13 9310 and am really loving it. but the wi-fi has been flaky. many dropped packets and slow speed overall. i \"fixed\" the issue by turning off powersave mode on the ax201 wi-fi adapter, by adding this to a config file in /etc/networkmanager/conf.d/: [connection] wifi.powersave = 2 curious: is anyone else continuing to have issues with ax201 on linux, and how are you solving it? just order xps 17 9710 and it say it coming from harrisburg, us .. i’m on my fifth xps 17 the last 2 years and i never saw it coming from harrisburg, us. is that ok ? am i getting a new laptop? thanks i remember reading somewhere that more options will be available sometime this month, if you wait a few weeks there should be more customisation options available pics received my xps 15 9520 today. been using the 9500 model since 2020. physically, i can\\'t tell any changes. all seem identical to the 9500 or 9510 (last year). look like dell fixed the issue where the laptop opens up slightly when holding it vertically (see pic). the hinge seems stronger but you\\'re still able to open it with 1 hand. no major changes to the internal either except for new intel 12th gen and ddr5. same gpu options as last year (3050/3050ti). there are heat shields on the ram slots. i got the 4k touch screen. still glossy, saturated and sharp like previous models. my unit doesn\\'t have any issue so far. trackpad is good. no double-click problem. touch screen is good. i\\'ll be installing 6tb ssds (2tb + 4tb), 64gb ddr5 ram, and reformatting to a fresh copy of w11 pro. stay tuned for 1 month update. so i got an open box xps 15 9510 a few weeks ago preloaded with windows 11 and had lots of issues. the biggest was the auto brightness went from dark to sun mode with a white background. battery life also seems dismal. i decided last night to do a clean windows 10 install and what a difference! auto brightness actually worked like it should and the system was snappier overall. jury is still out with battery life but has anyone else that has a 9510 seen the same after downgrading? update: went back to win11 after a tip from a redditor. the only difference was not installing the dell drivers from supportassist/dell command. i’m getting much much better battery life! i was asked to post this because the dell site shows the old windows 8 logo on the windows key and it\\'s actually the new windows 11 style, as seen above in the photo of my 9520\\'s keyboard hi! i\\'m kinda desperate. recently bought an dell xps 13 9305 evo - 9672x that works great so far. but when i want to charge it in the car, it only charges like 4%/hr. is there a special charger that i need to use? my macbook air (2020 m1) charges about 60% in the same time on the same charger/cable. any help is appreciated. latest firmaware/bios windows/linux all the same. regards historically, i have always been a thinkpad guy but i was really impressed by xps 13 9510 provided by my employer to me. moreover, x1 extreme gen 5 is still a couple of months away from being available. i currently own x1 nano gen 1, thinkpad w 540, macbook 16 pro late 2019 (intel) model. while i love my x1 nano, i constantly find myself in a position where 16 gb ram is just not sufficient for my use case. i am a developer (primarily a dotnet with angular), i use docker, wsl 2 and many more tools. i have tried a lot to utilize my macbook pro as a primary driver but i never got used to it as much as i would love. i have always felt that i have been a lot more productive with windows than mac. my expected delivery date is may 2nd, i will update as soon as i receive my machine. i hope dell doesn\\'t replicate all the qc/qa issues that it is known for and i am quite excited about my new machine. i will appreciate some reviews if some of you have already received it. i purchased the items in the two links below. both the top and bottom bands (though slim) are too wide for this newer model. why did dell not provide much room between the webcam and the laptop shell? :( so odd... anyhow, has anyone had any luck with finding the perfect solution? periodically, i do have zoom meetings, so i don\\'t want to completely cover the webcam with the black dot that some have suggested. i prefer the sliding method. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b0994cbgxl/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b07sgq22bs/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1 update: i did purchase the pack in the link below until i find something more suitable: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b09mdljj6q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1 pics received my xps 15 9520 today. been using the 9500 model since 2020. physically, i can\\'t tell any changes. all seem identical to the 9500 or 9510 (last year). look like dell fixed the issue where the laptop opens up slightly when holding it vertically (see pic). the hinge seems stronger but you\\'re still able to open it with 1 hand. no major changes to the internal either except for new intel 12th gen and ddr5. same gpu options as last year (3050/3050ti). there are heat shields on the ram slots. i got the 4k touch screen. still glossy, saturated and sharp like previous models. my unit doesn\\'t have any issue so far. trackpad is good. no double-click problem. touch screen is good. i\\'ll be installing 6tb ssds (2tb + 4tb), 64gb ddr5 ram, and reformatting to a fresh copy of w11 pro. stay tuned for 1 month update. hi! i\\'m kinda desperate. recently bought an dell xps 13 9305 evo - 9672x that works great so far. but when i want to charge it in the car, it only charges like 4%/hr. is there a special charger that i need to use?

thank you all and sorry for my poor english! i received my xps 15 9520 yesterday. so far, everything looks and feels good, but the system event log is showing multiple usermodepowerservice events, id 12. this happens a few times a second, then every few seconds, generating hundreds of events. there are two different messages randomly generated by these events: process c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\wudfhost.exe (process id:1528) reset policy scheme from {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e} to {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e} process c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\svchost.exe (process id:2508) reset policy scheme from {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e} to {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e} the events happen when the laptop is powered from its power brick and when on battery. i\\'m wondering if this is a consequence of alder lake power management between the p and e cores. any and all suggestions welcomed. thanks! yeah of course, why would you loose anything. there are two slots. but even if there was only one, you would still be able to keep everything the documentation claims that with the \" direct graphics controller direct output mode, needs to be enabled to connect four external displays. , but i can connect 4 displays with it disabled, enabling it doesn\\'t allow me to add more than 4 displays. this is with the laptop display enabled. so i\\'m not sure why the graphics controller switch is there, as it doesn\\'t seem to do anything? has anyone tried playing warzone specifically on their xps 15 9510 (3050 ti, i7)? i saw a video where it was getting 50+ fps and mine is nowhere near that number. i\\'m running on the lowest settings on 1080p. i just got the laptop (not for gaming) and wanted to know if it was performing correctly. has anyone played warzone, rocket league or minecraft that could tell me how theirs runs and at which settings? also i notice that the intel gpu goes to 100% usage really fast before the 3050 ti starts to ramp up, is this normal? hey everyone, i\\'m considering buying a dbrand skin for my xps 17 to keep it safe from scratches and because i like the look of the black camo skins a lot. on dbrand\\'s site, you can select which parts of the laptop you want to skin. one of these options is the trackpad. i\\'m wondering if the skin affects the trackpad\\'s sensitivity/accuracy. if anyone has a trackpad skin, i would love to hear your experience with it, whether it affects it or not. hello everyone! !n the last week (maybe after the latest updates), only once after turning on the computer, i hear a noise coming from the speakers while listening to music or watching a video. i noticed that it only does this once, it\\'s like there is some kind of distortion in the sound. i\\'m trying to figure out if there is a background process causing this. has anyone had the same problem? thanks edit: windows audio device graph isolation maybe? hi, my dell xps 9510 gpu (rtx 3050) throttles by reducing the memory frequency from 5000 mhz to 810 mhz when the temperature hangs around 54 degrees. it\\'s annoying. i\\'ve been looking for solutions and have tried so many, including :- repasting cpu/gpu. adding thermal stripes outside the heatsink undervolting by modding the laptop elevating it using msi afterburner and reducing the overall gpu frequency to 1500mhz. running on ultra performance dell power manager what i\\'m trying next:- getting a decent cooling pad it\\'s not as though i\\'m hitting top temperatures, and i would likely keep going to 56 degrees and stay there without throttling, but it throttles and hangs out like that forever. any solutions? will do anything. thanks update 4/11 ______________________________________ so as i go through my understanding and wonder of the problem/solution, i\\'ve come to realize a few more areas where i can improve. for one, i think that the issue might be related to the vrm, rather than the temperature i\\'m monitoring from msi afterburner. i realized that :- when i\\'m on battery power, i never hit thermal throttling. so being plugged in raises temperature of the laptop by about 4-5 degrees. sometimes it takes a while before the gpu thermal throttling occurs. even if the temperature reaches 58 degrees, it won\\'t kick in. therefore, the solutions i now plan to implement are :- changing the dell charge setting to primarily ac use using dell power manager. definitely get that cooling pad with 4 fans. my current one with one large fan does not work well. i will also try to plug the cooling pad into the wall socket. change the thermal padding i\\'ve placed in accordance with this article - it has to do with where to place your thermal padding for most benefit and to reduce thermal throttling. fingers crossed! \\u200b how old is your device? formatting your drive really isn\\'t likely to help. it\\'s more likely that your battery has degraded to a point where it\\'s unable to hold more juice :) hello, i have been using my 8950 for a little bit, and i definitely need to get a new cooler. the 12900 does not have the option for liquid cooling or the \"advanced\" cooler. i know there are a lot of posts on the 8940 with upgrading the cpu cooler, but i am not sure if the 8950 and 8940 share the same mounting method. is there any suggestions for the 8950? \\u200b https://preview.redd.it/2kzg61ft7zr81.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0aa6b68643e36cba151838df0b99654f9db655c3 hello everyone! !n the last week (maybe after the latest updates), only once after turning on the computer, i hear a noise coming from the speakers while listening to music or watching a video. i noticed that it only does this once, it\\'s like there is some kind of distortion in the sound. i\\'m trying to figure out if there is a background process causing this. has anyone had the same problem? thanks edit: windows audio device graph isolation maybe? i have got a brand new dell xps 13 9310 which i want to sell but whenever i put it on facebook or ebay, there are scammers everywhere. is there a recommended place to sell brand new laptops in the uk? it literally hasn\\'t been taken out the box! i\\'ve had my dell xps 15 since november and all of a sudden, it just won\\'t turn on. if i press the power button, an amber/orange light shows up under the trackpad as long as i\\'m holding the button down. does anyone know a fix for this? hey all, i\\'m hoping for some advice on a setup i\\'m putting together for work. i\\'m looking to buy a new monitor and laptop, and was thinking about getting the lg 32un880-b and the dell xps 13 9305. https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-32un880-b https://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/laptop-computers-2-in-1-pcs/xps-13-9305/spd/xps-13-9305-laptop/bn93518sb11# basically, i\\'m working hybrid, with some days in the office and some days at home, and when i\\'m in the office i just want to turn up and plug in, no hassle. the lg 32un880-b has a \"1 cable\" solution, where the cable will power the laptop as well as project to the screen. and i was hoping to use the usb ports on the back of the lg 32un880-b to plug in a wireless keyboard/mouse, as those will be sitting at my work station as well. seems like it could be a sweet setup - the lg 32un880-b looks like a great monitor, and if i could just plug in and go that would be amazing. so, i wondered if anyone knew: is what i\\'m proposing possible? does anyone else do this with these models of laptop/monitor? does a lg 32un880-b have enough juice to power a xps 13 9305 laptop? will the usb mouse receivers on the monitor function as expected when the laptop is plugged in? am i missing anything, or have i overlooked anything, or does anyone have a better suggestion to pair with a xps 13 9305? if i\\'m posting in the wrong section, then my apologies. thanks a lot. i believe the most important is flash type. avoid qlc - no matter what fairytales the manufacturers of this crap write - it is slow crap. whenever your cache is over - it will be slow as hell. for the rest - take a closer look at the tests. anyway the drive will throttle at the high load - as well as other components of the laptop. but for sure qlc memory and bad controller will limit you more than thermal throttling. i\\'ve been aware of thermal issues concerning previous model , is it still the case in 2022. btw those dumbass still didn\\'t change the webcam ... hey, i have paid around $ 4k for a laptop, that doesn\\'t sound at all, 13inch macbook has better sound. i wonder if there are any equalizer or some driver issue ? audio is intel smart sound technology for mipi soundwire audio if the 9700 and 9710 are anything to go by, the i9 versions will come out significantly later. i\\'m curious if anyone has purchased a 9720 with the xe graphics and the oled screen, as this combo looks like it might be up my alley. (i\\'m assuming here that dell\\'s site isn\\'t bugged, and this configuration is actually purchasable) i\\'d really be interested in knowing what kind of watt draw this combo has when around 50% screen brightness, on a dark mode text editor. i achieve ballpark 2.9w with my xps 13 9370 with 1080p screen, so if the 9720 can achieve anywhere near 6w (it has roughly double the battery capacity of my 9370), then it would probably be a worthwhile upgrade for me. anybody got this laptop? if so, what do you think? i\\'ve ordered this one with arrival in 3 weeks with these specifications: -12th generation intel® core™ i9-12900hk (24mb cache, up to 5.0ghz, 14 cores) -windows 11 home -32 gb, 2 x 16 gb, ddr5, 4800 mhz, dual-channel -nvidia® geforce rtx™ 3050 ti, 4 gb gddr6, 45 w -2tb ssd -uhd+ 3840x2400, 60hz, touch, anti-reflect -i also want to link this laptop up to the d6000 docking station, is it going to be compatible? upgraded from an xps13 to the 9710 which means none of my usual messenger bags will fit it. anyone have a good recommendation for one that will fit? i just bought an xps 9510 and installed a samsung pro 980 in the second m.2 slot. but it seems to randomly reset the nvme controller. i use ubuntu 22.04 and windows 11. both have what appear to be the same problem. what i\\'ve tried: 1) originally installed without a screw (didn\\'t have one), reseated and screwed in very tightly. i assumed this was the issue but didn\\'t fix it. 2) updated the firmware on the 980 to the latest. 3) updated the bios on the laptop to the latest. 4) disabled raid (was required to update the firmware anyway) the drive itself is certified refurbished by best buy. so i suppose it could be defective though it was tested by them. i ran a full scan via magician twice and it passed both times. but i ran it three other times before and it failed at some point due to controller reset. short of rma is there anything else i should try here or is there a known issue with the controller for the 2nd slot? it sounds like online that almost every instance of this problem is due to bad seating but i\\'ve tried that already. edit: the actual fix 5) put the samsung pro 980 in slot 1 and put the original drive in slot 2 because that makes sense for some reason. we just ordered a couple xps 9310 a month ago with basic screens and went to order some more but there are no 16:10 non-touch/matte screens available let alone non-4k/uhd. last week they didn\\'t even have non-touch 16:9 available. what gives? how long till 12th gen shows up and will the basic options be available then? are they phasing out xps 13 in favor of the \"plus\" edition? i\\'m ready to order xps 8950 - but have a concern. i have a 4k monitor for the display port connection- but i also need to connect an hdmi monitor as 2nd simultaneous monitor. because there is only the dp port listed in specs, is it not possible to also use 2nd hdmi monitor?? thank you! peter anyone, who order 9520/9720, can you share when you will receive the unit ? has anyone tested the oled display that comes with the new 9520? specifically, have they fixed the issues that were discussed online at length about the 9510\\'s oled display, including the screendoor effect and graininess visible mostly on white backgrounds? so my friend is leaving to a new country, he\\'s deciding to retire and stay with his family back in his home country. he has this laptop https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9305-laptop/smx139w11p2c1100p?gacd=9646510-1025-5761040-266794296-0&dgc=st&ds_rl=1282786&gclid=cj0kcqjw_4-sbhcgarisaalegrvzh8neumpkdqp4pbwrwcjgigx4u99euegrdvqquzzwlo-h7w0f48gaahfcealw_wcb&gclsrc=aw.ds&nclid=wudtap8rjnmh5au98aa5byqlv0hyooy4dyrnrhjinp0p9zzdp21iyiaqeopisuut originally bought for $750 he\\'s willing to give it for $300 bucks, i\\'ve seen him use it numerous times and it\\'s always worked good and i\\'ve used it often and recently checked it out everything it seems good. he\\'s selling it off because he bought a mbp so he said he doesn\\'t want/need to keep another laptop. so he offered that if i want to buy it off him i can, i didn\\'t say anything yet but was just wondering. it seems like a real good price, thoughts? how is it possible that the x1 with the same configuration as the xps needs 175w charger vs 130 for xps? especially since it seems like the gpu in xps has higher tdp config? that seems odd to me. does the cpu in x1 use more power especially when both gpu and cpu are stressed? \\u200b if someone knows, i am really qurious since i am deciding between these two. \\u200b greetings has anyone found them yet? like can it take 4tb pci e drives? 64 gigs max ram? No text content ! i suppose this applies to some other dell xps 15 models as well. the dell drivers install with waves maxxaudio pro, that itself now updates independently via the microsoft store. i know that generic realtek drivers will \"work\" with this laptop but never sounded as good as dell\\'s drivers with the the waves app active. however, seeing as waves updates from microsoft store, can i update the actual drivers independently too? for example, when i launch snappy driver installer it shows an updated realtek driver. i\\'m curious if i could actually install the newer driver and it would still work with waves? obviously, i could \"experiment\" and uninstall and reinstall dell drivers if it doesn\\'t work, but i figured i\\'d ask on here. does anyone know if there will be a true replacement for the current xps 13 9310 model? the new xps 13 plus is model 9320 so it\\'s making me skeptical about a non-plus model being made with alder lake. the manual clearly states it\\'s an option but i have no ability to change virtualization settings in the bios? i updated my bios to the latest and it\\'s just not there. i am going to start a new job soon, and after wrestling with a super-small asus e200ha (2017) for the past few years, i am finally giving up and buying a new pc. unlike e200ha, which acted as a web browser/latex processor/occasional office/email machine, i need something that can run statistical software that is fairly processor and ram heavy while being portable. my current options are: xps13 - 9305 and dell inspiron 5410. they will both come with 16gb memory and 512gb ssd. xps has i7 - 1165g7 and inspiron i7 - 11370h. there is a price point difference of about $150, and i am probably not going to buy a new laptop for the next 5 years. i will be giving presentations, running statistical software that can be fairly graphics heavy, and photoshop and illustrator other than your usual office suite. one thing that gives me pause is that there are a lot of people reporting that inspiron\\'s fan overheats, and that it has short battery life. i am not that bothered with graphics or sound output. which would you suggest? i\\'ve noticed that lately when i step away from my (new) 9510 it tends to wake itself from sleep. it gets hot to the touch and the fans are screaming. once i start using it again the temps drop and the fans calm down. any idea what could be causing this behavior? i\\'ve mostly noticed this when the pc is plugged into a dell thundthunderbolterbolt dock. thanks. dell recently released xps 12gen i7 and i9, but how come they only have uhd graphics option? (besides nvidia) i thought intel i9-12900h does have iris xe graphics built-in, what is going on here?? here is the configuration link: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-15-laptop/spd/xps-15-9520-laptop/xn9520cto040s?view=configurations whenever you chose i9, you can\\'t choose iris xe ! i wonder if i reduced the sensitivity and if top of the laptop acts as antenna for wifi. it used to show near 100% signal strength but now its closer to 88-90%. i have dell xps 13 9305 identical software - i benchmarked one, move the ssd over to the new one and re-benchmarked it. it is a warmer day, so it could be throttling more. i will try again when it\\'s cool tonight. i will be rendering on this machine sometimes so i will make use of the difference, no matter how small. cinebench r23 cpu multi-core original xps 9510 i9 11900h: 9413 replacement xps i9 11900h: 8918 the dell engineer who came by earlier to fix a thing (that caused a new problem, hence the replacement) put more thermal paste on the gpu and cpu on the original (better, lighter) unit - could this result in a 500 point difference? since i still have both systems here, i could switch out the motherboard from the old one - do you think it\\'s likely that it\\'s just a \\'better\\' chip, or could the difference be entirely down to thermals? also, 90g is a lot - it\\'s now 1995g - i weighed it because i could tell it was heavier, ~~what could this be? could i have slightly more battery capacity perhaps?~~ edit: ffs, the screen is the ips, not oled - i thought it looked weird. the resolution (3840x2400) confirms it, that explains the weight-gain. (repost because typo in original title) \\u200b i currently have a xps 8500 (i7-3770) and struggling with a decision between two systems in my cart. there is only a $17.00 difference between them and they have the same components except the cpu and gpu. xps 8940: i7-11700 with geforce rtx™ 3060, 12 gb gddr6 xps 8950: i7-12700k with gtx 1650 super™, 4 gb gddr6 i love the 8940 chassis and that 3060 gpu. after staring at the 8500 chassis for six years, i don\\'t like the size of the 8950. however, that i7-12700k cpu is intriguing and if the benchmarks are correct, would make me ignore the chassis size. from a value perspective, which system gives the best bang for your buck? i\\'m a developer with a heavy emphasis on various programming languages, vms, plex, databases and a medium gamer. just purchased the new xps 15 9520 to upgrade my xps 15 9500 (2020 era). i want the new 12th gen intel chip and faster gpu (from the 1650ti). had a 10% discount code from my employer $50 off code 50off699 $120 off 599+ from amex platinum card $200 off dell purchase from amex business platinum card 10% off dell purchase from amex business platinum card 2% rebate from rakuten planning to contact tech support to ask for refund on the pre-installed mcafee virus bs that i don\\'t need. that\\'s a $50 refund. ___________________ my final price would be: $1,481 for the upgrade. planning to sell my 9500 for at least $1k so not a bad purchase at all. will swap out my nvme ssd from the current system to the new one (6tb = 2tb + 4tb). will upgrade the ram to 64gb but not sure if this system will be compatible with my 64gb ram from the 9500 system (ddr4 sodimm). anyone here bought ram upgrades that worked with the 9510? ive been looking at this kit: https://www.newegg.ca/amp/g-skill-32gb-260-pin-ddr4-so-dimm/p/n82e16820374024 or if anyone has bought an aftermarket kit of ram post it in the comment. edit: im looking for 32gb all feedback is much appreciated :). i\\'ve been trying to buy a new laptop recently and one of my realizations was that a lot of them (most?) come with super-slow panels. i\\'ve just returned a thinkpad x1 carbon because of ridiculous amount of ghosting that it had when anything moved on screen. i\\'m now looking at 9310, but it worries me that according to notebookcheck it has just slightly better response times than the x1c9. so i\\'m wondering how do you guys feel about the screen? do you see ghosting when you move your cursor and windows around? for linux users, do you see ghosting when you move the terminal window (this was just comical to watch on x1c9)? when you work with graphics? i guess an alternative would be to get a 4k screen which apparently have better response times, but i\\'m really not convinced it\\'s an appropriate resolution for a laptop. https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-xps-15/spd/xps-15-9520-laptop/ctox15w11p1c4003 https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-xps-15/spd/xps-15-9520-laptop/ctox15w11p1c4002 new inspiron 16 has 1080p webcam https://www.dell.com/en-in/shop/laptops-2-in-1-pcs/inspiron-16-laptop/spd/inspiron-16-5625-laptop/icc-c783520win8 i\\'ve got a new xps 9510, which seems to be exhibiting some very odd behaviour around what it will / won\\'t charge from. the included power supply works fine.

i keep going around in circles with dell support as its not running windows, but presumably that shouldn\\'t make any difference? the devices are showing 15w in bios diagnostics. i used the occt \"power\" stress test for 30 minutes for each of the power plans. room temperature remained fairy constant (2°c difference throughout) and the surface temperature was given time to cool off between runs. and so here are the results with the information i personally find important. https://preview.redd.it/m30awrezgcp81.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f4dc713e8a63445b0d5161b955ed9fc357567bd i have a xps 13 9310 2-in-1 purchased about a year ago, the keyboard was fine up until about 2 months ago. the issue with my keyboard right now is that it sometimes would randomly stop responding while typing, all keys except for the power button would stop responding, and you can see that the caps lock key (which has a illumination indicator) would not illuminate after you press it. to simply solve this issue temporarily, i would flip the screen over (since it\\'s a 2-in-1) to enable tablet mode and flip it back, and the keyboard would work again. however, the problem sometimes can come back as soon as within seconds. if i got lucky, the issue would not come back after a tiny bit longer period of time. i have contacted dell\\'s support team, but their responses were not that helpful since they suggested me to run a diagnostic test specifically for the keyboard, and if the test came out fine but the issue remains, then they would suggest me to replace the keyboard. i dug some research on this issue and asked them more questions but they never responded back, so i figured reddit may be more helpful! to summarize, i have tried the following methods and received the same result: i ran a full hardware and software diagnostic test, as well as an individual test for the keyboard, everything is fine. while the unresponsiveness issue occurred, i left it as was, and i was curious if it was actually responsive or not, i went to \"my dell - support assist - troubleshooting - i wanna check a specific piece of hardware - keyboard\", the test told me to press the keys it was showing, and it actually recorded the history of what i was pressing; although i did it while the issue occurred where the caps lock key was also not illuminated after pressing, the test history would recognize the caps lock key being pressed. overall, this test showed that the keys are probably not mechanically damaged, since it could recognize the entering while the issue was occurring. i also found out that sometimes after the issue occurred, some keys would work, but some would not. specifically, one time the issue came out, and i was pressing random keys in a word doc, and saw that some letter keys as well as some other number and function keys worked, but some did not work, which was weird. but this doesn\\'t happen every time. i have tried updating the bios to the latest bios, and the latest bios is 2.8.1 released on march 14th, 2022, but the update still did not solve the problem. i have tried pressing \"f2\" while turning on the laptop to enter the bios setup page, and under the \"keyboard\" setting, i have tried both \"restore to factory default\" and \"bios default setup\" trying to see if that could solve the issue, but no luck at all as the issue still would randomly come back. i have tried reinstalling windows 11 and still no luck, because i recall that this issue did not happen before i updated from windows 10 to windows 11, but this issue did not actually start occurring immediately after the windows 11 update, since i did the update in november, but this issue started occurring a couple of months ago. i think one time while the issue was happening, i opened up an adobe acrobat pdf file, and i recall that there was a message prompted saying something like \"touch ability or touch mode or touch something was enabled\", which made me into thinking that the cause of the issue could have been that the laptop may sometimes falsefully detect the tablet mode was enabled, so it would actually make sense that the keyboard would stop working?? however, every time when this issue occurred, i would take a look at the right bottom corner trying to see if a keyboard symbol for screen typing would appear so that i would know it was indeed in the tablet mode, but the symbol was not there. i also have tried uninstalling each of the keyboard drivers shown in \"device manager\" and restarted the laptop right after to let it install them back automatically, but no luck either, problem still remains. also, there is currently no newer keyboard driver available for download so i cannot test that out. lastly, i have tried connecting an external keyboard to the laptop during the issue happening, the external keyboard worked fine and interestingly, i did an experiment by pressing the caps lock key on the external keyboard, and the caps lock key on the laptop illuminated; but then if i went to press the caps lock key on the laptop it would not illuminate. as a result, this test also showed that it really might not be a internal mechanical issue, but rather a software/system bug or issue. if you have experienced the same issue and have resolved it, please let me know. of course, if you have some suggestions for me to try, i would love to do so, thanks!! so dell unveiled the \"xps 13 plus\" with new keyboards and trackpad, but tbh i don\\'t like it...would dell release the 12th gen versions of the existing xps 13 / new xps 13? just curious. hey everyone, i\\'m a complete newbie, but i need help with something i don\\'t know much about. i have a: dell xps 9510, 16gb ram, 3050, 1080p i\\'m looking to upgrade my ram for work as i am a photographer and work a lot with after effects, photoshop, lightroom classic, premiere pro, etc. \\u200b i am looking to buy the crucial 32gb ram because i have heard good things about it. however, when looking online, there is a 32gb kit with 3200mhz, and another kit same with 32gb and 3200mhz but it has \"dual rank\". what is dual rank and will it work with my xps 9510?

(usb mouse is completely unaffected as is my bluetooth mouse) i spent the last few days digging through forums and found a lot of people with the same issues across a bunch of different dell models. has anyone with this model or a different model had the same issue and figured out a way to fix it? i love the hardware on this computer i just can’t stand windows and want to figure out some way to make this usable again hey everyone, i\\'m a complete newbie, but i need help with something i don\\'t know much about. i have a: dell xps 9510, 16gb ram, 3050, 1080p i\\'m looking to upgrade my ram for work as i am a photographer and work a lot with after effects, photoshop, lightroom classic, premiere pro, etc. i am looking to buy the crucial 32gb ram because i have heard good things about it. however, when looking online, there is a 32gb kit with 3200mhz, and another kit same with 32gb and 3200mhz but it has \"dual rank\". what is dual rank and will it work with my xps 9510? or will it be a lot better than the regular 32gb? thank you in advance! does the dell xps 15 9510 not allow you to change your power plan through the control panel? i can\\'t seem to find it. or is the only way to change it through the battery icon on the taskbar? so dell unveiled the \"xps 13 plus\" with new keyboards and trackpad, but tbh i don\\'t like it...would dell also release the 12th gen versions of the existing xps 13 / new xps 13? just curious. i\\'ve had the 9510 for a month now. one thing i\\'ve noticed is that the fans will sometimes randomly spin up very fast for a second then immediately turn back off (i\\'m on the quiet profile doing light tasks). i\\'ve done monitoring and there is no spike in cpu temps when the fans turn on. anybody know what the issue could be? my lcd broke twice now. i don\\'t overuse the system, and i always close all windows before putting it to sleep. what could be causing it to fail? i\\'ve heard the gpu has a very low tolerance to temperature, which leads it to brick the monitor. basically the title. i just picked up a 9510 and am very happy with it so far. i noticed that there is an unpopulated m.2 slot. i have a spare 1tb crucial m.2 drive laying around. can i screw it in and use it as like a media drive or something like that? i\\'ve had the 9510 for a month now. one thing i\\'ve noticed is that the fans will sometimes randomly spin up very fast for a second then immediately turn back off (i\\'m on the quiet profile doing light tasks). i\\'ve done monitoring and there is no spike in cpu temps when the fans turn on. anybody know what the issue could be? i was a happy xps 9710 owner with an undervolt applied from the bios edit. my laptop automatically upgraded to the newest 9710 1.7.2 bios over the weekend. unfortunately my throttlestop voltage offsets stopped working. i have tried to downgrade my bios to 1.6 and 1.5 and unfortunately the bios edit no longer works. :( be sure to turn off your bios uefi auto update! hi all! i am waiting on my 65watt dell charger to arrive, but i need access to the laptop in the meantime for my sole proprietorship. trying to use an apple 96w power adapter with a type c cable, but the laptop won\\'t charge. (laptop is currently fully dead). i also tried a 100w j5 created, but this didn\\'t work either any advice would be greatly appreciated. thank you! so, i already have undervolted my cpu by followed this guide: https://brendangreenley.com/undervolting-2020-dell-laptops-like-the-vostro-7500-and-more-tips-to-improve-thermals-battery-life-and-speed/#cpu-undervolt but my dgpu (rtx 3050ti) is still not letting my change anything besides the clock speed. does anybody know how to get access to the gpu voltages? hey all just bought a dell xps 17 9710 and the mic on my headphones is not working on certain applications such as zoom but it does work on others like slack. please advise. thanks in advance hello, i bought xps 15 9510 laptop with 16 gb (2x8gb) preinstalled memory. i also ordered 32gb ram stick from kingston (kcp432sd8/32). my question is, if it is okay to swap one of the 8gb sticks with 32gb so i have in total 40gb, or it would be better not to combine different stick and put only 32gb in and let the other slot empty. for me 32gb is sufficient, but if there are no cons in 32gb + 8gb combination, i would be happy with 40gb. thanks hi all! i am waiting on my 65watt dell charger to arrive, but i need access to the laptop in the meantime for my sole proprietorship. trying to use an apple 96w power adapter with a type c cable, but the laptop won\\'t charge.

(type c) - i tried a 100-watt j5 create charger (this did not work) - the apple type c to type c cable does not work at all. - tried a different type c to type c cable with the apple power adapter, but this barely gave me any juice. it allowed me to turn on the laptop, but got me to a screen that said the battery is critically low. [backstory: my fiance and myself got a new puppy. he snuck into the room and chewed my dell power adapter cord this morning (unplugged).] thank you all for any help you can give! i wanna upgrade ram on my xps 9510. so right now i have 8x8 3200mhz ram. i was wondering if i could switch out one of the sticks with a 16 or 32gb 3200mhz stick. how would this affect performance? would this powerbank (45w max output) be fine with charging a dell xps 13 9305 or i would be better off buying dell notebook power bank plus – usb c, 65wh - pw7018lc - 18000 mah (currently on sale)? thanks. i got my new xps 9510 with an oled screen a few days ago, and i really like it. however, i noticed that the top left corner is brighter than the bottom right corner. this is the most noticeable on when the screen is black and the brightness is low (lower than 50%). has anyone else noticed this, or am i the only one having this problem? i have just received my laptop \" dell xps 13 9310 \" yesterday. i was just setting it up and fo7nd that the adapter doesn\\'t work and the battery just emptied very fast. what should i do? i have a full specced 2021 xps with i9 and 3050ti every time i close my xps 9710 (it goes into sleep mode) the laptop always overheats to extreme temperatures and drains the battery out. additionally, the laptop often crashes into a blue screen and displays that the laptop didn\\'t restart correctly. i have tried many suggested pieces of advice on similar threads (except for the hibernate mode, very inconvenient for me) and there is no improvement in the situation. the laptop still overheats every time the lid is closed, despite that the laptop always rests on the flat surface in a cool room. additionally, the keyboard backlights sometimes simply refuse to shine. then in the next hour, they work as nothing happened. this issue also happens every day. the backlighting sometimes refuses to light even if the keyboard light button is pressed. the most annoying issue is the constantly freezing/disconnecting/reconnecting razer deathadder elite mouse, which is plugged through an adapter. the mouse is working properly, as i don\\'t experience the same issues when using it with different laptops. however, when it is plugged into my xps 9710, the mouse annoyingly reconnects to the laptop or freezes every other minute. i have tried nearly every solution to this issue (disabling saving power management for usb ports and mouse, reinstalling razer software, deleting the mouse from the device manager, resetting the mouse, reinstalling the mouse drivers, buying a quality belkin adapter), however, the issue is still here and the mouse is constantly malfunctioning. has anyone else experienced the issues above or has found working solutions? when is the dell 9510 going to receive windows 11? all new dell laptops comes with windows 11 and the latest models before windows 11 still don\\'t got it. why? i have full specced 2021 xps 17 with i9 and 3050 ti every time i close my xps 9710 (it goes into sleep mode) the laptop always overheats to extreme temperatures and drains the battery out. additionally, the laptop often crashes into a blue screen and displays that the laptop didn\\'t restart correctly. i have tried many suggested pieces of advice on similar threads (except for the hibernate mode, very inconvenient for me) and there is no improvement in the situation. the laptop still overheats every time the lid is closed, despite that the laptop always rests on the flat surface in a cool room. additionally, the keyboard backlights sometimes simply refuse to shine. then in the next hour, they work as nothing happened. this issue also happens every day. the backlighting sometimes refuses to light even if the keyboard light button is pressed. the most annoying issue is the constantly freezing/disconnecting/reconnecting razer deathadder elite mouse, which is plugged through an adapter. the mouse is working properly, as i don\\'t experience the same issues when using it with different laptops. however, when it is plugged into my xps 9710, the mouse annoyingly reconnects to the laptop or freezes every other minute. i have tried nearly every solution to this issue (disabling saving power management for usb ports and mouse, reinstalling razer software, deleting the mouse from the device manager, resetting the mouse, reinstalling the mouse drivers, buying a quality belkin adapter), however, the issue is still here and the mouse is constantly malfunctioning. has anyone else experienced the issues above or has found working solutions? i recently purchased a 9510. during setup, i declined the windows 11 upgrade. (i didn\\'t want to deal with a new os while setting up / moving into a new machine.) now i\\'d like to give win11 a try. how do i trigger an upgrade? i currently own an xps 15 9570, and unfortunately the \\'sticky left hinge\\' issue has nearly destroyed the laptop. i was out of the country when it began, and i was unable to deal with it before it became a bigger problem. i\\'m generally savvy at basic computer repair and have disassembled my xps more times than i can count, but the damage at this point is beyond my abilities. i am shopping for a new laptop in the same class, and i do really like the new xps. however, what are the known issues with the device? i want to make sure i am aware of potential problems before i buy. in retrospect, xps 9560/9570 hinge issues are a known and widespread problem, but i did not figure that out until too late. \\u200b i\\'m aware of the hinge issue where the screen won\\'t stay closed, but haven\\'t found too many others. i am mostly concerned about issues that develop down the road, ie out of the return window. \\u200b thank you! previously i was having few issues on my my xps 15. however over the past few weeks when i try to play games like destiny on the lowest possible settings my fps is terrible. it will run well when i tab in at like 90 fps for about 30 seconds and then it immediately drops to like 40 and stutters a lot. i have tried everything i can to fix it but i can\\'t seem to get anything to work. \\u200b does anyone have a similar issue or a fix for it? any news on xps 15 9520 (2022 version)? i really want 12th gen intel cpu (great on battery). i have dell credits of close to $500 (amex plat + biz) that i need to use before june. thanks in advance. my device came pre-installed with windows 11 :(... is there anyone who has expierence uninstalling and installing windows 10 on the device instead? is it possible? how difficult was it? if i unplug the earphones during a live stream such as youtube or twitch, it is silent and i have to reload the browser (f5) to solve the problem, even if i plug it again. the same applies to video playback, and if unplugged during playback, silence will continue. of course, if you skip 15s (back) or reload (f5), you will hear sound. has anyone manged to get the 9310 to power on when a usb dock is plugged in? i want name and email, so i can send an email and insult him if i unplug the earphones during a live stream such as youtube or twitch, it is silent and i have to reload the browser (f5) to solve the problem, even if i plug it again. the same applies to video playback, and if unplugged during playback, silence will continue. of course, if you skip 15s (back) or reload (f5), you will hear sound. \\u200b of course, the drivers, etc. are up-to-date. i got the laptop from dell outlet and did some cpu stress test with prime95. during the test some cores of the cpu reached as high as 100c before cooling to upper 60s low - 70s. tested it on windows 11 and used core temp to read cpu stats. i set in power manager thermal mode to ultra performance. wonder if any owner of xps13 has seen cpu temp reach that high during cpu stress test. replacing my palmrest/keyboard (again) and was hoping to pick up one from a 9510 instead of a 9500 (dkfwh) in the hopes of minimizing trackpad trouble. got an xps 13 9305. i want to upgrade the ssd from 512gb to 1tb. what screwdriver sizes would i need? (to anyone who has upgraded them before) the samsung ssd drives would work as long as it doesn\\'t come with a heatsink attached to it right? thank you. does the xps-13 9300/9310 have sleep / standby? i\\'ve read that they\\'ve eliminated \"s0\" on modern laptops (across all brands), so laptops aren\\'t sleeping normally and end up draining the battery. are those of you using linux also seeing these issues? thanks! love this laptop still. it’s a great work machine and 3d render generator. but i had my first fail during a teams interview with the mic stop working and realtek driver crash. i could hear them but they could only watch me scramble to voice over on my cell. i’ve used zoom and webex with no problems. hi, i use a dell xps 15 9510, it\\'s a great machine. when i editing photos in photoshop or lightroom i will switch to ultra performance in the dell power manager. i have two questions about that: 1: if i switch the profile to ultra performance, the engery plan on windows 11 stays at \"balanced\" - is that right? will dell\\'s power manager override the windows settings? 2: is it possible to switch the ultra performance mode automatically? or is it possible to toggle with hot keys? thanks for your help purchased an xps 8950 from dell and after a lengthy delay, it finally arrived. problem is, when i turn it on it seems to boot up (have power and the led on the tower is on) but there is no video output whatsoever. my running hypothesis is that because i had downgraded the gpu from the default gtx to an integrated one (i believe uhd 770?), the computer is maybe configured to output using nvidia? and it was never changed to intel when they took out the gpu. so a software or bios reset might do the trick, but how can i do anything when i can\\'t get a video output? i should also mention that the hdmi port seems very loose. as in, when i plug in hdmi, it doesn\\'t seem to go in (there isn\\'t that click and tightening feel when you know it\\'s properly in). i tried it with different hdmi cables, no luck. because i had downgraded the gpu, i only have one hdmi port (where the usb ports are in the back). i ordered a usbc to hdmi cable to see if it\\'s a problem with port. if that doesn\\'t work either, we\\'ll be able to conclude it\\'s likely a gpu setting issue. has anybody else ran into this problem? if i open it up to check inside, would that void the warranty? i was hoping they\\'d be out by early march but that clearly isn\\'t the case, this is more specifically for the laptop with the 12th gen chips in the old (non-xps 13 plus) chassis. any idea when it\\'s gonna be out? i\\'m in a bit of a pickle with this machine. originally showed up with windows. i slicked that for ubuntu 20.04 i have tried the common tricks to get windows installed. i\\'d like to go back to windows 11 but have had a lot of trouble with the installation. the bios is set to ahci/nvme mode not to raid. secure boot has been turned off, and tried with it on. the windows iso boots just fine, but the installer doesn\\'t see any compatible drives. i have the intel rst vmd f6 drivers on a usb that i can access during install. they even show up with the option to only show drivers for my hardware selected. however they do not install. every option i try fails, and says to find an updated driver from the vendor. i\\'ve tried with the .inf, .cat, and .sys files from intel, and from dell specifically. nothing has worked to get me access to this hard drive to install windows. i have run a vm in virtualbox with windows 10 to download a dell recovery iso. this also fails to do much good as it does not download a full windows installer. i have also attempted to slipstream the irst drivers in the boot.wim with dism on my windows vm. i\\'ve been a sysadmin/system engineer for about 13 years. feel free to get as technical as you want. i just want to get windows back on this thing. thank you for your input. right now the xps 15 with the i7 11800h, rtx 3050, 16 gb ram, 512 gb ssd, 1920x1080 is on $400 cheaper. should i buy it now or wait for a sale during back to school. is this the cheapest the xps 15 is going be? -going to be in college soon -light gaming -mostly youtube and school -what is the average battery life i should expect -should i buy the xps 13 9305 instead (saves a lot of money) -don’t need it immediately can wait until the summer getting an xps 8950 and was going to go with the 12700, but has since learned that it comes with stock cooling and that it is insufficient and prone to overheating (and throttling). the alternative is to upgrade to the 12700k for an extra $100 which comes with a 125w advanced cooling fan/heatsink. there is also a liquid cooling option for an extra $50 on top of that ($150 total). any experiences or recommendations on how to handle this? willing to upgrade but dont want to just throw away money if ya know what i mean. hi all, i bought a used xps15 9560 about 1,5 years ago. the warranty expired in july 2019. i\\'m afraid it\\'s filled with a lot of stuff i don\\'t need and maybe it has some bloatware and malware on it as well, so i thought about doing a clean install and get a fresh start. i\\'m quite a bit in doubt if i should reinstall win10 pro or try out win11? the programs i use most are vmware, gns3, chrome, onenote, pycharm and visual paradigm and i don\\'t play games, would i benefit from installing win11? i read a guide on how to reinstall win10 on a dell xps 9510 here, and was rather confused about raid vs ahci. i tried reading up about it, but i\\'m still not sure what the differences are, can anyone explain it to me like im 5? i ordered samsung 980 with gen 4 interface to replace stock drive in my laptop. i will install linux on it. i read the original heatsink that comes with stock drives does not fit 970 evo plus but 980 runs cooler so i might actually not need it. hi, i am looking to sell a couple months used 9710 i9hk, 64gb ram, nvidia 3060, 1tb ssd, uhd+ display. in the us. paid $3560 for it. please dm me if you would like to make an offer. shipping in usa only. due to my change in work, need to get a mac. mostly used connected to desktop monitors. no scratches or anything. hey guys, so i\\'ve recently purchased a xps 15 9510 and have been having a lot of trouble with the trackpad. trackpad cursor movement is very very floaty, sometimes the trackpad doesn\\'t even work when i e.g swipe to the left. i have installed both ubuntu and popos now and frankly for both the trackpad just acts very weird. on windows it was completely fine. did anyone else deal with this? been having this issue with maxxaudiopro where every time i open it or plug in my headphones, i just get greeted with a black screen. i\\'ve tried reinstalling realtek drivers and maxxaudiopro but they did nothing to solve the issue if anyone experienced anything similar and/or know how to solve this it would be great if you can help out. thanks! https://preview.redd.it/5f9eecz5tjm81.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cc5906e882991e5829d83310e10693ef1b452ad considering between dongles that plug directly into the ports or dongles that has a cable attached to it. i assume the dongles that plug directly into ports might be wobbly/ have connection issues but i reckon they look cleaner/ less clutter. i\\'m considering purchasing refurb from dell outlet. how long does it take for screen to be useable (using touch/pen)? hi! first question is just to confirm that gen4/ nvme 1.4 is supported in the 9710. it looks like from the documentation, it 100% is, so i guess this isn\\'t really a question just a sanity check. the second question is about heat management: everything i\\'ve read is that gen4 ssds get hot. i see from videos (haven\\'t opened up my 9710 yet, but i will) that there\\'s a copper heatsink at least. but laptops are always poorer at heat management than desktops. is this a reason to stick with gen3 installed into my laptop? . . . \\u200b longer text with more details, before i edited down for readability: i already own two hard drives available to upgrade my xps 9710 i recently purchased. whichever one i don\\'t use, goes into my desktop instead. one is a gen4, phison e18 controller ssd rated for 7100 mbps, which is 56.8 gbps the other is a 2-yr-old gen3 ssd, rated for 3500 mbps, which is 28 gbps \\u200b according to dell, it suggests both are supported, but gen3 is limited to 32 gbps, gen4 to 64 gbps, which matches up pretty closely actually. oddly it only lists a 1tb gen3 ssd?! i imagine, that\\'s simply what you can order through dell, not that it\\'s limited to only 1tb for gen3. https://dl.dell.com/topicspdf/xps-17-9710-laptop\\\\_users-guide\\\\_en-us.pdf so i found that for some reason, if i forced turn-off the machine hard pressing power button for 15 sec, you will not be able to turn on the computer again (by pressing power button), the desktop will refuse to power on again unless i unplugged and replugged the power outlet, anyone got similar issues? tried this numerous times and was repeatable. and my current support experience is also less than stellar: called for warranty, asked for onsite repair, was told there is a part shortage 3 weeks without an update, called and push for a solution suddenly i got spammed by the repair center\\'s messages (2 email 2 sms) asking me to confirm a repair appointment on the same day in the afternoon, and the system is in such a sorry state i cannot confirm the appointment(tried three different devices, 2 browser, wifi/5g) until like 1 hour later, i even got a name and number for technician. so i took a leave of absence in the afternoon to wait, no one came. called dell demanding answer and compensation for outright decommiting to an appointment was escalated to advance resolution team, and was told the following (worst part of the experience): no, dell will not compensate or be sorry for the no-show despite i took the afternoon off for it. there is no eta on repair parts when confronted, the agent literally said: i think i know more about this product than you do (the inner engineer in me rolls my eyes) he also hinted that i am on \"basic\" warranty (i am sure we all understand the implication) when he sends me a list of exchange proposal, it is missing cooling option (i am on upsell water cooled) and color (silver upsell), both cost around 30~50usd extra, but the agent, in his reply told me to \"carefully read my previous email/statement about what you can\\'t choose\", but these are completely separate issues and has cost delta! they were escalated again, and was promised, yes they will make sure water cooling and silver is included suddenly got a bunch of appointment notification from dell contractor again for repair, but a guy called and said: there are two parts needed, one just arrived, but the previous one arrived so long ago that it was returned to the sender, so we are still one part short. god...not only is the service/repair system and process a dumpster fire, the \"advance\"resolution team is not only not professional but also extremely unfriendly... would not recommend if you plan on just doing basic warranty. i\\'m waiting to get an xps 15 until they are updated with intel 12th gen. is there any info about when that might happen? and if so will it be in the current 9510 chassis or a new chassis? i noticed that you are no longer able to outfit the xps 9510 with a 4k screen on the official dell website, only fhd or oled. are they just working through old supply in preparation for the next generation? as the title says, i can\\'t enable the sound options to pop up as an option on windows 10 home 21h2 when i connect to my lg oled55c9pla tv. i do have wd19tbs docking station but this issue persists if i simply use the usb-c/hdmi adapter that came with the laptop in the package directly. i updated the dell drivers first when i bought it, which led to the discovery of the hdmi issue. still no sound. tried a new cable and tried different port on tv. still no sound. i tried all combinations of realtek and intel dch drivers from the intel support site. ended up having the device manager having a few exclamation marks on smart sound bus and/or smart sound verification technology items. still no sound. went back to dell support tool and let it install the dell releases of the mentioned drivers. now device manager is happy. still no sound. tried older drivers from intel and dell. still no sound. i don\\'t claim mastering google-fu but an online search shows that there is hardly any solution but many people had hit-and-misses. i don\\'t get how my 6 year old xps 15 is dancing around all the devices (despite the fact that it had the bloated battery problem and had a motherboard bend), but this new one is so bad at discovering/communicating with peripherals around it.so far i only got bad experience with the bluetooth and hdmi. anybody has any suggestions left to try? hi there, i\\'m probably not the only one with this question. anyone played elden ring on their xps 9510 (rtx 3050 ti mobile)? if so, please describe how it runs, and at what settings you are playing it. thanks in advance! edit: please specify your cpu and ram too (i am i7, 32 gb ram) ahoy there! i\\'m trying to connect two portable monitors to xps 13 (9310) via tb16 dock but i\\'m having no luck. the monitors in question are: eviciv 4k uhd (3840 x 2160) arzopa 4k ultra hd (3840 x 2160) is it possible? what kind of cables i would need? so far i managed to connect one of them directly to the laptop, with the other one connected via usb-c on the tb16 dock. but the one connected through the dock sometimes works, sometimes not, and sometimes just flickers... ideally i would be able to connected them both via the tb16, leaving laptop ports free for other usage. should i use the hmdi or the displayports instead of usb-c? what specific cables i would need (link to exact ones would be swell!)? while i\\'m not to shabby when it comes to the software part of things, hardware leaves me baffled. i would greatly appreciate help here!'"

       "'dell xps 17 9710 (i7 11800h | 32gb ram | rtx3050) - bios issue when changing a setting 2 amber lights, 8 white lights \"display failure - ec detection of power rail failure\". hello everyone, i purchased an xps 17 9710 in january 2020 and just after 1 week of use i entered the uefi bios (version 1.6.0) and changed some settings, nothing serious just the keyboard backlight and battery settings. after restart, the pc won´t pass dell logo (no post) as dell call it. and the status light in the front of the laptop flashed 2 times amber and 8 times white. started to research on it and found out that according to dell \"display failure - ec detection of power rail failure\". dell support team troubleshooted the device and then advice for a motherboard replacement due to the that power rail failure. a month later i received my device and entered bios... i was in real disbelief when again the same happened, and again the motherboard was replaced. after the second replacement i updated the uefi bios firmware to the latest version and as my warranty is running out, i contacted dell to talk about this. the support agent ran a couple of test on my computer and advised to enter the boot menu and run an extensive diagnostic on the machine. every test passed without any issues, and from that same boot menu screen i entered the bios once again almost 1 year after the 2° mobo replacement. it went ok, i just browsed through the options without making any change whatsoever. i do not have the confidence to make any changes to a bios setting even with the latest firmware. the laptop has been working flawlessly, i just don´t want to lose my pc for 1 month again while dell issues a replacement for me. do anyone has had this issue? could you please confirm if recent bios firmware do not compromise the power rail as it happened twice to me? any help would be appreciated.'"

       " 'xps helpdell 8950 - continuous audio dropouts... in week three of ownership of an 8950 (i7, 32gb, 3060i, 750w) and its been a good experience. from the start, i noticed that the tidal pc app would disconnect during music playback about every 3-5 minutes, and remain in a disconnected state. my audio pipeline is 8950, yamaha/steinberg asio driver, usb out, usb in on yamaha dac/amp - home wifi network. this combo of audio hardware/software/network, and their settings, worked perfectly with my previous laptop since joining tidal last january. at first, i faulted the tidal pc app, as it actually disconnects, and throws an error \"chosen audio output has been disconnected\". nothing is disconnected as far as i can tell. i have been working with the tidal tech team to diagnose this problem - no fixes yet. but, over the past few weeks, ive tried other audio apps, such as foobar 2000, tidal web app, and tidal android app (running on win11) and while these apps dont \"disconnect\", there is a noticeable audio dropout of about 1-2 seconds on the same cadence - about every 3-5 minutes. maybe these other apps \"handle\" the dropout better than the tidal pc app? they have a dropout, but then keep playing - the tidal pc app remains disconnected. this leads me to think that theres something happening with the 8950 that is causing the audio disconnects/dropouts. so now i am looking into every setting that could cause a sleep or similar-type state in the 8950 usb ports, interfaces, everywhere. a quick look into online posts, and i see a history of 8950/8940 issues with audio, and people talking about the gpu drivers causing similar issues. first, i am going to exhaust all possible settings that could lead to an idle or sleep state, causing the disconnect. after that, i am up to whatever you folks suggest. maybe this has been resolved already? i really need to be able to listen to audio for more than just a few minutes without dropouts. ive been able to do this for decades, on far less capable/expensive hardware. if i cant make this happen, ill be returning this machine. tia for any help you can provide!',\n",

       " 'psa: preventing realtek ethernet device from \"disappearing\" while in deep sleep hi all - ive been a dell laptop user for years -- from an xps 15 9530, to an xps 15 9560, and now an xps 17 9720. the 17 is excellent -- except i learned that on waking up from sleep, the laptop no longer sees the realtek usb gbe family controller (not even in device manager, and not even if i show hidden devices or scan for changes). when its in that state i can only connect to the network via wi-fi. a lot of googling yielded results that show people suffering from this issue for more than 10 years. turns out that its the classic issue of windows turning off the device to save power. this puts the device into \"deep sleep\" where its not even detected by windows anymore -- and it happens most frequently when you allow windows to go into sleep mode. seems that the quick fix (once the device is out of sleep again) is to: 1) go into device manager / network adapters 2) double click / open the entry for the realtek ethernet controller (whatever yours may be called) 3) go to the power management tab and uncheck the option to \"allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\". 4) click ok, and then close device manager. oddly, some devices know how to wake up properly as soon as power is present. for ex: intel / killer wi-fi adapters have no problem and wake up instantly after sleep. same with wan miniport, bluetooth radios, etc. i find it pretty weird that people have been dealing with this issue with realtek ethernet adapters for more than a decade, but computers are still being distributed with that power management setting by default allowing these devices to go into deep sleep and becoming unusable. oh well. at least this fix seems promising.',\n",

notebookcheck says this runs half the speed of the i5 p chip in the plus. i would be much more accepting of this speed reduction if this unit was fanless. the ativbook was fanless, and performed well for a machine without a fan for its time. i was hoping the xps fan would only run when i really pushed it and also spread its wings a little bit with the headroom of the fan to give me good performance. instead, we got the disadvantages of both the fanless and fan machines in this design. my old 9310 kept its fan off until a much higher temp was reached and ran passively almost all the time which was one reason i loved it. if you want to run linux, the webcam requires a proprietary kernel driver and software that isnt in most linux distros so unless you run dells modified ubuntu image, getting the camera working is a nightmare if you dual boot or run linux exclusively. i dont know much about windows, however, from what i read, it seems like folks are having stability issues with the drivers on that operating system as well. when pushing on the display of the 9315 lightly next to the camera (i do this to open the lid), the unit makes a creaking/cracking noise. the old 9310 had metal reinforcement in front of the display which held it firmly in place. i wish i had kept my 9310 as it was rock solid. based on what i am hearing about the 9320 and my experience with the 9315, it really seems like dell wrecked a good thing with these new units. there is so much out there with similar specs for less money that will perform better, which i saw from benchmarks that had come out after i ordered my unit. i went for the xps because i was hoping for the build, reliability, and linux support that xps is known for, even though i knew there were other machines in this class with more performance. the main theme i have noticed this year for better performance seems to be ryzen. the asus s13 is in this same class and gets great ratings although i have never seen one. i had a friend with a hp devone and that really impressed me; that might be a possibility if you want rock solid linux support as it runs with the mainline kernel just fine according to my friend (i will likely go this route). the devone is slightly thicker, however, you get the nifty trackpoint, great travel keyboard, and all sorts of ports, as well as great cooling. things that i originally looked over due to my experience of reliability, and good linux mainline support with xps in the past: dell claims they removed the headphone jack from the 9315 to meet design goals. the ativbook 12.2 was thinner then the 9315 and had two usb a, mini hdmi, power, and headphone. i know dell wants a certain look with these machines that probably doesnt include usb a ports, however, one more usb c and micro sd reader would have been great additions to the 9315. if you are using headphones and charging, you are out of ports. asus included the headphone jack and an extra usb c on their s13 for a total of three and it is a similar thickness. the asus and ativbook dont have soldered sds and the 9315 does. i knew about these disadvantages when i bought the xps, however, i was willing to look past them due to my positive experiences with linux support, build quality, and reliability of previous xps units; now they just add to the other disadvantages. improvements id like to see next year: i get that this isnt supposed to be the ultra fast machine for developers. if we are going to keep this chassis next year with minimal ports and the soldered ssd, lets get rid of that fan and add a 60 or 70wh battery so its an all day extremely portable machine. this would make the soldered ssd, and few ports worthwhile. i could see myself owning the machine i just described, as well as a slightly thicker machine for my heavy compiling jobs. dell innovated on the outside of the xps 13+ with the touchbar and new keyboard, which although i think is pretty neat, i wont buy because i am a developer and like to be able to strike the fn keys by touch when using my editor. maybe next year, they can focus the innovation effort on the inside and determine a way to cool the successor to the 9315 ultra thin model without a fan. id also like to see dell moving back to a place where there machines are supported by the mainline linux kernel, as opposed to needing proprietary linux images. there has been great work with xps fingerprint readers now being supported, however, the lack of support for the web camera in these latest models is a backslide. hp releasing the devone provides serious linux competition from another main manufacture of laptops, and dell will need to step up their game to compete.',\n",

       " 'possible solution for video playback stuttering on xps 9520 hi, ive been following several posts on this subreddit re. video stuttering on various xps models. i think i might have a solution but first ill describe the problem im trying to solve so there is less confusion about what it is im posting about.  igpu is being used for playback (intel iris xe) latest xe drivers from dell are installed near latest bios installed (1.4.0) mostly used on ac power machine is not rebooted for many days after several sleep/wake cycles, the playback of videos, especially uhd/hdr videos, is choppy with lots of stuttering inspection in task manager shows the video decode graph showing high usage inspection of igpu clock rates (using software such as hwinfo or gpu-z) shows that its never going above 100mhz (the default/idle rate) when it should be going up to rates like 1400mhz when decoding uhd video; its believed that this failure to use higher clock rates is causing the video to fail to decode in a timely manner which in turn produces the stuttering now there are other posts describing this issue and discussing solutions such as a clean install and then installing dells drivers but not installing the my dell app, but instead installing the older dell power manager. its unclear to me whether this solution is a success.  instead, i investigated the my dell app. it turns out that its built on top of a windows service that dell ships with the my dell app called fusion. when you launch the my dell app, it talks to the fusion service to get system information.  now my possible solution is simple: stop the fusion service, disable it in the services management console (services.msc), and then reboot.  ive been using my xps for many days now and the stuttering no longer occurs on it. a week or so ago i had to change my power settings using my dell so i re-enabled the fusion service, made my change and then left the service running. a day or so later, the stuttering returned. i then disabled the fusion service again, rebooted the machine, and so far its been good (no stuttering).  if i had to guess, id say that when the machine wakes from sleep, the fusion service is setting (or not setting) the igpu clock rates correctly (or rather, its not enabling the clock rates to ramp up if needed but instead is locking the rate to 100mhz). if this is the case, disabling the service prevents it from messing up the clock rate locking. this is just a wild guess though.  now i dont promise this is a working solution. im just stating that it appears to stop the stuttering from occurring on my machine. it might not be successful on yours.  anyway, i hope this helps. please let me know if you have any luck with this possible solution.  thanks for reading.',\n",
       " 'xps 15 9520 i9 oled 32gb and 1tb trackpad and touch issues hey everyone,  ive been trying to get a new laptop for quite some time and as we all know, we get caught up in the specs sometime. well, anyway, my laptop was supposed to be used to do video editing on the go and at work. i also have a desktop at home which i can transfer back and forth to do some more heavy lifting if needed.  so this brings me to my selections, i ended up going with the xps 15 for the graphics card and the slimness. decided at first to get a fhd+ i7 model with 16gb and 512. it runs great and lasted me throughout my work day which is a ten hour day on light duty. i decided i can sacrifice some more battery and go for the oled and sprung for the i9. with the 1tb and 32gb of ram.  i will tell you this - it has been a headache the entire time since i started it up. id get the bsod during initial startup for power failure. then the computer restarts and then the trackpad freezes. when that happens the touch screen no longer works. i figured that it just needed some updates, so after updating, same issue would arise repeatedly. i would then restart the computer and it would fix itself. i would navigate the computer by just using the keyboard to reset the laptop to try and fix the issue. i cant believe that i am having so many issues with the laptop right out of the box. i can see why people like macs. it just works right outside of the box with little fanfare. i just like using windows and its just so damn hard to find good quality laptops that makes little sacrifices.  i know mac are slow on implementing things and charge higher prices, but when they execute the product, they definitely execute it well. i really like the xps because its upgradeable, but the i9 is just riddled with issues right out of the box. sorry for the rant.',\n",

(by the way, i am not getting any of the 0.4ghz throttling issues as others have reported, this is likely because of the ufd reinstall i performed). the i5 1240p model can sustain 35w @ 2.3ghz, in cinebench r23. it consistently scored 9200-9300 sustained for some time; however, after about 17 runs, it throttles down to 28w and fluctuates between the upper and lower 8000s. this, of course, comes at the cost of extreme heat. it gets hot on the bottom of the laptop, and you wouldnt want to put that on your lap. though, the heat felt on the keyboard deck is much more manageable and gets warm but not as bad as the bottom casing. during the 25 runs of the cinebench r23 torture test i ran the xps 13 plus through, i noticed the fans started making a weird noise. and it appears the fans were scraping along the bottom metal cover or at least against something. curious, i also tried applying pressure on the bottom cover which temporarily caused a fan to stop spinning for a second or so. this is concerning. another issue was coil whine, which i noticed a little bit, however, it was mostly quiet. what drove me to a headache was this other strange sound while running tests, high-pitched in the background of the fan noise. i wasnt sure what this was exactly. maybe it was the coil whine getting worse? despite all the advertising that dell tells you about performance, the xps 13 plus is not meant to be a performance laptop, at least with long extensive workloads. short bursts of power needed are probably definitely fine on this laptop. capacitive touch function row? no problems with it, in my opinion. as a touch typist, i think the keyboard is great, and you can easily get used to it within a couple of hours of use or so. the keys dont take much actuation force, and it feels like they are higher travel than they are. the trackpad is mostly good. however, i have one annoying thing with palm rejection. my hand would rest on the area where the right click would be, and clicking on the left side of the trackpad would trigger the right click. another minor caveat was slight inconsistency with how the haptics felt in different locations on the trackpad, though, i didnt find it to be a big deal. after using it for a while, i dont think you need any indication or markings of where the trackpad is, just like dell claims. your muscle memory will work it out. its not on par with apples macbooks which have a more satisfying click; however, this is not too far behind. build quality is pretty good in general, except for the flexing of the bottom metal cover. windows central reported on chassis flex causing the fans to scrape against the bottom, and i have also noticed this same issue (mentioned in the performance section earlier). battery life isnt something i can say about yet, considering ive only used this for a couple of hours. but other people have said it isnt that great due to alderlake. i want to like this laptop. honestly now, im very disappointed with this purchase. even though i got it for a cheaper price, i still pretty much regret this decision because of dells horrifying quality control. i might go out and buy the macbook air m2 in hopes of better quality assurance from apple as well as a solid build and battery life. the thinkpad z13 might be nice (if i can get myself to not care about the plastic bezels on its matte display compared to integrated bezels on the xps 13 plus), and the slim 7 pro x is also a good deal at costco right now. edit: this is an image of the display gap: https://imgur.com/a/6af1de. also getting graphics driver issues when i tried loading minecraft. the trackpad is also making random clicking noises when not touching it sometimes. theres also another clicking sound when holding the laptop at some angles but i dont know what is causing that. i can confirm the high-pitched noise is very likely the coil whine getting worse when pushing the laptop.',\n",

       " 'xps 15 9520 washed out colors - fix i recently got an xps 15 9520 refurbished with the oled panel. however, from the first day, i noticed my colors were washed out in many conditions. there were many things i found online, but none of those worked or were applicable, so heres how i fixed it for future reference. let me know if theres another or a better way: 1. turn off hdr initially, i turned hdr on to try it out, maybe it would make things look better; the screen supported it, so why not try. however, for my normal non-hardcore-photo-editor uses, all it did was make the screen blank out for a second when the charger was plugged in and make the colors look washed out. dell support also acknowledges this as a \"solution\" here. 2. set srgb as default profile turning off hdr solved the system-wide problem, however it still seemed like many apps (discord, firefox top bar, vscode) still seemed washed out. after going down many forum rabbit holes, i think i fixed it. go to start menu->search and click \"color management\". then click add->\"srgb iec61966-2.1\". then click on the color profile you just added and press \"set as default profile\" in the bottom right. then reopen apps to make the changes take effect. things that seemed to work: 1. turning off hardware acceleration when i was in the process of troubleshooting, a certain forum rabbit hole (i forgot exactly where) suggested this. turning off hardware acceleration in apps seemed to fix it, but its a bit tedious doing this on every app that you install. this also led me to another solution through more searching: 2. force srgb in every app if an app supports it, like most browsers or vscode, forcing srgb fixed the tissue for that app. however, this was also tedious to do for everything. in conclusion: i dont know if my laptop was actually defective and this was like putting bandaids on it, or if this is how its intended to be, but it kinda sucks that i had to do this for a brand new >$1k laptop. anyways, hope this helped someone else with the same problem, let me know if theres a better way to fix this.',\n",

at this point, my client has been without the laptop since may and now dell support is refusing to replace the computer and im not sure what the next steps are but my client doesnt want anything to do with this defective laptop. since purchasing: the screen has been replaced one time. the motherboard has been replaced twice. the trackpad has been replaced one time. now they want to replace the hard-drive... the warranty expires in november. ive presented this issue to dell as being a common issue with the dell xps 9510 but they refuse to acknowledge that its an inherent issue: https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ie/000188375/blue-screen-drive-power-state-failure-or-system-lagging-in-the-os-environment https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/636 https://ask.fedoraproject.org/t/intermittent-touchpad-lag-with-dell-xps-9510/15645/2 https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=269951 https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/oqdh4l/xps_15_9510_mouse_keyboard_lag/ https://www.dell.com/community/xps/xps-15-9570-mouse-keyboard-lag-repeating-keys/td-p/7235707 https://www.dell.com/community/xps/xps-15-9500-video-stutter/td-p/7738542 https://www.reddit.com/r/dellxps/comments/r5ev1n/has_anyone_else_gotten_ghost_clicks_and_random/ https://www.reddit.com/r/dellxps/comments/p7q9m3/dell_xps_9510_mouse_and_keyboard_bluetooth_lag/ https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/jw60pr/xps_15_9500_extreme_frame_dropping_and_stuttering/ https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/jytgsu/xps_15_9500_2020_sudden_lag_stutter_and_fps_drop/ if anyone has any suggestions, i am all ears. thank you!',\n",

       " 'brand new dell xps 9720 battery drain issues, help! this issue has been driving me crazy for the last week and all i want is my laptop to work properly. everything was working fine until i noticed very recently that the fans were kicking in much more than usual, as well as the battery life dropping from 6-7 hours down to 2. i used hwinfo to view the battery drain to find that it’s constantly draining between 30-40w at all times. the laptop also remains hot and fans do not ever spin down. this also includes when inside the bios, the fans spin to max and the laptop gets hot while just sitting on the bios homepage. i’ve tried reinstalling windows, reinstalling a previous bios update, reinstalling gpu drivers etc. i cannot figure out what is causing this issue!! the thing that also drives me crazy is that i managed to find a temporary fix by accident, the problem goes away completely if i use the “restart” option. after a restart, drain drops to 5-12w and battery life goes back to 6-8 hours. however using shutdown, hibernate, or sleep all result in the issue returning…! any help or ideas for diagnosing this issue would be appreciated, my current theory is that something is keeping the 3060 gpu running at all times but if that is the case why is it running in the bios? and why does a restart fix it…?! this is an amazing laptop but the issue is really getting on my nerves.',\n",

       " 'other[inconclusive experiment] xps 17 9700 with a tb18dc cable on a tb16 i have an xps 17 9700 and a tb16 dock. the 9700 is infamous for its battery drain under load when plugged in. i managed to borrow a tb18dc dock cable (just the cable) for the weekend. i wanted to see if i can convert my tb16 to a tb18 and maybe get the 210w charging that the tb18 offers. i know im not the only one who has thought about this, so this is for anyone else digging into the matter. to my knowledge, the 16 and 18 are identical hardware-wise except for the cable that plugs into the laptop. although it explicitly states that the 18 only works on a specific pair of 7k precisions i figured i might as well give it a bash and see what happens. i didnt even know if the cable would fit on a 9700 as it doesnt split like a wd19dc does. i remember reading on some obscure datasheet / marketing bumf that the connectors were 16.2mm centre to centre. i measured my 9700 with a pair of callipers and it was close enough. it ended up fitting perfectly when i plugged in. its either a lucky coincidence (re-used twin-port design from other models?) or they might have considered making the laptop compatible early in the design stage and then decided otherwise. either way, the cable fit perfectly at both ends (dock and laptop), so i went on to power everything on. this is pretty much where everything hit a snag. the laptop wasnt happy with the dock. sometimes it would complain about the power input and disable charging, sometimes it would only charge at 60w. i tried all the ports except the vga (i dont own a vga cable) and not a single one worked. the dock didnt even show up in the thunderbolt control centre. as far as i can work out, all the drivers between the 16 and 18 are the same. the only difference was the firmware. now, i dont know if the firmware is actually different or whether the same file had different names based on the dock page you downloaded it from, but i didnt want to try my luck. i have a unicorn 16 that works pretty well, i didnt want to risk bricking it with firmware. thats why this whole experiment was inconclusive. i didnt have an 18 to test with, just the cable. so, if anyone reading this has access to a tb18dc and an xps 17 (im guessing the 9710 and 20 would also fit the cable), could you please give it a go and reply back with the results, im really curious if it works. i dont want to spend some £50 buying an 18 for an experiment that might not work.',\n",

       " 'dell xps 9520 touchscreen registry settings to improve responsiveness hey everyone, ive ran into issues with my dell xps 9520 and touch screen reliability. ive fought with this issue quite a bit and have learned from registry tweaks that made significant improvements in touch screen responsiveness. thought i would share these in case other 9520 users were having the same problem. my problem: i was experiencing was erroneous double tap and pinch to zoom gestures that were being registered by the touch screen even though i was just doing normal taps and scrolling with one finger. im not sure if this was unique to my laptop, unique to my fingertips, or other environmental conditions like humidity, but that was what i was running into. basically while scrolling a document it would suddenly zoom out 50% or would bring up the context menu because i thought i had done a double press (which maps to a right click). it was very intrusive and made the touch screen essentially unusable. the fix: i had dell service replaced the display thinking that there was something wrong with the manufacturing of the digitizer layer. a new display had exactly the same behavior. eventually, i edited a few registry settings within microsoft touchprediction which have helped it significantly and made it almost completely usable without too many mis-presses. its now about 98% accurate with the fingerpresses whereas before it was like 80% accurate. registry updates: the 2 settings i changed were under: computer\\\\hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\touchprediction the default latency and sampletime were both 8 i changed latency=1 and sampletime = 0x40 (64 decimal value). you can play around with these numbers and find an optimal setting. i found that decreasing the latency and increasing sampletime worked the best in the end. initially, i had decreased both values to 2. this was what had been recommended by other online forms, but i did find my values to work the best for the laptop. they did say that decreasing these values may negatively impact battery life, i didnt notice this for me but i have such different workloads throughout the day that i could never feel the impact of battery life. hope this helps someone out there.',\n",

       " 'xps 15 9520 - solving the power throttling hello! ive spent far too much time trying to solve the xps 15 9520s power throttling under combined cpu + gpu loads (specifically, the cpu dropping to <15w and sub-1ghz while gaming), so ive decided to share my solution around to hopefully help other owners out. video here [this is - by far - better than the text version, imo] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r3wshdqsvy tl:dw? ...no, the text version is a little long too, but here you go: you’ll need to download a copy of throttlestop to carry out the steps to control power throttling. download here: https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/ please note that throttlestop settings are reset when the system is power cycled so you’ll need to reopen the app after starting up the system to make sure they’re applied. alternatively, you can set up task scheduler to automatically run the program on login. firstly, a quick warning. the xps 9520 has introduced a sheet of plastic sandwiched between the heatsink assembly and the motherboard. based on my own testing, this is a thermal insulator, which has most likely been placed there to reduce the temperature of the bottom case by a few degrees. this could have been ok, except the plastic is actually directly covering the mosfets for the cpu and gpu voltage regulators. on my unit, the poor application of this plastic sheet had pushed the thermal pad for the gpu mosfets up and away from what it was supposed to be cooling. not good. the thermal pads on the rear of the cooler are supposed to be making direct, uninterrupted contact with the parts they are intended to cool. dell’s decision to shove an insulating layer in between is bafflingly ill-advised, but with the standard heavy power throttling behaviour intact, it’s still likely that mosfet temperatures are remaining within their rated limits. i’m not necessarily going to recommend tearing your brand new computer apart just to remove this plastic, but i will warn you that i don’t know what the long-term effect of running the cpu and gpu at full wattage will be on those mosfets with the plastic still in place. it is completely fair to assume that it won’t be good for them. please keep in mind that i have removed the plastic from this xps and repasted the chips with kryonaut before making any changes to the behaviour of the power delivery. the first and most important thing you need to know is that the xps can’t adequately cool itself while sitting flat on a hard or soft surface. the gpu is set to start thermal throttling at only 74 degrees, so even after following all the steps in this video, you’ll see the rtx 3050 throttling like crazy almost immediately if the laptop isn’t elevated on a ventilated stand or cooling pad. a fairly unusual feature in many of dell’s products is motion-based power throttling. this uses an accelerometer embedded in the intel chipset to tell the machine when it’s been picked up or moved, and a hard power throttle will kick in on both the cpu and gpu which can take quite a while to go away. to sort this out, head into device manager. expand the sub-section called system devices. now, locate “intel integrated sensor solution”. right click on this, then click on disable device. when prompted, click on yes. it’s best to restart the computer now to make sure this takes effect. right, let’s tackle that power throttling. assuming you haven’t removed the plastic from underneath the cooling solution, the following is (i believe) the best course of action: first up, we’re going to get the power delivery under control while keeping temperatures as low as possible. please use this method if you haven’t removed the insulating plastic from under

       " 'xps helpxps 15 9520 - solving the throttling hello! ive spent far too much time trying to solve the xps 15 9520s power throttling under combined cpu + gpu loads (specifically, the cpu dropping to <15w and sub-1ghz while gaming), so ive decided to share my solution around to hopefully help other owners out. video here [this is - by far - better than the text version, imo] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r3wshdqsvy tl:dw? ...no, the text version is a little long too, but here you go: you’ll need to download a copy of throttlestop to carry out the steps to control power throttling. download here: https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/ please note that throttlestop settings are reset when the system is power cycled so you’ll need to reopen the app after starting up the system to make sure they’re applied. alternatively, you can set up task scheduler to automatically run the program on login. firstly, a quick warning. the xps 9520 has introduced a sheet of plastic sandwiched between the heatsink assembly and the motherboard. based on my own testing, this is a thermal insulator, which has most likely been placed there to reduce the temperature of the bottom case by a few degrees. this could have been ok, except the plastic is actually directly covering the mosfets for the cpu and gpu voltage regulators. on my unit, the poor application of this plastic sheet had pushed the thermal pad for the gpu mosfets up and away from what it was supposed to be cooling. not good. the thermal pads on the rear of the cooler are supposed to be making direct, uninterrupted contact with the parts they are intended to cool. dell’s decision to shove an insulating layer in between is bafflingly ill-advised, but with the standard heavy power throttling behaviour intact, it’s still likely that mosfet temperatures are remaining within their rated limits. i’m not necessarily going to recommend tearing your brand new computer apart just to remove this plastic, but i will warn you that i don’t know what the long-term effect of running the cpu and gpu at full wattage will be on those mosfets with the plastic still in place. it is completely fair to assume that it won’t be good for them. please keep in mind that i have removed the plastic from this xps and repasted the chips with kryonaut before making any changes to the behaviour of the power delivery. the first and most important thing you need to know is that the xps can’t adequately cool itself while sitting flat on a hard or soft surface. the gpu is set to start thermal throttling at only 74 degrees, so even after following all the steps in this video, you’ll see the rtx 3050 throttling like crazy almost immediately if the laptop isn’t elevated on a ventilated stand or cooling pad. a fairly unusual feature in many of dell’s products is motion-based power throttling. this uses an accelerometer embedded in the intel chipset to tell the machine when it’s been picked up or moved, and a hard power throttle will kick in on both the cpu and gpu which can take quite a while to go away. to sort this out, head into device manager. expand the sub-section called system devices. now, locate “intel integrated sensor solution”. right click on this, then click on disable device. when prompted, click on yes. it’s best to restart the computer now to make sure this takes effect. right, let’s tackle that power throttling. assuming you haven’t removed the plastic from underneath the cooling solution, the following is (i believe) the best course of action: first up, we’re going to get the power delivery under control while keeping temperatures as low as possible. please use this method if you haven’t removed the insulating plastic from under your heatsink assembly. as you may be aware, these systems feature nvidia dynamic boost, which shifts power from the cpu over to the gpu depending on load. we’re going to disable this feature to lock the graphics chip at 35 watts of power, down from the maximum of 45 watts it will use from the factory. the effect on temperatures is significant. jump back into device manager. open the sub-section

       " 'xps 13 9310, turbo boost status cannot be changed in bios hello to everyone. i want to share how i managed to enable/disable intel turbo boost (for those facing issues with this). first some introduction with my case. i have 2pcs dell xps 13 9310. first one doesn’t have any issues with disabling/enabling all functions possible inside bios (current bios version 3.7.0). when i bought the second unit first thing i did was to upgrade all drivers and bios as well. my current bios version is 3.7.0 and system is running on windows 11 pro. as the issue (which officially as per dell is not an issue but i am really in doubt about this) of the flashing charging light when the laptop is connected to charger and turbo boost kick in is really annoying i wanted to disable turbo boost from bios. and then i realized that it is not possible and when i toggle it \"off\" it returns to \"on\" position again. in fact, after spending some time inside bios, i have noticed that as well is not possible to change the options of \"intel speedstep\", \"c-state control\", \"intel hyper-threading technology\" and \"intel virtualization technology\" (maybe i am missing some other option as well). as my other unit does not have these problems i have started searching in internet if there is any solution. as i saw - there was none. after some bios update onward these options could not be changed. this get us to the solution which accidentally i have found that worked for me and i hope can be helpful for someone else as well. i have downloaded different old bios versions (3.6.0, 3.4.0 and 3.2.0) from dell site and tried downgrade the bios by executing the downloaded \"exe\" file from windows. i have noticed that during the downgrading of the bios everything went normal except when \"sending intel(r) management engine firmware update\" process was completed after it appeared message \"me firmware downgrade was not allowed\" and then \"me update failed\". maybe this is the reason why after the downgrade process is completed and windows is started in the notification panel appears message that restart is required in order to finish with the update of bios 3.7.0. once the system is restarted automatically bios update is performed and bios is reverted back to my current version 3.7.0. and finally we are getting to the moment how i have managed to disable/enable turbo boost. the only bios version that has worked for me was 3.2.0. so, i have started downloaded xps_13_9310_3.2.0.exe from dell site and restarted the system. downgrade process started and again \"me update failed\" appeared. once the downgrade was completed and system automatically restarted before windows is booted by pressing f2 i went into the bios. and now the options which was not able to be changed (including turbo boost) now already was possible to toggle on/off. i have disabled turbo boost, system restarted, windows loaded and message that restart is required in order to finish with the update of bios 3.7.0 appeared again. i have restarted the system, automatically bios update was performed and bios is reverted back to my current version 3.7.0. after this when i entered the bios the situation was again same as in the beginning - some options could not be changed. only that turbo boost have remained in off position. i have repeated the procedure (downgrading to 3.2.0 - after downgrade completed and system restarted before windows boot enter into the bios - change turbo boost setting - boot into windows - restart - automatic bios update performed) and it again worked - changed setting was saved. i hope above written could help to anyone and will be really great if someone experiencing the problem that cannot enable/disable intel turbo boost try it and give his feedback.',\n",

       " 'xps discussionnew xps 13 plus - business user review when deciding which laptop to get this year for work, i had a lot of requirements. due to the lack of data on the internet, there were some requirements that i took a gamble on when i ordered the new xps 13 plus. i am writing this post to cover my findings on those requirements now that i have had possession of the new xps 13 plus for several days. specs: i7 14 core 32 gb ram 1tb ssd fhd monitor dark grey os: windows - picked only because the configurator wouldnt allow me to pick the processor and ram combo with ubuntu  power cables: the included adapter works well but it is very dell specific. i found that my anker usb c chargers that are over 60w are working just as well as the factory charger. this is the same setup i had with my 2016 xps model. i also have a 100w anker usb c charger that powers my dock which charges the new xps as well. docks: i had a requirement of having 3 monitors (1080p) and so i wanted to try a new dock this year. i went with https://www.amazon.com/dp/b086dxlf37 and it has performed well. only issue with this dock is cable management. external monitors: i was unsure of how many monitors this new model would support. initially i was looking into dell models with dedicated graphics cards to support this requirement. i was very pleased to find out that with just one cable, i am able to get power into the xps from the dock while also pushing graphics to all three of my 1080p monitors. additionally, the laptop screen can also continue to be used which gives me a current total of 4 monitors to use. this was plug and play with no additional work needed. i am using the usbc port on the right hand side of the xps as i believe this one is more powerful. battery life with fhd screen: initially, i chose the oled screen but after seeing that most of the reviewers online received this model and had issues i went with the fhd screen. i wanted oled as it is simply beautiful however, i needed more than 4 hours of battery life. i am happy to report that after windows did its setup thing the first few days, i am easily getting over 8 hours of battery life with this setup. this is similar to my 2016 xps model. headphones and microphones: previously i had always preferred the apple wired headphones as they are cheap and have great quality. i am pleased to announce that these headphones work perfectly using the included usbc to headphone jack dongle from the xps box. fingerprint magnet: i knew this dark model would show some finger prints. i thought it would just show if my fingers were greasy, etc. i was way off. the dark model shows everything. literally everything you touch regardless of cleanliness, will show on this model. i feel disgusting and am constantly cleaning the device.  strength of body: i accidentally had my macbook pro 13 lightly touch the new xps 13 plus and although the macbook was completely unscratched, the xps now has a permanent scuff.  performance: this laptop is extremely powerful. i knew this would be a work horse, however i didnt quite anticipate just how powerful this setup would be. it has handled everything i have thrown at it while remaining faster than my t420 and r720 servers. i am impressed.  heat: performance always comes at the cost of heat management. with a laptop so small i knew it would get hot but i didnt know if it was still lap-able. i am pleased to report that even under tremendous load, i am still comfortable using the device in jeans. i will say that the home key row does get a bit toasty though under these conditions.  drivers: my model came with everything running well. the only drivers i needed to load were for a usb-a to ethernet dongle i had around the office. it was an apple dongle and so i just downloaded the bootcamp package and retrieved the drivers i needed.  context menus: this is more an issue with windows 11 than anything specific to the xps, but i struggled to get 7-zip to show in the right click menus. i eventually switched to nanazip and followed their directions. https://github.com/m2team/nanazip  hello and finger print on domain users: another windows 11 issue. i was unable to get hello and finger print to work with my user tied to my work domain. i couldnt figure it out for days and then stumbled on an article that explained that this is not supposed to work on domains but you can make it work through a registry edit. basically you have to enable pin login for domain users and then hello and finger print just work after that: https://www.technipages.com/windows-11-fingerprint-option-is-currently-unavailable  wsl2 update errors: coming from the xps developer edition to a windows device i knew that wsl2 was going to be huge for me. on initial setup, everything was good but then i couldnt run \"sudo apt install ...\" without failures to connect. after much troubleshooting i found that my companys antivirus was blocking the connection so once we got that sorted and made sure the windows firewall was setup correctly, we were back in business.  overall: i am overall extremely impressed with this laptop. a few learning points but i highly recommend it non-the-less. i am writing this in hopes that it helps others with similar requirements.',\n",

       " '[guide] 2022 xps 15/17 - windows 11 clean install checklist hello beautiful people! ive noticed several threads with people struggling to clean-install windows 11 properly and easily. heres a best-effort guide to all steps i have taken to get a bloat-free and compromise-free windows 11 experience. note: i have an xps 15 9520 (and an older 9500). the guide is written for the 9520 but should apply to the xps 17 9700/9710/9720 and perhaps even the xps 13 (9300/9310/9320).  phase 1: preparations youll need at least an 8gb usb drive, and a usb-a to usb-c adapter (if your usb drive is not type c).  download the windows 11 media creation tool: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295 plug in your usb drive run the windows 11 media creation tool follow the instructions, select your usb drive and let it do its thing. note: i would recommend getting all updates. download the intel rst driver (vmd): intel® rapid storage technology driver installation software with intel® optane™ memory (10th and 11th gen platforms) put it in a folder at the root of the usb drive. well need this later. download the ax211 drivers and extract them to the root of your usb drive: https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/n3ciw08w.exe note: i used the ax211 wireless lan drivers from the lenovo site because its got an easy \"extract only\" option when you run it. it shouldnt matter as we can overwrite this with the dell/intel drivers later. copy your c:/windows/system21/oem folder to a separate folder on your usb drive  phase 2: installation  reboot the laptop press f12 as it boots up to get to the one-time boot menu select the usb drive to start the installation note: if youre facing issues booting from the usb drive, check your boot order settings. you should not need to change anything in order to get it working if youre using the default settings. restore defaults if in doubt. once booted from the usb drive, the windows 11 installation wizard will start. first, you need to set the language, time, and keyboard. once done, click on the ‘next’ button. on the next page, click on the ‘install now’ option. when selecting the type of installation, click custom to clean the disk and install an absolutely fresh copy of windows 11. now, if youre using a stock laptop, its set to raid mode by default, and the raid drivers are not a part of the standard windows 11 installation package. thats why we downloaded the irst drivers earlier. click on load drivers browse to the folder where your irst drivers were added. you need to select the intel rst vmd controller 9a08 (tgl) driver and press next to install it. your drives should have instantly appeared. i would recommend formatting only the large os partition and leaving the recovery partition alone in case we ever want to easily go back to the stock os without using the dell recovery iso download tool. proceed with the installation. restart the computer. go through the basic setup, and when you get to the stage where you need to select a wifi network, you may not be seeing any networks. this is because the ax211 wifi driver may not be a part of your installation media package. press shift + f10 to open the setup diagnostic command prompt type wmic logicaldisk get deviceid, volumename, description to get the drive letter for your usb drive. type pnputil /install x:\\\\*.inf /install (replace x with your usbs drive letter). this will add and install all the drivers in the root of your usb drive (the wifi drivers). the wifi networks should appear now.  phase 3: debloating (optional, but recommended) i followed and would recommend this guide for debloating: github - theworldofpc/windows11-debloat-privacy-guide i used the debloat everything except microsoft store & xbox option. because i want this functionality and because without the microsoft store, several key features of the laptop may not work as intended (such as dobly vision, hevc videos, dell power manager, dell premiercolor, etc.) you can also go through the guide and manually debloat what you want to instead of using the script.  phase 4: getting essential dell drivers and apps now that we have an absolutely clean version of windows, lets start adding a little bit of the xps personality back into the os. enabling dell-only oem apps to be downloaded from the microsoft store: run these two commands in an admin command prompt: reg add \"hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\currentversion\\\\store\" /v oemid /f /t reg_sz /d dell reg add \"hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\currentversion\\\\store\" /v storecontentmodifier /f /t reg_sz /d dell_xps restart your pc (this is important) run the command in an admin cmd to reset the store: wsreset adding oem-specific information to windows and dell logo to boot screen: remember the oem folder you copied in phase 1? paste it back into c:/windows/system32/ restart the system install the following drivers from dells support site for your particular model: intel chipset drivers intel chipset device software driver intel management engine components installer intel serial io driver intel hid event filter driver intel thunderbolt controller driver intel dynamic tuning driver intel integrated sensor solution driver graphics drivers intel nvidia audio drivers media card reader driver fingerprint sensor driver install the following apps from the microsoft store: my dell (optional, for the power/thermal settings and quick access to device data) - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9pn7t3jfprz6 dolby vision extensions - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9pltg1lwphlf waves maxxaudio pro for dell 2022 - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9pht5d9mm13d dell premiercolor - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9n9pjgjg009k vp9 video extensions - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9n4d0msmp0pt hevc video extensions from device manufacturer - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9n4wgh0z6vhq dell update (optional) - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p6n2tp3xvkn dell supportassist (optional, not really recommended) - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9n4cgr6r7pt1 dell power manager (optional and recommended if you didnt get my dell): https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9pd11rq8qc9k thats it! congratulations, youre now running a fresh, clean copy of windows 11 that youre certain is set up just the way you want it to: with maximum security, performance, and, best of all, no compromises! feel free to ask any questions, provide any suggestions, and let me know if ive done anything incorrectly. ill try to keep this thread updated with the best feedback! best! jabberwocky',\n",
       " 'dell xps 13 plus developer edition review i really struggled to find any significant reviews on this device on windows, let alone on linux. i took a risk ordering it, and im going to be using it over the next few days and updating this review with more information. im going to focus mostly on things that are objective and not subjective (e.g. no excessive commentary on whether the capacitive touch bar is good or bad). for reference, i have owned: 2021 asus rog zephyrus g14 2018 macbook pro 13 starlabs labtop mk iv thinkpad p15 and various other, older laptops. ive used linux on all of them except the macbook pro. i honestly cant compare any functionality to windows as i dont use it and havent booted windows is many years. specs i ordered the 1200p touch, i7-1260p, 32gb ram and 1tb hdd. i ordered the developer edition, so it came with ubuntu. i briefly checked functionality on that before replacing it with arch. note: on arch everything works except the webcam. (and possibly the fingerprint reader, untested on any platform). on ubuntu, the webcam did work and seemed pretty decent. most of the reviews were complaining about it, but it seemed fully acceptable to me. as the webcam doesnt work on arch i cant do any further testing related to it at the moment. ** update day... 6? **i noticed for the first time today that the integrated microphone array in the webcam also doesnt work. this makes sense. its more annoying than the webcam not working, though. itll likely motivate me to get the driver kernel modules compiled. screen its great. on par with my macbook. my untrained eyes cant see a difference. i dont have any objective measuring tools, but it definitely seems to be 500 nits as rated based on comparisons with the 350 nit g14. at around 50% brightness, its very usable in a brightly lit room. i am a software developer and i find the resolution to be perfect. 16:10 is superior for the trade and the text is crisp at this screen size. contrast is really good -- much better than any laptop ive used aside from the macbook (and not noticeably worse than that). on ubuntu, auto screen brightness worked. i havent gotten it working yet on arch, but will update when/if i do. i rarely use the touch feature, but it works. ** update from day 8 ** i got auto brightness working. i thought (incorrectly) that the brightness sensor may be part of the camera array, and thus i couldnt get it working without the webcam bus drivers in the kernel. anyway, i installed autolight from the aur and then changed `/etc/autolight/config` to point to `alp_device=/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1/in_illuminance_raw` instead of the default (device:0) and it works fine. keyboard it did take some getting used to, but now that i am used to it, it is fast. it has a distinct click but it is not overly loud, just tactile. after about 4 hours i am now perfectly comfortable on it. my only complaint is the tiny up/down arrows. i would have preferred a smaller right shift key and slightly smaller left/right arrows. i bought the platinum/white version. the backlight is... annoying. in good lighting, it reduces the visibility of the key caps, not increases. the backlight isnt overly bright, which is good in the dark but if you just like having a backlit keyboard even during the day, this doesnt get bright enough and the keycaps become poorly visible when the backlight is on. this is similar to the g14 experience (also white). brief note on the touch bar -- i was never overly bothered by the mac touch bar. if you were, this will likely bother you. its basically the same. it would have helped if theyd just added small ribs between the touch keys for tactile placement, but theres no distinction between one \"key\" to the next. i use emacs and not vim so i dont rely overly on escape. the delete key is large enough that its very difficult to miss. i use the function row a lot and thats what my fingers miss more than anything. ** update from day 2 ** the touch bar is getting a little annoying. i dont miss keys often -- its more annoying because the \"keys\" are so large and a soft touch triggers them. so, if i have my finger resting near the tilde/grave key, i might hit escape by accident -- just a touch and it triggers. not the end of the world, but it is annoying when it happens. touchpad the touchpad is perfectly fine. i personally havent had any issues using it. on ubuntu for whatever reason, two-finger click didnt work. i dont use ubuntu, so that might be normal. on arch/gnome, all gestures and multi finger clicks work as expected. the haptics feel great. i dont notice that the pad doesnt actually click. ** update from day 3 **there are some annoyances with the touch pad not physically clicking -- mostly when i need to click, hold and drag. since there is no actual depression, it is not super intuitive to know how hard to keep pressing while dragging. this can be fixed by enabling alternative touch pad schemes (e.g. tap to click), but it is a compromise and will take getting used to. i dont really click and drag all that often but you might have different requirements. battery this is what i couldnt find much good data on. some reviews said that the 12th gen power consumption was terrible, others said it was better. im coming from a ryzen 5000 laptop (the g14). i have tlp installed and havent done anything else special. its okay. a little worse than i would like, but not bad. i tried a few different scenarios for an hour or two each: \"office\" communication -- email, slack, jira/confluence, web browsing. in an hour, i had 89% battery, so i would expect around 9-10 hours of this. electron apps arent extremely efficient, so if you use native apps, it might perform slightly better. development. this was in emacs, with lsp and gopls (golang), as well as intelliphense (php). also still involved slack, web, etc. brief compilation, lots of git operations. this had me at 90% after 48 minutes, so i would expect around 7-8 hours of this. heavy docker work. starting and stopping many containers several times (40-60 containers, 5-6 times) in addition to some development work. this had me down to 79% in 1 hour and 20 minutes. the docker spikes would really drain battery -- disabling turbo boost helped. sixish hours of this expected. all core heavy load. i didnt do this for long, but i would expect around 1 hour max from this. disabling turbo on battery is strongly recommended unless youre near an outlet. overall, compared to my g14, it gets slightly longer battery life. maybe 15% more. a little underwhelming, considering the g14 is a gaming laptop with a higher power/tdp cpu (rated, anyway). it definitely gets better battery life on the lighter loads. i would basically never see my g14 exceed 7 hours of any real use, but i think in office tasks, especially if minimal web browsing was involved, the xps would last 9-10. most of the duration, screen brightness was roughly 50%, which is sufficient for indoor, brightly lit but no direct sunlight. estimates are from 100% to 0%. **update from day 2** battery life continues to be about what i mentioned above. however, i think my development estimate was a little low -- im getting about 8-8.5 hours of battery life today. ive been light on actual development due to need to do research and running into some issues. hopefully tomorrow ill have some heavier development with more frequent compilation and more intense ide interactions. of note, this entire time my applications test environment has been running (43 docker containers). its mostly idle, but not completely, so thats adding some additional battery drain). overall, for days when compilation of code is light, or for more dynamic languages with no formal compilation step, 8 hours seems a reasonable expectation so far for battery life. ** update from day 3 ** different power managers (e.g. tlp versus power-profiles-daemon) seem to make no significant difference. balanced vs power saver makes a slight difference, maybe 30-60 minutes on a full battery. ill be attempting to fine tune this over time to see what can get the best results with the least detriment to performance. ** update from day 8 ** after resuming from sleep, twice now, the upower service has completely stopped polling the battery consumption. this causes the battery percentage to never change and it also (seems to) cause the battery life to be a bit worse. hopefully its fixed in a future update soon because its rather annoying. in other news, for reasons i cant track down, sometimes i get 8-8.5 hours while developing and others im lucky to get 7, more like 6.5. i dont have anything obviously different running, but something is obviously making a large difference. im going to try to isolate it. performance 12 cores is very nice for my workload, which is docker heavy and high thread count matters, just like in sheets. its still early (ill update this post periodically over the next week or so) but it seems to perform about as well as my g14 despite being on a lower tdp (but who knows if thats really true, intels tdp is all over the place). if you want a particular benchmark, i can run it, lmk. (as long as its free). i can compile anything that is relatively straightforward (go, rust, javascript/node). ** update from day 4 ** still happy with the performance. i havent noticed anything where i thought \"wow, this is definitely slower than my previous laptop (g14).\" the exception is of course gaming. i tried a game today -- planet zoo. this ran at 800p and mostly low settings at 50-60 fps. it didnt look fantastic but it was playable. screen tearing was present, even with vsync enabled (this might be fixable by setting the monitor to 30 fps to lower the fps limit). its not a gaming laptop so this is understandable, but casual games like that are fully playable (planet zoo is a fairly demanding \"casual\" game, too). if anyone has any other questions, feel free to ask! ill do my best to answer.',\n",

(of course it was suddenly available) technician arrives, he was a wonderful person, and sat down and disassembled the laptop in about 20 minutes, until he got to the motherboard where he found out a handful of the screws were stripped and he was worried that if he got them out he would make them worse. so he escalated to a send in repair. after about a week of waiting i get the box and send it into the service center. about 3 days later i received the laptop, and the palmrest was seemingly replaced as it had a plastic cover on it. i flip the laptop over, install my upgraded ram, and when installing it, i now notice, not only the previous stripped screws were still installed, but all of the screws holding the battery in are also now stripped. no big deal in the end to me. i flipped the laptop back over, removed the plastic cover, and to no surprise, the track pad was almost exactly as i had sent it in, raised above the palm rest. it seems like they potentially tried to push the trackpad down, or whatever replacement part was also defective. so i immediately hopped back on support and reported it again. this time they escalated it to the exchange team almost immediately. the exchange team reached back out to me with a decently speccd system, for all intents and purposes, it was an upgrade. 32gb vs the 16 and a 2tb vs the 1tb in my original spec, but i had already upgraded those myself on my previous system, so it wasnt a value to me, but the issue was it wasnt in white. sure, this is a bit of a first world problem, but i specifically sought out and bought a white one because that is the one i wanted, so i replied stating i have a white one and this was a black one and 24hours later i got an email stating the replacement we have is silver exterior with blank interior do you accept? i replied with my obvious frustration, especially since all of this has built up for so long at this point, and stating those two upgrades are unnecessary for me, i would even take a downgrade to a 512gb white one if they could just get me that model. no response for the rest of the day, and then a response on monday stating that the white one i saw was no longer available, that the one they were offering me already has upgraded memory and ram so i wouldnt need to use mine that i bought separately. i replied saying, if i were to take this model, i would like to talk about having a new warranty instead of the month ive lost dealing with this already, and get it overnighted to me since that is what the support rep said they could do. no response for two days, until i push for some sort of update. finally get a response saying that the white one is still unavailable(didnt ask but okay at least they are trying), and that if i wanted to do warranty transfers i would have to open a separate support ticket????, and that my case is now marked as priority response, but that the previous rep miscommunicated on the ability to overnight i said fine ill take the offered one and deal with the warranty stuff myself, but this is now at least the second miscommunication during this whole process. come three hours later i get a response saying that the originally offered model was no longer available to be processed and i was offered two different models. turns out, the day there was no response, the unit wasnt held for my replacement and was sold. so, the two new models i was being offered was an arctic white unit or a black interior, 3050(not ti) 1200p non touch model as my two options. i then realized that the arctic white one they were offering me was the scratch and dent model i had seen on their refurb site earlier in the day, since it was no longer listed. obviously, neither of these two models are valid replacements at this point, especially since it was a significant downgrade (over $500 cheaper) for the black unit, and the white one was scratch and dent. i pushed back a bit and asked if i can escalate it. i was told that it will take up to 48 to confirm escalation availability and then if i could escalate it to their manager then i would need to schedule out time to have the meeting. she also asked that i wait another 3-5 business days to see if they can find a replacement one that fits all the requirements, either a white one or a black one with the upgraded specs, since she said thats what her manager would suggest anyways.. this is currently where im sitting at with them and will update with more information as i get it. again, if this is no appropriate for this sub, please let me know and i will pull it down  update: 6/20 - they have offered me the same white one they offered before, that was potentially from their scratch and dent. i pushed back to see if they can provide me any more information about the device, like why it was a refurb, what happens if i receive it and it still has issues, and all that. since this is a spec for spec ( except for the fact it has win 10??? which i didnt even think these had an option to come with it ), replacement, they wont approve a refund or a new model until they attempt to send this one out.  update: 6/23 - received the white replacement. its actually in worse trackpad shape then before. the whole left side of the trackpad is above the palmrest instead of just the top left corner. so lets see what happens now  update: 6/24 - hopefully the last update in the saga. received a call from the corporate escalations team in regards to this. he noted all of my chat logs and all of my email interactions and has offered to give me a 9520 instead. interestingly enough, he noted the white ones currently are no longer being produced (delay or otherwise he wouldnt tell me) unfortunately he said it will take a couple weeks to get. this isnt what i was even asking for, i just wanted a working 9510 but i am grateful. im still wishy washy about buying future models from dell, but in the end they did make this one right in the long run. hopefully this new model comes in and has no issues. ill update as needed going forward.',\n",

       " 'reviewbought the xps 17 9710 ive been using the xps 17 9710 for two weeks now, and heres my thoughts on the same. for reference, here are my specs: i7 11800h, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd, rtx 3050 (60w), 1080p display. if theres anything i can say about this laptop, it has to be the build and design. the hinge is extremely sturdy, and it feels premium to the hand. love the soft carbon fiber layer on the inside, its very comfortable to rest my hands on. the keyboard itself is absolutely brilliant, and is one of the best on a laptop. even the track pad is excellent. its big and responsive, and feels much better to use than the ones on my previous laptops. however, there are some qc issues with it, though they seem to disappear when i use my laptop stand (i mostly use it with the stand and hence it isnt a problem for me. i couldnt fix it even if i wanted to, since i bought it in the us and im now back in india). the overall performance had been phenomenal, and i havent noticed any lag or other such issues. have played games like gta 5 and some others, and have got upwards of 60fps in most cases at 1080p ultra settings. this is good enough for me as im a casual gamer, but dont expect it to run at 4k with high settings and high fps. the biggest bonus i felt has been the thermals. i havent used it at ultra performance, since i havent needed it, but in any case the cooling has done its job. i previously owned a g3 and i have used an inspiron 16 plus regularly, and both of those run way hotter than the xps. even after a 2 hour gaming session, the gpu temp remained in the mid 60s, and even averaged 58 once with the ac on. it has been a very reliable laptop, and the vapor chamber has been key. i do have two shortcomings, though, which are the camera and the battery life. the camera is even worse than my old 700 dollar g3, which is frankly ridiculous given the price tag of the xps, however i can excuse it because the display is worth having a poor webcam. the battery life isnt bad, but i had expected more than the 5 hrs i get with light browsing and video streaming(50% brightness). overall, i think its been worth the extra money, given the performance, thermals and the form factor. heck its smaller than most of the 15 inch laptops ive used till date (mostly ones with thick bezels and none like the xps 15). if anyone is looking to buy one right now, id 100% recommend it. if you dont plan on using the extra horsepower, it may even be a better deal than the 9720. you cant really compare the xps 17 to any other laptop, since its in a marker segment of its own. its not as bulky as most gaming laptops, and yet its way more powerful than something like the 17inch lg gram. so in short, its a jack of all trades, which is perfect for someone like me. if youre confused between the 15 and 17, remember: 17 for thermals and power, 15 for slightly more portability. however, i would also say that if you just want performance and dont care about the premium build, there are better alternatives such as the zephyrus line that specialise in demanding tasks such as gaming. even the inspiron 16 plus is worth considering.',\n",
