      "content: hey all!some months ago, i decided to reinstall windows on my dell xps 15 9560 via the media creation tool - after that, i let dell automatically install all necessary drivers for my system via this link:https://www.dell.com/support/home/de-at/product-support/product/xps-15-9560-laptop/driversdoing so resulted in a continuous bsod a few seconds after booting the system - so i used the windows repair tool to roll back to a more stable state before installing the drivers. thus, i figured that the nvidia 1050 wasn't recognized by my system. i started updating the drivers manually from the nvidia website. no success, still bsod while installing the drivers after intense research, i found some possible solutions online:- installing drivers in safe mode- installing previous driver, bios and windows (like 23.21.13.8816, a13 and windows 10 1803)- using dell's usb-recovery-tool (which installs newest windows 10 and all drivers automatically)nothing worked!the only way to use my laptop is with a disabled gtx 1050 - which is no option for me i'm sure that my graphics card isn't defect, because after using dell's usb tool, the 1050 worked for some minutes before the system got instable and caused bsod.maybe i need to manually install all drivers in a specific order, with a specific bios and windows version?? any ideas?also, i would appreciate, if dell could help me out here  ... i already spent well above 40 hrs to find a solution. best,philip  hey @pheinrich ,this is probably the same bsod i posted about earlier in the year, and that a lot of people have been experiencing on the xps 15 9560.the fix for the rest of us is provided in the nvidia v526.47 drivers (direct from nvidia website, not dell supplied drivers).here's some links that'll explain the problems we've been have all year.my dell forum post accepted solution:https://www.dell.com/community/xps/dell-xps-15-9560-blue-screens/m-p/8296921/highlight/true#m104307another dell forum post with the same issue:https://www.dell.com/community/xps/dell-xps-15-9560-bsod/m-p/8237356#m100211a huge microsoft community post that someone from nvidia eventually noticed and responded to about the fix they did roll out for us very recently:https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/continued-bsod-video-dxgkrnl-fatal-error-windo... hei! thanks for ur fast response. i tried ur solution now - that doesnt seem to work either i even installled win11! in my device manager, the gtx 1050 is properly recognized - but doesnt work anywhere else ... no program can detect or use the gtx 1050 beside the device manager. my bios version: 1.24.0my windows version: win 11 22h2my gtx1050 driver version: 26.21.14.4270my intel hd graphics driver version: 27.20.100.9664 also, there are many undetected devices - but i dont think it has smth to do with my gpuyou should install the driver for intel hd graphics 630 before you install the nvidia driver. you could pause windows updates (or disable network connections, uninstall both nvidia and intel hd graphics drivers, reboot and then install intel hd graphics 630 driver followed by nvidia driver.have you attempted to follow dell's reimaging guide for the 9560? https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_laptop/esuprt_xps_laptop/xps-15-9560-laptop_a...sometimes you have to use the ddu,(display driver uninstall) program to really uninstall all of the driver.i'm using intel driver 27.20.100.9664 (a07) and nvidia ge force driver 31.0.15.1740 with no problems.it's been awhile but it seems like i had to boot in safe mode, run ddu on nvidia and intel then reboot.the intel driver has to be installed first and then the nvidia driver.  it's always a struggle to update them.you have to download the ddu driver, just google ddu, but be careful there are alot of fake download sites.here's an example i found to uninstall the intel driver.  the nvidia driver uninstalls the same way.steps to uninstall an intel graphics driver using display driver uninstaller (ddu).unable to determine how to uninstall igpu driver via display driver uninstaller (ddu) software.that did not work at all  i installed the newest version of the driver via nvidia website (528.02). it actually does install, but the gpu shows a warning sign and doesnt work. i attached some pictures below here's the analysis of the bsod when installing the suggested dell driver (from 2021)any other ideas? i alr removed any dust from the inside. is it likely that there's some kind of hardware problem with my gpu (which would be strange, as the bsod occours since the clean windows 10 installation)  best, philiphi philip, i started to experience the same issue with my xps 15 7590 after it updated to windows 11. everything is exactly as you explained above and none of the provided solutions worked so far. have you found out how to fix it?\n",

      "content: the keyboard on my new xps13 is very difficult to read in daylight. in the dark the backlight keys are ok but during the day the back lighting is not strong enough (even on the \"high\" setting) and the contrast between the light grey keys and the dark grey lettering is \"poor\". my old xps had black keys with bright white lettering; much better!!  i don't understand that a renowned company like dell can produce such poor design. don't they field test their products before hitting the market? i have exactly the same issue. it is a real problem in daylight. nighttime is fine, i wonder if there is anything that one can do to improve it?i had long conversations with dell about this. they acknowledge the issue but can't offer an (acceptable) solution; - a wireless keyboard defeats the purpose of having a portable laptop, - they could send a technician to replace the keypads on-site but very expansive option! they say it is not a technical issue but a design issue. and as such not covered under warranty. not sure if this argument <non-public info removed. tos73>you have 30 days from shipment to return an unsatisfactory system for any reason -- do so, and purchase a different model with a more suitable keyboard design. i thought it is 15 days. and also, i have set up the machine now and don't want to take it all off again! still don't understand why dell manufactures keyboards like this!?  if they were sold via a normal shopfront (not on line) i would never have bought it!for new systems in the us and many other places, it's 30 days.  refurbished systems may have a shorter return period. at least in the us, the xps 13 models are sold at retailers such as best buy, etc. i am wondering if there is some way to turn off the backlight on the keyboard during the day i.e. in bright light? the issue for me is that the letters on the keyboard automatically turn white in daylight and are unreadable?the f5 function key on your keyboard (at least on my xps 15) allows you to cycle between various levels of keyboard brightness, including completely off. on my xps this can be done on the f6 key. \n",

      "content: dell has probably the worst customer support of any of the big computer firms. hp, lenovo and even acer have better tech support. as an it guy with over 20 years experience i can tell you this poor support is nothing new. dell just does not care enough about its customers to give them anything but script reading outsourced \"techs\" who have zero real it skills. so here we go on my journey of mediocrity in the tech support world. so i have this expensive xps 17 that i purchased for a staff member. it came with windows 11 home. so because i needed to join it to the domain and my company has proprietary software that is not win 11 compatible i wiped the machine and installed windows 10 home. i upgraded the machine to window 10 professional. everything went smoothly. os activated immediately, drivers are all up to date, windows updates complete seamlessly and so do our company programs. user uses his machine for just over an hour and it freezes. has to be hard reset. hoping its a one off i have the end user reboot and he goes back to work. another 93 minutes pass and the machine freezes for a second time. at this point i put physical hands on the machine. it is warm but not hot. everything is plugged in correctly. i run an sfc scan and that comes back with errors and says it fixed them. i run it again and it comes back clean. reboot the machine. the user goes back to work. 37 minutes later machine freezes again. i run all of the pre-bios tests and they all come back clean. as does a mem test and a ssd test. event viewer has nothing but a few dcom errors. no bluescreens happen at all. the machine just freezes. so time to call dell for assistance. i use assistance as loosely as is possible. so my conversation with the tech started poorly, so i knew it was going to be bad. \"i am helping multiple customers so i apologize in advance for the long wait time\" was never going to start me on a story that ended with success. the tech then proceeded to tell me that it was windows 10 that was causing the problem. i asked him how it could be windows 10 when it was fully updated and windows 10 had activated. this is where the bs started as it always does when their script runs out and they want you off of the chat/phone. the tech tells me \"that xps is coded to windows 11 only and that is what is causing the problem\". it should be noted that at this point there has been no troubleshooting at all from the technician. this was just his immediate answer. i then asked that if it was for windows 11 only how come windows 10 had activated and how did it have signed windows 10 drivers? his response? \"would you like me to connect you with the software department so they can give you a quote to reinstall windows 11?\"i told him i could not use windows 11 as it was not compatible with our companies programs. his reply \"would you like me to connect you with the software department so they can give you a quote to reinstall windows 11?\"at this point i disconnected from the chat as i knew it was pointless. dell shows that it is willingly to charge bonkers prices for its hardware with absolutely zero customer support if things go wrong. they literally leave you to either figure it out for yourself or pay for them to fix a product you have a warranty for. what is mind boggling to me is that my company spends 10s of thousands of dollars with dell each year and yet this is how they think they keep customers. i know that me taking my business elsewhere won't hurt them. but maybe if enough of us do then they will hire some competent customer service folks. i highly doubt it though.  dell (as with all other oems) supports the os it ships with the system - no others.if you want a 17\" system with factory windows 10 support, there is the precision 7770 model.the system will run windows 10, but as you would be with hardware from anyone else, you're on your own as far as running it.   the problem with that answer is that all of the drivers are signed which means all of thr parts of this laptop are windows 1 compatible. also how do you explain it running just fine on the other three that i purchased? i don't know if you installed windows 10 following the dell recommended procedure for sequence of installation of eg chipset drivers and so forth.  windows is also iffy occasionally and does things during installation that are not repeatable.  this is why companies use disk images to install from.i would wipe and reinstall - no reason to have sfc errors on a brand new system.  look up the dell documents on the sequence of dell drivers to install, and go that way.  also start with windows 10 pro now that you have a license key for it if possible, removing another source of problems.they also sent a link that doesn't work; they know everything that they need to know from my account profile but they insist upon an uploaded photo with all info written on a piece of paper placed beside the serial tag - i guess i should get a daily newspaper to put there as well to verify the date?i followed their instructions to a tee. that is what is so frustrating. the did zero troubleshooting. just blamed the os to get me off the chat. yep, the tech did zero troubleshooting he just wanted me off the chat. i could get if it was not compatible, but that would mean it would not activate and it definitely would not have a full set of signed drivers. \"mean it would not activate and it definitely would not have a full set of signed drivers. \"why do you think that activation and signed drivers have anything to do with proper confifuration?signed drivers just mean that the drivers have been supplied by someone with a developer certificate from microsoft.  it doesn't mean that they have been tested in any or all configurations, or any specific hardware.buahaha, you mean the drivers that are functional? those drivers? the ones that were downloaded and installed using dells support assist? those drivers? why would dell be supplying drivers for their own equipment that are not compatible? did you just want to attack me because you think you know better or because you just chime in on all posts to feel superior? so please tell me what i should be doing different? if the drivers came from the dell website for windows 10 for that model of laptop then why should they not work? \n",

      "content: hello,i have been having an issue with my xps 15 9570 ever since updating my bios version to 1.27.0 and has recently gotten much worse. since updating the bios, my xps is unable to remember my service tag no matter what i have tried. on startup, i am often greeted with this warning screen: \"warning: the service tag has not been programmed. this system will not function properly without a service tag.\"i proceed to go to the bios options setup menu where the service tag field is blank.i enter the service tag exactly, and the laptop usually turns on normally after that. the issue is that i have to repeat this step every time i turn my laptop on. no matter what option i select after entering the service tag, whether \"apply\" or \"restore settings\" or even saving as custom user settings, the laptop is unable to remember the service tag on the next startup.this issue occurs consistently when i close the laptop lid while on battery power (not plugged in). it also has happened while plugged in, but not nearly as often. before updating to 1.27.0, i was able to close the laptop lid and turn the laptop on without any errors or warning messages. it first started happening once a week, then a few times a week, and now it happens nearly every time i turn on my laptop. i have been unable to find any solution to this issue, so i have just had to deal with this and accept that i now need to type in my service tag whenever i turn on my laptop. i have seen a few places something about modern standby... would this be an issue stemming from that since it happens when closing the lid on battery power?the past few days this problem has gotten much much worse. when i try to turn the laptop on and am greeted with this service tag warning message, i enter the tag and the system starts up. but instead of turning on normally, the screen turns black with the keyboard backlights on and the fan speeds up noticeably. it stays like this for anywhere from 15-60 seconds then turns off. i have to press the power button to start this process again and i have had to repeat this anywhere from 1 to 5 additional times.i have also seen a few varying screens recently such as a screen for manufacturing mode, a black screen with small red numbers, a warning that the date/time are not correctly set, etc. once i had the front light (under the trackpad) blink twice amber and once white. instead of the usual 10 or so seconds to start up, i have had to wait as long as 5-6 minutes to actually see the computer lock screen.i have searched various dell community forum discussions and other troubleshooting websites, but haven't found any solutions to this problem. i have tried countless \"solutions\" for similar problems other have had, but my laptop just forgets the service tag regardless of what i do.this is particularly frustrating as a student, since it is an unnecessarily long and complicated process to turn my laptop on while in class or for when i need to complete work, especially where this is a new issue. i am growing more impatient with this issue and am stumped on what i can do to resolve this.i would greatly appreciate an actual solution to this issue where i don't need to enter the service tag each time i want or need to use my computer.thanks in advance!solved!go to solution.since this service tag problem occurred after bios update, i suggest contacting dell technical support to get permission to downgrade to a previous bios update or help fix the problem.contact us | dell usain the meantime, please read the information thoroughly in link below. downgrading the system bios on a dell system | dell usplease read important information in your dell product support page:drivers & downloads | dell usview solution in original postsince this service tag problem occurred after bios update, i suggest contacting dell technical support to get permission to downgrade to a previous bios update or help fix the problem.contact us | dell usain the meantime, please read the information thoroughly in link below. downgrading the system bios on a dell system | dell usplease read important information in your dell product support page:drivers & downloads | dell usrgkmaany updates? you contacted dell tech support for assistance ? thanks for the reply and apologies for the delayed response from my end. i will downgrade the bios to 1.26.0 as soon as i can (should have time later today) and will let you know if that fixed the problem.i have successfully downgraded to bios 1.26.0 and with my brief testing the problem seems to have been fixed! i'll have to continue testing to see if it is fully fixed, but it looks promising. i appreciate the help! you have saved me from this frustration thanks!\n",

      "content: xps seem to have a well documented issue of leaking a sticky viscous fluid.   dell support is completely unhelpful mainly due to the fact it is completely designed to facilitate warranty repairs.   everyone seems to have the same question. is this toxic? well, dell is never going to tell us that. if it is toxic, they aren't going to publicly admit that; bad publicity.  .  they aren't going to say its 'non-toxic' because that is just a loaded term.  if they say that and some one eats it or something then they have to defend themselves , etc etc.  see no way they can confirm or deny this.  so lets do our own research.   most people jump to the 'liquid' connection with an lcd (liquid crystalline display).  that too is a very viscous fluid. that must be the culprit!   well, if you've seen a leaky xps you would soon realize there is no way the lcd liquid is that voluminous.  lcds are technically liquid and can leak, but there doesn't seem to be very much of that stuff actually in an lcd screen.  and most of the time the screens still work and there are no cracks so what gives?  has to be something else. ok, this is where my research has taken me.   the substance leaking from the xps that looks like glue is ....probably glue.  its the only thing on the screen that is abundant enough to show up in those quantities and its not critical to the screen working.   the substance i think we are seeing is usually called optic bonding compound and is used to hold the touch part of the screen to the actual lcd.   it is the adhesive that keep the two together and give the screen that tactile response.  so the question becomes is that stuff toxic? well i have no idea. i don't know what dell screens use, so i can't even research it further.  its a glue; and the most modern kinds of these materials are silicon based. both of those things seem reassuring.  unless dell will chime in with the mds for the bonding compound used in their laptops we will never know for sure. in the future, i would use gloves if i have to clean this mess up again. (didn't think about it until mid way through the cleaning) , clean surfaces with alcohol based pads , and discontinue use immediately.   obviously don't eat it, touch your face , etc.   wish i could be more helpful.  maybe someone more knowledgeable than i can chime in. hi, thank you for reaching out to us. we will look into this case on priority. we don't want out customers to go through something like this. kindly private message your system service tag or the express service code for us to get more details and assist you further. #iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".i have the same problem on my xps 27 aio 7760. on attached pic a distinctive outline on top and both sides of the screen can be seen. on the bottom of pc screen very sticky liquid is coming out. this is an expensive pc and is only 4-yearsold. over the years i only had purchased dell systems, but with this experience, if there is no solution, i will be looking elsewhere. to add to my yesterday’s post. i bought this best available and most expansive ($2.5k) all-in-one system in nov. 2017 thinking it would last long time. the warranty and extended warranty i paid for, until it was no longer available, expired in oct. 2021. in december i noticed a line in the top corner of the screen and at first thought it was a crack. but when the line started moving, i thought it was moisture penetration. i blamed my wife for using a wet tissue. over the period of almost six months this moisture line expended to the other corner and down on both sides of the screen. i searched online and found that this moisture may go away from the heat of the screen. i turned pc upside down trying to drain it. it didn’t help. thinking that it was our fault i did not contact dell.yesterday, i accidently touched the bottom of pc and found sticky substance that i couldn’t get off my hand. searched online and found this and other threads. others reported similar problem with dell lcd’s. i know now that the problem was in design and manufacturing. very expansive lesson. hope my experience will help others in making purchasing decisions.i’d like to add more history on this pc. when it first arrived in nov. 2017, right out of the box, i noticed a short line in the top corner of the screen that looked like a crack. i assumed that pc was damaged during shipment. contacted dell and they replaced the system. now putting two and two together, i am convinced that it was the leak problem: just started to develop. in 2019 i had to ship this pc to dell for service for different issue. this xps system obviously was all lemon and eventually dell discontinued selling it.as far as toxicity – any bonding compound, even water based, you buy in the store comes with extensive hazard warning. short of proper disposal and considering the screen size, families with or without children are set for a long exposure time.if it was an automobile, a recall would’ve been issued long ago.dell-cares comment?opened my own thread, but posted in the wrong section - laptops xps, instead of desktops xps. don't know how to move it.https://www.dell.com/community/xps/fallo-pantalla-dell-xps-27-quot-7760/m-p/8318502#m105507there appears to be no affordable solution to this problem. it was a bad design and we all got short changed on this short lived piece of<profanity removed. tos76>\n",

(written in french sorry) you could reboot and tap f12 when you see the dell splash screen. when the f12 menu opens select option to run diagnostics. there's probably a fan speed test that will report speeds, both \"normal\" and under load. ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeei spoke with hwinfo64 developer (here) and he says what dell is very protective on disclosing info about interacting with this area of the system, therefore unfortunately with recent dell models many of the readings won't be available (at least via hwinfo64) for monitoring (unless some miracle happens).therefore for now (support assist) diagnostic screen (via f12 as suggested by @rohe ) with health status (system info) is probably the only way (you can go into \"advanced test\" mode and pick fan tests only, then similar info will be available via logs too, it will try to run fans over a full range of rpms displaying current and target speeds) something like below: although my french in not good, i believe neither of those displays are a warning.  the first one is asking if you would like to upgrade to a newer version.  you can disable those offers by selecting the do not show updates.  the second one advises that a dell sensor(s) report may not respond as expected.  you can click that one to not display again, as well.i've used hwinfo64 for years with dell computers with no problems. as mentioned, ymmv.\n",

what are the other 2 and can they cause a problem?my nvidia control center shows this:so the question is what are those connections not connected?oh, yesterday i had a zoom lock up. 15 processes stopped working according to the event viewer. all of them reported the same basic error cause, unknown:============faulting application name: detect_thermalperformance_gaming.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0xa5a45937faulting module name: unknown, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x00000000exception code: 0xc0000005fault offset: 0x00007ff7e2370b9dfaulting process id: 0x0x725cfaulting application start time: 0x0x1d923c06acd49c8faulting application path: c:\\program files (x86)\\hewlett-packard\\hp support solutions\\modules\\sudf\\detect_thermalperformance_gaming.exefaulting module path: unknownreport id: 6f969f3c-21d6-4276-9941-abe5b9d725f7faulting package full name: faulting package-relative application id:====================this was not a normal lock up. i wasn't completely 'dead'.... but effectively i was. my mouse could be moved on the screen, but the mouse buttons didn't work.what that meant was that the video buffer was being updated and the os displayed the changes, made to the buffer by the video card of course... nothing worked though and i had to use the power button to restart.i'm not calling this the nvidia lock up problem though. could even be zoom that had an update before i connected. didn't say i had to reboot though, so maybe one was required? who knows???i have heard from a user already privately that they never used anything but external headphones with the green audio output, but does have the lock ups. if so, then your hypothesis is not correct.does have me thinking about those 2 nvidia audio drivers and if they are needed?still, it could be working for you. no one knows how to force a fail or have a handle on what has happened?let's see what happens though for a few weeks i guess?this is a change i can make, i do have external speakers i can use. since i know i can go over a month without a lock up, and i never know when the next one would happen, i'll wait and see how you make out.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.\n",

      "content: referencing this older thread = xps 8950, number of 3.5\" sata drives?the dell xps 8950 can physically support two 3.5\" sata hdds. however, unless you actually order two hdds from dell they will ship the xps 8950 with only only one blue plastic hdd caddy and one sata cable for the first hdd steel bracket, leaving the second hdd steel bracket with nothing.to install the second hdd you have to first go buy the missing blue plastic caddy and the missing left angle sata cable for the second bracket.  see xps 8950, add a 2nd sata hdd man, with the liquid-cooler and space for a decent video-card ... xps-8950 is looking pretty good inside these days. i think i'll go check and see what the max power-supply wattage is.750w platinum is the max power supply option. i am stuck in the process of installing a second hard drive , not because it is difficult to install but lack of hard drive caddy (the blue plastic piece , why does dell do that with the proprietary design?)  which dell does not include like in earlier years and difficulty in finding the correct oriented sata signal cable (not the power adapters, they are ther ewith the power supply)  . the \"l\" shape slot must be facing in one direction and the cable must face the oppositie direction. most sata signal cables have both cable and the l slot  going the same direction. wheh i finally found those cables on sale, the shipping rate  is expensive  and the length is not adequate for the second hard drive drive bay at upper left corner. this is frustrating , dellalways has something proprietary. i just hope the power supply does not fail when the warranty expired.hard drive caddy - look on ebay, a ton of listing under $10right angle sata - this $5 adapter will do the trick so you can use any sata cable you likehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00cjdtrl4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=utf8&psc=1any (not supported) way to add a 3rd 3.5in hdd in the middle \"gap\"?i'm finally saying goodbye to my xps8700 and i could easily add 3*3.5\" hdds there, which i'd like to move over to my new xps8950. i didn't even cross my mind that dell would make newer models less expandable.thanks!always ok if you can tailor-make it.  but as a general observation, space outside hdd is always much harder to get than space inside hdd. so the easiest thing might be just to buy large capacity hdd.now define large with the explosion of data. i dump the oldest/smallest of the 3 hdds and buy the largest affordable at the moment. the 3 that i want to move are 8tb, 10tb, and 12tb. just checked to see if i can combine 2 of those (but hey, they are still under warranty) with an 18tb one and was surprised to see that even 20tb are out. when did we see 14tb and 16tb, i must be living under a rock!now, do i want all of my vms and snapshots to be on a single hdd that i don't rclone to the other one every weekend... probably not.... can i get an enclosure and put one outside via usb - sure, if i'm not spinning the vms there but using it as a 321 backup target.i was just puzzled that dell has cheaped out so much that they won't have the 3rd cage in the middle, saved $10 on a blue plastic caddy even for the 2nd hdd, oh and another $2 for a sata data cable.i'm seriously thinking about shipping it back to them. we used to get a bit more expandability for much less than $3,449.99... yeah, i know 7% inflation is not 7% but still.there are 22tb sata drives for sale now.probably a bigger one will be announced by the time i finish this paragraph.what hurts more with bigger drives is that it's more obvious that they aren't the tb we knew and that 22 tb you pay for will store 20 tib realistically.\n",

      "content: hi all,i have an xps 8950 that is about 9 1/2 months old.  it is based on a 12th gen core-i9, the 12900k.  the system device is a stock 2 tb nvme m.2 ssd (dell original).  the only mod(s) that i made were to install 2 sata iii hard disks (10tb and 14tb).the computer came with win 10 home, updated it to win 10 pro and eventually to win 11 pro.  no problems.pc health check indicates that all of the hardware is win 11 compatible.i ran hardware diagnostics and there is no problem.the following is the error that i get when i attempt to update the o/s to version 22h2 (win 11)note that this error message says \"your pc has hardware that isn't ready for this version of windows\"i followed all the links and nowhere is there an explanation of why this isn't working.i have contacted dell tech support and didn't get anywhere (no big surprise .. )has anyone with an xps 8950/core-i9 12900k been able to successfully install version 22h2 of win 11?  does anyone have a work-around?tia ..sdfthere do seem to be a few things microsoft has put up blocks to stop the upgrades until the situation can be worked out.you may be able to override the situation by using the install media to do an upgrade directly from your desktop by selecting the setup file on the install media.  but you may still encounter the situation causing the original message.i have two systems which give no indication there is an upgrade available.  i am hoping that may change in the near future.  if not, i will be using the process to update mine.i should have mentioned the following:a) the following was seen in windows update on my system:so i could not update via the usual windows update methodb) i used windows11installationassistant.exe (downloaded directly from microsoft) to attempt the update .. i used windows11installationassistant to update my non dell, windows 11 compliant laptop and it worked. could also mean that microsoft is \"doling\" out this update so that (a) their servers don't get overloaded, (b) to limit the number affected systems if something serious should suddenly pop up as it's being rolled out.my xps 8930 from 2019 running win 10 21h2 has finally been offered win 11 via windows update in the past week. this is very first time i've gotten that offer since win 11 was originally released.  don't want win 11, so never attempted to download/update manually, even if i could easily get it that way.just microsoft being microsoft...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeei'm sure that m$ is \"doling\" out the updates, but the problems i saw was subsequent to using the windows11installationassisstant which bypasses the update servers.  the current 22h2 update doesn't like something on my hardware.  i don't know whether the problem is specific to my setup or is a problem with the 8950 12th gen core i9 computer set.hardware: xps 8950, core-i9 12900k, 32 gb, 2 tb nvme ssd (m.2), 10 tb sata hdd, 14tb sata hdd, nvidia 1660 ti graphics.@killerpooh - is bios set to raid or ahci? just don't change that setting...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeio sono riuscito con l’aiuto di microsoft ad installare la versione 22h2, ma non funzionano molte applicazioni ( anche support assist non parte!).i gave this link to someone in another forum.  i can't check myself but if you get a chance, you might see if the link gives you any additional info.  third party link, so of course, be careful.https://www.diskpart.com/windows-11/upgrade-to-windows-11-22h2-0001.html#:~:text=select%20%22ni22h2%... i have an 8950 with a 12700k, 32gb of ram and i added a 1tb firecuda 530 as the system drive, i am using the stock wd sn810 in the other nvme slot and replaced the hdd with a samsung sata ssd. i switched the bios to ahci from raid. (don't just switch the setting in the bios, there is a process that must be followed.) i have a rtx 3060ti video card and added a soundblaster-z series sound card. i also replaced the cooler but kept the stock fans. i successfully upgraded to win 11 22h2 using the win 11 install assistant. so it is weird that yours is saying there is a hardware issue. i would be surprised if it is due to you having the 12900k but it is possible. have you tried disconnecting the aftermarket hdds one at a time to see if you still get the error? also as rohe has alluded to, have you changed anything in the bios?hello all, the problem is solved .. i had a printer that used the universal print class driver and per recent information from microsoft, a safeguard hold was placed on any system that had either that kind of printer or had a printer that used a microsoft ipp class driver.on 28 sept 2022 (very late in the day), microsoft pushed an updated 22h2 win 11 image that doesn't have the aforementioned problems.the real problem here is that when a safeguard hold is placed on a system and you attempt to install or update win 11 via the windows11installationassistant, you don't get an error message until many minutes past the start of the installation, and the error message is vague at best.nonetheless, thanks for all assistance rendered.\n",

      "content: hello all,i'd like to upgrade my xps 8950 to a core i7-13700k as they become available at the end of the month. it's my understanding that since our xps's use a z690 chipset we should only need a bios update to be able to use these processors. does anyone know if bios 1.6 already supports them? or if we can expect a new bios soon to add support?thanks!this forum faq does not specify any support for the 13th gen as of yet. possibly there may be a bios update but generally dell does not support a cpu gen update and will release a new system with a 13th gen cpu. but possibly a moderator can add information to your question.that would be very disappointing as the socket isnt changing for this and our motherboards chipset is expressly supported per intel. my precision t3800 for instance came with a c2d e6600 but was able to be upgraded to a c2q 9650 which is a full generation ahead. but generally dell does not support a cpu gen update and will release a new system with a 13th gen cpu. but possibly a moderator can add information to your question.agreed.or put another way ...on each specific dell model (model-number or release), due to the cpu microcode needing to be included and validation testing ... usually ... a machine only officially works with the processors that it originally sold/shipped with. there are some rare exceptions, but usually those are just other processors from that same time frame, that are in the same \"generation\" or family. my precision t3800 for instance came with a c2d e6600 but was able to be upgraded to a c2q 9650 which is a full generation ahead.i don't deny it happened, but that sounds like a fairly -isolated case for a oem motherboard in a pre-built..based on what you posted, i would have expected that machine to be able to use core2-duo and core2-quads like e6600, e6700, q6600, and q6700. there were some others after that (that would fit) and some even worked. however, there was something special about those new ones (bus-speed, ram-speed or something like that) and only certain motherboard provided that additional support.but yeah, different times now. just to give you isome data @pcxt21 then i tried last night to install 13900k into my existing xps 8950 with 12700k but the system didn't boot. at the time i switched cpu''s i had firmware v1.7.0 installed.afterwards i noticed version v1.8.0 was out in november and installed it. but have not done another test run on the 13900k cpu but i am sure i will over the next couple of days tried to get details on that firmware v1.8.0 from dell support but that was just like speaking to a robot , minus the ai.i just re-checked the internal xps 8950 parts list. there are no 13th gen cpu.\"our motherboards chipset is expressly supported per intel\"the intel specs do not apply to oem hardware, bios, etc.if still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session.find your service tagi tried with a 13700k cpu with the v1.8.0 bios, no support for the 13th gen cpu for the 8950 yet.thx @dstewart51 , i will try on next bios as soon as it comes out bios 1.9.0 came out today. do you have any update on its support for 13th gen?\n",

      "content: i've been having the same freezing issue that so many other have had with this frustrating xps 8940. since i can't reply to the other thread, i'm starting this one to add my two cents.problem: video freezes when idle (mostly) and rarely when using the computer.this computer is on 24/7 and freezes randomly, but reliably, several times a week. computer has to be shut down to resolve issue.specs:xps 8940, intel i7-118700k, 32gb, 1tb nvme, nvidia rtx 3070 things i've tried:- installing a fresh windows 10 on a completely different drive (ssd) - didn't help.- downgrading bios to 2.3 (this seems to have helped but not 100%)- changed video card (tried a gtx1070, gtx 970). didn't help.- disabled turbo boost in bios. didn't help.- removed graphics card and run with on-board video. does not freeze without a graphics card. obviously, this is not a solution for a high-end pc.this problem has been happening since new and this product is now out of warranty so, of course, dell won't support it. i tried going through support a couple times while it was in warranty but didn't have the time to spend hours and hours, days, weeks going through support with dell as this system belongs to a client. i finally happened upon the forum thread below and see that this is quite a common issue. my experience with dell in the past as been good, but the support now is terrible. making users spend endless hours going thru troubleshooting steps is completely unacceptable. definitely not buying or recommending dell to my clients anymore. i've almost lost a client for the amount of time i've wasted on this system. ultimately, i built the client a new computer and have taken the dell computer home for troubleshooting when i have time.if you've read the other threads then you know there is no definitive solution for this problem.  my xps8940, purchased in 2021, does not fortunately have this freezing problem, using an nvidia rtx 2060 super and i7-11700, latest bios v2.10.0, mobo is 0k3cm7, running win10home.   if it were me i would have asked dell to replace until this was no longer a problem or for a refund.  yes, but not everyone has the time and patience to jump through the hoops to get meaningful support. dell used to have much more effective support. looks like they sent out a bunch of lemons and are obviously not taking responsibility for them.end-users often spend hours troubleshooting first, only to then have to jump through all sorts of hoops with dell in the hopes that dell might be supportive. dell ran their diagnostics twice on this system and were very dismissive when it came up with no errors or problems found. i didn't have the time or patience to push further as this system wasn't in my possession (client). you can expect how frustrating it is when there is an obvious problem and the manufacturer simply says \"our diagnostics don't show any problems\".just wanted to add my experience and case to the stack since i couldn't reply in the other thread.i don't disagree that sellers will often deny and dismiss consumer complaints. i would say my dealings with dell support for my xps 8940 have been mostly favorable, and i have used dell latitude laptops extensively in my work and found them very reliable, so it is disconcerting to read about these xps 8940 issues (especially this common thread regarding the system freezing)  and the lack of dell's response to make it right, no matter what. these are expensive boxes, and the consumer deserves dell's robust attention to customer satisfaction.  @julesme, you are part of the 'lock up' club. @ishmael is not, for some unknown reason his 8940 does not have the same problem as many others.there are 2 root causes it seems. bios v2.4.0 and later versions, and any nvidia discrete card installed.going back to bios v2.3.0 was at one time a 'cure' (that is you didn't lock up, but overtime, lose many updates and most were security ones). however, parts of the bios code could not be updates (intel management engine (which i assume was the prime reason for it not always curing the problem).i don't think this is a dell problem per se. not a bunch of lemon's at least. if you don't have an nvidia card you would not have the problem. no user with the other discrete cards offered (amd's cards) that have similar capabilities have reported the problem.what all of us have hit is the support agent's responses, and the first is probably from a script when someone reports, what looks like to them at least, a s/w problem. isolate the cause... safe mode, re-install the os, etc. it of course will not fix this specific problem.other problem, dell can't recreate it it appears. not all nvidia users, like @ishmael have the problem either? speculation was on the motherboard, but that doesn't seem to be the case.a linux user (at least i know of one) has the same problem, therefore it can't be windows itself related.so it would appear to be either h/w or timing that is the issue.again, this begs the question of what was changed in bios v2.4.0 code? bios code is written usually by the board vendor, and dell i understand used 2 for the 8940. initial 8940's shipped with the 10th gen intel by the way, maybe those with the 10th gen are not seeing the problem? i believe only those with 11th gen have reported the problem, but i have no way of know if true or how many 8940 with nvidia cards have been sold and how many of those have a problem.quick solution, get an amd card. dell will not swap out the nvidia for an amd though. i've been told by more than one dell employee this can't be done.buying an amd card will solve the problem, small cost i guess vs. a new pc. that said, on bios v2.10.0 i've had some long periods of no lock ups, not hours or days, weeks and even over a month. more indication to me this could be a timing issue and changes in s/w can change timings on some operations.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.very much appreciate the replies and support here. sad that dell cannot even come close to even this level of support. as i mentioned, the computer is now being used as my personal computer and i can deal with the issue myself and not have my client suffer the defective unit any longer. as likely with many of you, i've invested many hours of my personal time troubleshooting this and it has left a real blight on my relationship and impression of dell. there was a time when i used to recommend dell as they seemed to have made alot of progress in fixing their reputation for poor support - it seems they've returned to a low level of support.@julesme.i don't know if they have degraded support or not? i've had xps's and even dimensions over the last 20+ years. at one time xps support was in the us even and a special access to it. however, having recently xps 8500, 8700, and an 8940, only had 2 warranty instances on them. the nvidia lock up on the 8940 and on the 8700 the dvd player got destroyed. it worked fine reading dvd/cd's but the first dvd i tried to burn it destroyed itself??? replaced immediately without a hassle.the 8940, common debug for us all, but no fails that produce data... fixing something with out knowing where to look is hard, especially if you can't recreate it?i was put through the normal replace/re-install cycle, but after that was done, they did swap out my video card and motherboard, with it still happening, so another swap to and older motherboard... and that included the 3rd party doing the work. it cost dell resources to do it, including the mailing of the parts to the 3rd party. after that, the exchange offer. if i had been within the 30 days of purchase i could have returned the xps for a new one i was told as well.so i can't say they support is any worse or better than before? i do fault them as not being open here and posting about the problem and what they are doing to resolve the long running problem.by the way, it seems from the forum the 8930's have a serious bios problem with the latest version. i'd say this is a development problem, and possibly with a sub-vendor. i can't blame that on support either. maybe dell's qa and/or beta testing/system test, but not support.also, lenova has a similar problem with nvidia cards. https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/gaming-desktops/lenovo-legion-t5-28imb05-constantly-gets-severe-freezes... and eventually they had a 'fix' but that didn't solve the problem on 8940's. 25 pages of it from mar. 2021 on that link, and still active... as it keeps happening to people.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.i have been having the same issue with my 8490.  i have been working with dell for months and there has not been a resolution.  my 8490 is still under warranty, but now looking at these other posts it seems maybe they are just trying to keep making fixes that don't fix anything until the warranty expires.  i am very frustrated and have been a dell customer for many years.hi irv,so, has that been confirmed by various users then that by replacing the nvidia card with an amd one that that stops these freeze issues?   (how about if you replace the card with another manufacturer besides amd?)  if this is the common solution i don't understand why dell would not be willing to swap the card. seems like there was one person on here who reported having bought two xps 8940s, configured identically i think, but only one had the freeze problem.  @ishmael,no, not confirmed by dell at least.one can draw that conclusion very easily though, by this data:i do not know of anyone though that had pulled the dell supplied nvidia card and used another vendor's card. i suspect (at least for me) the cost could be high for a similar card, and one would expect dell to correct the problem.i was told by dell support they can only swap the same card you have. so that i think tied support's hands. it would take someone higher up to make that call.now think of what it means to dell to do that? forgetting not doing it and the cost of user resentment and possibly/probably lost business for the minute, what is the exposure in number of cards needing to be replaced.yes, there was one person who reported 2 'identical' 8940's purchased... and one had the problem and the other did not. he did share the configurations and they seemed to match. he did do one thing, both came with 2x8gb dimms. he took the 2 out of one and put it into the other one, and bought 2x16gb dimms for that one that it was removed from. supposedly the one with the 4x8gb dimms is the one that did not lock up as i recall? can't find that thread exactly now... but that was the basic info provided. that user has since not replied to requests for info, from at least 2 people.one other problem of doing a total recall, not everyone with an nvidia card claims to have the problem? i would think dell knows who ordered the 8940's with nvidia cards so they have an idea of the cost. also, what can they do with used video cards? don't forget, these cards are in 8930's and 8950's. no problems it seems exist in those xps's? if i were dell i would 'assume' that the problem is not the video card itself. however, there is no word from dell what they are doing or even if they are doing anything?i sort of understand their position, but i surely don't like it. i guess to some extent cost overrides customer satisfaction. i also think i'd be more 'satisfied' if i knew what dell knows and what actions they are taking? i sort of feel they are not doing much and hope that future code changes by someone (bios maker, nvidia, or some application) will fix the problem.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.\n",

like windows is getting slowed-down so much, it can tell it can't operate properly and it's trying to let you know.3. no, keep your nvidia geforce rtx 3060 ti in it's proper slot. clean-install the latest whql driver from nvidia.com. there is no slow-down or latency problems with nvidia 3000-series cards or drivers. if you don't game (and are that worried about it) you can alternatively install the latest studio-driver.i have recently helped some dell customers here on the forum with various latency issues. it always comes down to one thing ... either dell has pre-loaded some flakey software (or heavy drivers suites) or the owner has installed some software and/or drivers (after they got computer) that is using-up too many cpu cycles.would you be open to thoroughly erasing the c-drive and clean-installing windows? not dell's, but microsoft's from here:https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11you install to a blank c-drive ssd, to it's \"un-partitioned space\". if you want to try it, i can provide you with some more detailed directions.i have spent the past day doing all you wrote about. unfortunately, nothing worked. i installed the latest firmware and then made 2 changes. i disabled both intel speedstep and intel speed shift.i did not think i was able to do this from many people. i have been using throttlestop 9.5 for the past week and thought it was preventing the cpus from reducing power. after 14 minutes, latencymon has not reported an issue. this is a first for me.please let me know if i am doing something dangerous to my computer. i did buy

      "content: i have an xps 8930 with a 2tb nvme ssd that i have been trying to upgrade to a 4tb nvme. i have been attempting this for almost 1 month now. sorting through a mountain of forums, communities, several versions of cloning software and tech support but still have yet to solve this problem. along the way there have been many suggestions to perform a clean install of windows.so i just tried to do a fresh install of windows 11 by inserting the brand new nvme ssd that has been initialized and using a windows 11 bootable media usb,  and guess what, the problem still exists. here is the problem. i keep getting a bsod stop code: kernel_security_check_failure upon start up. i have not found anything that lets me get by this. i'm by no means a tech geek but not incompetent either. i'm sure i may be missing something simple that needs to be changed in the bios? this is driving me insane. my warranty has expired, and dell wants to charge me for the solution. is there a procedure anywhere that defines step by step how to correctly perform upgrading to a larger nvme drive?changes that need to be made in the bios to prevent the kernel security check failure?thanks in advance for your help.taz@taz1962 i don't know if this will solve your problem but some ssds work better if sata operation in the bios is set to ahci vs raid. dell usually defaults to raid. so try your fresh install again with the ahci setting. @vic384 is spot on with that advice.can i assume that with the smaller drive installed the system works properly? if the only change you made is to a larger ssd and the problems started then, it is possible that the new drive is defective. have you tried the larger drive in another system?also try this approach. download disk genius available here. create a bootable usb flashdrive, the option is in the menu of dg, and erase the sectors on the larger drive. that will wipe the drive clean prior to a clean install and if there are any problems with the drive it will show up during the wipe process. be patient as a wipe can be a bit time consuming though usually not bad with an nvme ssd.kernel security check failure / kernel_security_check_failure indicates what error is happening with windows subsystem, but for clean install you're supposed to boot from usb media first (not your internal storage) e.g. using f12 key on computer startup and follow installation steps (with clearing partitions on destination/new 4tb drive, which obviously will wipe all data there if any).if you're absolutely sure what this error is happening on a boot media - then it it possible something is wrong with usb file structure, perhaps it's worth rebuilding it using windows media creation tool via this microsoft link (\"create windows 11 installation media\" section):https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11it's safer if you do it with other drives (containing data you would like to preserve) disconnected to avoid accidental deletion of a wrong partitions on a different drive(-s).after windows install is completed (assuming everything went well) - take out your usb media and make sure system boots correctly. install drivers. then in bios double-check if right drive (uefi) is selected as primary boot source, turn pc off, reconnect archive drives, turn pc back on.now theoretically windows should boot from correct drive (your nvme) and archive drives recognized/available for access.you probably can also clear tpm and disable \"secure boot\" feature in bios but after everything is done - reenable it. i have an xps 8930 with a 2 tb nvme ssd that i have been trying to upgrade to a 4 tb nvme. i have been attempting this for almost 1 month now. sorting through a mountain of forums, communities, several versions of cloning software and tech support but still have yet to solve this problem. there's not a lot mentioned on your process that you were trying . did you clone the 2tb nvme to a sata ssd and then try to clone back from the ssd to the newly installed 4tb nvme?  or did you image the 2tb nvme to an external ssd and then prepare a flash drive with macrium reflect recovery media ?if the latter, you'd just swap the old nvme with the new nvme drive then boot the system from macrium reflect recovery flash drive (f12 at powerup) and you should've been able to restore the image to the new drive.if you add your new 4tb m.2 nvme ssd to a pcie slot with an adapter you will have 6tb of storage and will not need to concern yourself with cloning. ahci is still a good recommendation.\n",

thx once you used win 10 (from upgrade), your system id is recorded and kept by microsoft.  just do a clean install of win 10 now on the samsung ssd, select i don't have key during installation and your win 10 will be activated automatically when it connects online.  you must select the same version you had before.  do you remember you have home or pro?  so that i don't sound greek to you, are you comfortable with working inside computer (motherboard) and editing bios?ok awesome this worked although i did it with w8.1 but i’ll just follow the same steps i have in the past to get w10 how should i install machine chipset driver an intel heci driver should i install them alone from windows update or download them manually if manual example thx i all i can find in device manager system devices is intel(r) 82802 firmware hub device an intel(r) management engine interface don’t see any that say chipset itself but the ssd is now the primary boot an the hdd is empty unallocated exactly what i was looking for just want to follow your other steps but now sure exactly how thanks again it's good to practice and got result on win 8.  i will go over all basic steps and let you pick up from there.*  click here to download win 10 creation tool to a good working computer, double click to run and following instruction to create a usb to use on other machine*  go here to see drivers for your xps 8700 system, you may need to click on find drivers to expand and locating chipset driver, intel amt heci driver.*  prepping your machine, replacing coin cell battery with a new cr2032.  check and remove msata cache from motherboard if your system has one. *  with win 10 usb plug in, power on the machine, keep tapping f12 until you get one time boot.  select bios settings and verify uefi =  enable, sata mode =  ahci.  save and exit but keep tapping f12 again to select booting from usb drive under uefi option.*  following instruction to install windows, select i don't have key and select appropriate version of win 10 home or pro.  delete all partition until you are left with unallocated space, select next and let windows creating all necessary partitions as well as formatting, you don't need to do any of that.*  after windows installation is complete, you can customize the settings and installing the drivers downloaded from previous steps, then run windows update to let it installing the rest.  some are under optional updates.  go to disk management, right click on unallocated drive and select to create partition, following the wizard (keep clicking on next) and set your hard drive as drive d (with no name or data).enjoy your machine.thank you so much for everything everything is done ssd is primary boot drive an hdd is data everything’s updated an windows 8.1 updated to 10 appreciate the help very much drives are also updated to most recent versions your steps were perfect an easy to follow an solved my issue exactly to what i was looking for. i am glad that your upgrade went well.  here is the bonus add-on if you didn't have it already.crystal disk info -  which will monitor your drives, including the ssd.  it will tell you the health condition, allowing you to take appropriate action before a drive going bad.speccy -  a free system utility that give you a snapshot of you system components, including temperatures and speeds.adblock (for chrome) -  a lightweight extension which will prevent most pop-ups, including youtube ads. it will give you a better experience while surfing the internet.\n",

      "content: ok, so i'm sure this has been posted a million times, but here goes:bought a new corsair rm850x to replace the psu on my dell xps 8930. installed it all correctly, plugged all the cables in the correct way. turn it on, get immediate loud pop and spark. so i unplugged it, took it out, installed the old psu back in the computer.i turn it on, and it works, but there is no signal going to the tv (i have a samsung tv, not a real monitor, but i've been using the tv as one for years with no problem). turn it off and on again a bunch of times, still no signal. then i turned it on and left it running for awhile, and maybe five minutes later, magically the desktop showed up on the screen.also, when i am running the computer now, the cpu fan intermittently makes noise like it's hitting something as it spins. if i lay the computer on its side, it makes less of that noise. if i pick it up and stand it upright, it makes a lot of noise. i did not have this problem prior to this incident. i'm fairly certain it's not a loose cable hitting the fan. i did blow everything out with a can of air prior to doing this work, i suppose it's possible i got something stuck in there. i shut the computer down and now i am using my laptop. i am now kind of afraid to use my desktop. what did i fry? what should i be checking? what could be causing the fan to make noise? should i start with replacing the cpu fan? which one should i get? also, i still would like to upgrade the psu (the 460w the computer came with isn't cutting it for me anymore with video/photo editing and gaming, i also added more ram and a new gpu recently), what would you recommend? i am afraid to get another corsair even though i read good reviews otherwise.i only know enough about computers to get me into trouble, so please don't use too much technical jargon. i'd appreciate if you could write your answers like i was 5.  thank you in advance!it is possible you plugged wrong cable into the new corsair psu.  to avoid jargon, this new psu requires user to plug multiple power cables into the psu-side ports.  the original dell 460w psu is not like that.  all the power cables were factory connected inside the dell psu. you should probably look for a psu upgrade that is similar to the dell.  this would prevent you from making mistake plugging wrong cable into psu which can fry the psu, mobo or both.  corsair cx750 is one example of psu that has all cables connected. or evga 700br regarding cpu fan, it is easier to buy the entire dell fan and heatsink assembly (1d40r) than just the fan. you can swap just the fan.ok, thank you for the input. i will check out those psu's and also get a new fan/heatsink. thanks! @huey1n   = sure it's the cpu fan and not an add-in video card fan (assuming you have add-in video card) that's making noise? btw: if it still take a while for video to appear on tv when you boot, and you have an add-in video card, you might remove that card and plug tv directly into the onboard intel graphics hdmi port and see if the video appears faster.  removing card will also tell you if its fan is making noise.note: you should physically remove any add-in video card before connecting a monitor to the onboard intel port.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeei am not so sure if i've seen this type of issue been posted a million times.  but i suggest that you need to check thoroughly and determine the source of the noise before replacing any fan or part. first, with the computer power off and everything unplug, turn it every which way and direction to shake loose anything that may have left behind or detach after your earlier work.  second, setup and run your machine with the side panel open so you can see the inside while it is running.  this will help with finding where the noise coming from.last but not least, if you already are working to upgrade your rig, set your upgrade path to achieve better performance and avoiding thermal issue.  there are 2 types of cpu coolers, pancake and premium.  both are relying on a small 92mm top case fan to remove heated air from cpu area.  consider to upgrade cooling by adding more fans.  there are 2 front case fans can be added, upper fan can pull in cool air to cpu area, lower fan will create a front to back flow through and providing cool air to gpu.  consider to move hard drive to bottom cages if you are going to add fans.although not mentioning, you did not complain about difficulty with connecting 4-pin cpu cable, i guess that you have a pancake cooler.  a premium cooler will require to be removed to get access to cpu power header and cpu fan, case fan header.  regardless which one you have, upgrade your top fan to a 120mm fan ($15) and you can thanks me later.it should not be difficult to connect a fully modular psu to your xps 8930. most cables are well labeled. post a few good photos of the inside of your rig so we can see what you have going on.\n",

      "content: there may be a pattern here, but i'll add my bit of additional narrative to the sad tale.i got an xps 8950 less than a month ago. i ordered it with an m.2 system drive and a 3.5\" sata drive installed in one of the two drive cages inside the case. it arrived earlier than expected. great!on december 19, i ordered the $12 caddy needed to install an additional 3.5\" drive, or two 2.5\" drives, in the empty second drive cage. the site said it would be shipped on december 20. of course it wasn't. and now, at least according to their \"support\" people, it never will be:\"kindly be informed that the item is unavailable due to end of life.\"they gave me a number to contact if i want to order an \"alternate product.\" what \"alternate product\"? is there a different plastic caddy that also fits in the empty cage? there's nothing listed on their website. the caddy i ordered remains listed for sale, but now with an absurd delivery date that's over two months away.they obviously have the caddies. they must be putting them in most of the new computers they're selling: at least all those that are configured with a sata hard drive, which is a bunch of their starting configurations. indeed, that is how the very first configuration offered is set up ... and they promise they can deliver (for free) five days from now!the last two paragraphs of their email message to me, edited for accuracy to add the bracketed language:\"at dell, we take [completely unfounded] pride in our service so please let us know if you have any other questions [to which you would like an inaccurate answer].\" \"thank you for choosing dell. we appreciate your business [so long as you're buying an entire computer, but once you've paid for that, please don't bother us].\"solved!go to solution.just a followup, on the off chance anyone is interested....the suggestion of an alternate source is a good one. no one seems to have any xps 8950 caddies, unfortunately.after being told by email that my existing online order was being cancelled because the part is \"end of life,\" the actual order was updated to move the expected delivery date to february 28 (original ship date: december 20). so, yes, dell acknowledges the part exists, but they're more interested in installing them in new systems than selling them to customers whose money they already have.in a second email (responding to my earlier message saying i don't believe the part is end of life), the customer service guy told me to call sales ... who told me the same thing the online order system already did. when i pointed out that they must have them in stock to put in new machines, he passed me on to technical support. of course, when they asked whether i wanted the caddy to replace broken one or to add an additional drive, i opted for the ethically-supportable but practical mistake of telling the truth (the latter).in the meantime, i ordered a caddy that fits the 8940 and prior series on ebay. it looks like the same thing in photos, but apparently requires some surgery before it'll fit into an 8950, which has a different drive-cage design. if i can make it work, i can cancel the order; if i can't, i'll be out $12 and i guess i'll strap the drives into the cage with cable ties while waiting for the good one.view solution in original postthere are still supply chain delays from china, especially now with the rapid rise in covid cases there.lots of places are selling 3.5\" hdd caddies for xps 8950. some even say it's new and \"dell oem\".check this page and some of the others listed at bottom of that page for best price/shipping cost/delivery date,  etc. and i'm sure you can also find them on that other big shopping site too. ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeewhat bugs me is that they obviously have them, because they're installing them in new computers. okay, i get it: getting $1,800 for an assembled computer is much more interesting than getting $11.99 for a piece of plastic all by itself (though i bet the percentage margin on the $11.99 is much greater). but i don't like it.there are a lot of places selling caddies the seller says will fit in the xps 8950 (and '40 and '30 and '10). the dell part number for the 8950 caddy (34dyh), however, is different from the caddy for the earlier models (65khd). per a post in another thread, you can get the 65khd into the 8950 with the use of a hacksaw.thread (see the last post on page 1): solved: xps 8950, add a 2nd sata hdd - dell communityin photos, the two caddies look pretty close to identical. i suppose it's also possible that the non-oem ones are actually more versatile due to omitting bits of the oem design.not much choice other than going with a fake (hacksawed as appropriate), or just attaching the drives to the cage with plastic ties.it's been many years since i purchased a part directly from dell. i used to get dell parts from a place called parts-people. maybe a few (\"working pulls\" and they call them) from a reputable-seller on ebay (works out of austin, tx). now-days, i just get them from amazon.just a followup, on the off chance anyone is interested....the suggestion of an alternate source is a good one. no one seems to have any xps 8950 caddies, unfortunately.after being told by email that my existing online order was being cancelled because the part is \"end of life,\" the actual order was updated to move the expected delivery date to february 28 (original ship date: december 20). so, yes, dell acknowledges the part exists, but they're more interested in installing them in new systems than selling them to customers whose money they already have.in a second email (responding to my earlier message saying i don't believe the part is end of life), the customer service guy told me to call sales ... who told me the same thing the online order system already did. when i pointed out that they must have them in stock to put in new machines, he passed me on to technical support. of course, when they asked whether i wanted the caddy to replace broken one or to add an additional drive, i opted for the ethically-supportable but practical mistake of telling the truth (the latter).in the meantime, i ordered a caddy that fits the 8940 and prior series on ebay. it looks like the same thing in photos, but apparently requires some surgery before it'll fit into an 8950, which has a different drive-cage design. if i can make it work, i can cancel the order; if i can't, i'll be out $12 and i guess i'll strap the drives into the cage with cable ties while waiting for the good one.i had exactly the same problem last march after purchasing my new xps8950, in the uk dell customer care gave me the number of a third party company, based in london who tried to charge me £110 for a caddy plus £25 delivery (it was also a premium rate call which cost me over £7), i eventually got one of amazon.com for around $12 which didn't quite fit but after cutting it slightly slid in but didn't click into place, i also needed a connector too which again dell couldn't supply, unfortunately after installing the hard drive i found that the fans were speeding up and then slowing down so i removed the hard drive and just used an external one instead. i'm at the moment trying to extend the warranty which again wont work online and dell customer care cant help with either.dell customer care is nothing like it used to be and i'm beginning to think that once you by a dell these days then your on your own.\n",

      "content: i have recently purchased a dell xps 8950 and the computer is just fine.  it was delivered on time and set up was easy.but after sales service from dell is awful! i wanted to add a second hdd drive to the second (top right) bay, which does not have the blue bracket (why not you might ask)i contacted dell for a price on a 2tb hdd and the bracket and cables.  i spoke to someone by telephone who said it would take up to 48 to get a reply!!!  when it did come they quoted £140 for the hdd.  with regard to the bracket and cable this was their reply (i did not ask for them to fit it) we do not have new parts available for bracket and cables. however, i have mentioned the price for bracket with cables and engineer charges below. (price mentioned below is excluding the hdd cost)bracket and cables with an onsite engineer to replace the parts: 168.67 £bracket and cables without an onsite engineer: 57.90 £i found a suitable bracket and cables on ebay for about £15, and a hdd for £52.  poor service dell.at least i met a sensible dell customer rep who is very frustrated to tell me the real price of the blue bracket so he hinted to me that any dell workstation bracket in the aftermarket is compatible.  but while i asked the maximum drive size for hdd he insisted 2t and cautioned me about compatibility issue with anything larger than 2t.while paying for oem part and labor to dell, hp or any other brand, you are not just paying for the part but for an assurance that  if anything goes wrong during repair dell is solely responsible for that and followup services or parts will be free this is why prices are higher plus those parts get automatically covered in your computer's warranty (max 4 years). if your new drive fails you are on your own.  about the drive capacity : he/she is reading from a manual as he is supposed to do that, if the information provided by him doesn't match dell's online support documentation . you or me may sue dell  2tb is the max size tested by dell engineers,  i can confirm a 4tb will work. i would recommend opting for a 2.5 inch ssd instead.  thank you for reply and explaining. exactly we understand the reason of this cautious legal binding of dell.  i definitely won't count on dell for the defect of my own device added. we are honorable poeple. one thing dell engineers could really do is to have an open mind to test / certify a bigger hdd at 4-16 tb. these drives are on the market for quite some time already. how hard is that technically and legally?  power shortage?  noise level?  these are the only potential issues i guess dell does not want to get itself into -- due to the cheap blue plastic bracket design.2.5 inch ssd is a good option only after the nvme as they are about the same price range now with about 10 times speed difference.  i found one special dell 3.5 inch blue plastic bracket which can hold two 2.5 inch drive (no matter hdd or ssd) so it will be nice to have an extra \"slot\" -- motherboard does have 3 extra sata ports avavilable. and if we remove the dvd we can have 4 sata ports.i don't think dell would test any disk size it didn't sell... and right now the largest they sell installed or via parts is a 2tb drive.why should they test every size drive? drive size is usually a function of the os's file system anyway. why would you not expect any drive sold not to work?however, if you got a 20tb drive and had an access problem, i could see dell not supporting it or working on the problem.this same principle would be for any peripheral that dell didn't sell. for instance, it seems dell installs certain video cards only, and in my case, it is msi that makes it. nvidia cards are made by a few vendor's, all the same model. i suspect only the msi one would be supported by dell, and if i bought an asus for instance that they knew i didn't get it from them, they might not support it and any problem i had with it?if in doubt, buy the item and test it out. make sure you can return it though without a stocking fee.yes, i too have an external wd 4tb drive on my pc's, and one, an old xps8500 even with no problem at all.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.fair point. i don't contest here.the problem with dell is that they don't know when to say \" i don't know,i didn't test, and you are on your own risk.\" on that regard, i can pretty much rely on my insight to make my own call. when they say \" you may run compatibility issue with larger disk than 2t\" in black and white print (don't exactly remember the exact wording though), it gives readers a pretty strong influencing message that they did find something wrong. and they are in this business. this could ruin dell's reputation, if not already.i am shocked that the new 8950 only confirms up to 2tbs.  my existing xps 8910 confirms up to 4tb.  so why would they confirm a pc from 6+ years ago to have better storage than a new one?  i am shocked that the new 8950 only confirms up to 2tbs.  no, that is incorrect.under windows-10 or 11 ... initialized as gpt and formatted as ntfs ... you should be able to use 12-tb 3.5-inch spinning-platter hdd.and as far as the plastic tray ... i would be surprised if it's different than the 3.5-inch ones dell has always used over the years (in xps and alienwares).personally, i would get one of those $5 metal 3.5inch bracket/holders (that holds two 2.5inch sata ssds) insert that into the plastic-dell-tray and go that route ... only ssds (m.2-nvme or 2.5in-sata) inside the computer.@tahoejohnny  - where do see that dell validated a 4t drive in the xps 8910? their official xps 8910 specs don't even mention an upper limit on drive capacity.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeefirst off, i do appreciate your trying to help!  i could have sworn i researched this just a couple days ago, and definitely before i bought the 4tb for my 8910 that it would work.  but i cannot find it.  so i assume your correct and i am apparently wrong. (not the first or last)so, do you think two 4 tbs (one for photos, one for documents) would work?  dell stated i get 30 days, so maybe i should try it???lastly, if i am happy with my 8910 performance w10, maybe i should not spend the extra cash to upgrade?  i use it for photo and video editing.  no games.thanks again!\n",

      "content: good day everyone,back around october 13th my pc \"froze\" and i was ready to do a clean install of windows. at that time there was a new bios update (ver 2.10) for my xps 8940. i upgraded the bios and also the nvidia graphic drivers. i did not have a lock up from that time until november 5th. i guess my plan is to wait and see if the freezing will occur again before i do the clean install of windows.press and hold down on the power button until your computer turns off, then press the power button again to boot back up from scratch. if you were working on something important when the freeze happened, you may be able to recover it, depending on the program and how it handles unsaved documents. this may help you,rachel gomezwelcome to the 'club'.my experience is similar. on v2.9.0 for about 20 days and no lock up. then installed v2.10.0 and had a 'semi-lock up'. it was when i installed an nvidia game ready driver. it did complete the install but i could not close the windows. rest of the system appeared to be running. can switch to other windows. however could not get rid of the driver install window. could not do a shutdown or reboot either?  so i used the power button.that was on 10/15 and i was on v2.10.0. had been lock up free for 20 or so days at that time. since 10/15 i've not had a lock up nor a problem installing the latest nvidia grd driver?something is going on? i suspect a timing issue myself.i am not alone like this. a linux user was just about the 60 day mark with no lock up and had one yesterday., same bios installed in that period. v2.9.0 and v2.10.0.i don't feel like doing a clean install (on v11 22h2 which was installed during that period of time), too much to restore. over a years worth of programs and settings added to figure out what to copy over or re-install.will the 'freeze'' happen again? i suspect it will. i've seen no notice that it has been fixed, much less it is known to be caused by anything? just a matter of time but with each release of the bios it seems it takes longer to happen again.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.i don't know if i had the same issue as mine would never hard freeze forever.  it'd lock up for 30 seconds or so, then the pc would restart.  but in my case, windows event viewer would catch it, and it was always the video driver being blamed.problems started when i decided to do a wave of updates to everything, including going from nvidia 511.79 and bios v2.3.0 to the latest nvidia drivers on dell's site (516) and bios v2.9.0.immediate freezing issues, daily.  ran ddu, updated nvidia to 522.  continued freezing issues, but a different bug code generated.  ran ddu again, installed 511.79 and rolled bios back to v2.3.0 (basically undid my original updates out of frustration) and turned off capsule installs so bios will stay at v2.3.0.no issues since.  i intentionally left a game running overnight and while i was at work, no issues.at this point, i'll eventually update the bios to v2.10.0 as i don't think it was the issue.  but the nvidia drivers will stay at 511.79 for the foreseeable future.  unless i experience issues with software, i will not update those drivers again.  looking at the number of complaints around the internet regarding all the various systems and builds, i'm not sure if keeping that driver up to date is the best idea anymore.@erdie yes, you are having a slightly different problem. none with the 'standard' lock ups are able to get anything in the event viewer... total os lock up, even the clock on the lower right of the task bar stops too.....your problem is also odd. those of us who when bios v2.4.0 came out could go back to bios v2.3.0 and that solved the problem. however, loading later bios versions one could not go back to v2.3.0 completely, there was an error that the intel management interface that is part of the bios code could not be updated (no, it can not be back-leveled, and a mismatch of bios code and the intel code could cause unknown problems).also, the time between lock ups on subsequent bios released after v2.4.0 had longer times between lock ups, which made no sense.i'd google the nvidia error you got as well, you could have a h/w error even. no others with the lock up problem seemed to have reboots either like you did? that 30 second delay i suspect the os was writing the dump file. there are ways/programs to read it, but the event viewer would have all the meaningful data as well.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.i'm the linux user who went 59 days without a lockup.  i was hoping i was out of the woods but deep down i knew better.so i don't know that a clean install of windows will do anything.  the problem is not os-specific.  in fact, after one lockup orphaned enough inodes that the system was unusable, i did a clean install of linux and it helped not at all.on nearly every occasion, with journalctl i see an nvida-driver generated error.  the error id is 79 but that's broad enough to not give many clues about what's happening.  there is also the message \"the gpu has fallen off the bus.\"so it could be the nvidia driver, the power supply, the pcie bus .... too many different things.previously, turning the intel turbo option \"off\" seemed to increase the mean time between failure (mbtf). i ran 50 days with turbo \"off\" with no lockup, so i tried turning it to \"on\" (in the bios settings).  i had a lockup after 9 days, but there is nothing definitive about it.  i'm going to leave turbo \"on\" and see if i get relatively frequent lockups.  if i do, i'll try turning it back off.  but i can't say for sure why this would work, and i can't at all claim to find even a partial solution.very, very frustrating, especially as a lockup means the write cache doesn't flush and there could be disk damage ranging up to wrecking the system.@ispalten oh, that's bizarre.  i went from v2.8.0 to v2.3.0 using the copy at dell.comnow admittedly, i bought the pc in the beginning of december, 2021 and had never updated the bios until recently (naughty).  i wonder if one of the bios updates along the way wrecked that ability, and i skipped over it going directly to v2.8?i did read about possible hardware faults that could cause my error.  they mainly pointed toward a faulty motherboard or a faulty ram module.but the fact it never behaved that way before the update, and ultimately returned to being fully functional after putting nvidia 511.79 back on, i'm not as concerned.  that said, i do have an open ticket with dell support with the issue on file, as warranty is approaching.  that way, i figure it's logged as an ongoing issue in case it does deteriorate again.  win memory diag came back clean.  i do have other compatible sticks i could try if it ever comes back, but i'm still using the lowly single rank 2x16gb sticks that came with the system.all i've learned so far is that nvidia drivers now remind me of amd back in the day! @erdie bios updates do not need to be sequential. they are complete versions.i'm using this driver on bios v2.10.0: i didn't have that many lock ups with it. however, i suspect i will at some point and no notice of it being fixed has appeared anywhere?i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.@ispalten the only significant issue i've heard about that driver is game related.  one regarding call of duty, and the other issue being this one:when both nvidia low latency mode is set to ultra in the nvidia control panel and nvidia reflex is set to “boost + enabled” in a game, the graphics card will not return to idle clock speeds after exiting the game until the pc is rebooted. [3846389]seems to be a frequent complaint on the boards.  guessing a hotfix will happen soon.i have the low latency off, so that wouldn't be an issue.there have been many theories here on why and how to fix it. no one has found an error in the event viewer that points to the lock up time (easy to know the time, the system clock stops updating on the systray on the taskbar) now a error dialog window opening? some have gotten dumps or bsod's, but that are not the same error.there is a 'more' stable nvidia driver, the studio one... the main difference is the support of probably most gpu intensive games are in the game ready driver. 'lesser needed' gpu applications should work well with the studio version. nvidia does say they are more 'stable'.. grd's are updated often for new games more than anything else it seems.give the studio driver a try, might work for you. non-game fixes go into that one and it is kept current with the grd drivers.the only really gpu intensive game i have is the ms flight simulator. i did try it with the studio and it was hard to tell if it was any different visually? however, i've had no problems with the grd that i can pin on it, even in the game. i did have the game installed in an external usb drive, and it seemed to work ok, but a few times i had some 'slowness' so i moved it all to an ssd and it is smoother. might go back and give the studio driver a try and run the same scenario on both drivers with geforce performance overlay on and see if there are major differences in heat, fps, or fan speeds under each?i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.\n",

someone suggested to buy a refurbished xps 8930. that is a good suggestion because the 8930 was the last decent xps desktop. i personally do not like windows 11, and i am unsure what i am going to do in 2025. i agree 3 zinc. i am not looking forward to having to go to win 11, and i really like my computer. we have until oct 2025, but i am just asking the question now, so i know what to do in the future.redxps630 already gave a clear, accurate and germane answer to the main question asked.just to add what should be a tiny detail, but one that may bring you to a halt: in order to install that drive into an xps 8950 case, you need a $12 plastic caddy that holds the drive and slides into the cage inside the xps case. trying to buy one from dell is ... an adventure. and not in good way.this may increase the preference for getting a used/refurbished 8930, or something else that's been around for a while. the caddy for that case (which is apparently different) can be found on ebay or various other places, and maybe dell would even deign to sell you one.to add to the chorus...i've been using a borrowed dell laptop that runs win 11 for last ~3 weeks. the lappy has nice hardware but i hate win 11. things that are easy/simple in win 10 are cumbersome, to say the least, in win 11.just gave the laptop back to its owner, and glad to be using my xps 8930, running win 10 22h2, again. not going to think about win 11 until nov-2025, and i suspect microsoft will have released win 12 before then, which -hopefully- fixes all the bad/strange things they did with win 11... ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employee@sj-seattle , 1) topic starter is asking about transferring storage into non-xps pc, thus xps caddy is irrelevant.2) neither xps 8930 nor xps 8950 mentioned on this thread as suggestions by other users absolutely require plastic caddy to firmly fix the drive, caddy is needed only for perfectionists or if you frequently move the drive in and out between various computers (or for some safety reasons described further below)xps 8930 has plenty of holes for fixing drive (of any size: 2.5'' or 3.5'') with bolts: similarly with xps 8950 (but less flexible options) - some holes to fix with bolts (but 8950 needs larger diameter washers or even holes drilled in metal frame)some people even leave it laying flat on a frame without any bolts/caddy fixings, but it's less secure option if you're sometimes moving the case (it won't go anywhere like fall on a mother-board or something,  but loose drive {especially heavier hard-drive} may get cables detached or hit itself against walls leading to possibility of damage). also older devices have electronic circuit exposed at the bottom of the drive and loosened moving position has a risk of shorting components on a controller or causing mechanical damage of those (e.g. if hit by sharp edge or edge of screw). caddy is just for convenience and to eliminate risks during transportation, but not really absolutely needed in most cases (but it's easy to forget it's not there or other people may try to move pc without knowing, e.g. dropping in a car on a backseat or trunk).thanks for this detailed and informative reply. i'm printing these answers out. however: i only have an 8920. i'm about to open this one anyway and replace the power supply. that's why i asked about getting another computer with win 11 and putting in my old secondary drive.\n",

      "content: my new 8950 was just delivered yesterday, spec'd with the lower end gtx 1650 card option thinking that it would include the support bracket for the graphics card.i want to replace it with my own card that's a bit longer and see that it's not there, presumably because the 1650's small enough that it didn't require one. i've contacted dell support to order the part and there are none available for purchase, nor are they even able to provide me with a part number from their system.does anybody have dell part number available for this piece? also, would anyone know if these are the same brackets used on previous generations (8940, 8930, etc) of the xps desktop? thankssolved!go to solution.here is dp/n of gpu bracket in xps 8950.this is different from gpu bracket in xps 8940 which looks like thisx5r5k brkt, holder, rtx3070, pg142view solution in original posti think you mean this support which is dp/n 0742km. available here and here. and a google search turns up a number of other sources.thanks @jocean - i wasn't sure if the new generation 8950 (with the larger volume chassis) used the same part, so that's good to know. appreciate the confirmationhere is dp/n of gpu bracket in xps 8950.this is different from gpu bracket in xps 8940 which looks like thisx5r5k brkt, holder, rtx3070, pg142thanks for that information, i stand corrected.some 8950 unit appear to be shipped without the end gfx holder such as the unit i have seen.  in promotion photo of 8950 there are both end gfx holder and mid gfx bracket.the mid gfx bracket in 8950 looks remarkably similar to that used in aurora r13.  here is dp/n of the mid bracket in r13. 8950 appears to be reincarnation of r13.   like in the old days dell had xps 730x compete with alienware area 51 r1 model based on same dna/chipset, only the aw has more boutique case design with more blings.the gfx end holder seems similar in design to that used in aurora r13.  ps dell uses the same design of psu compartment at bottom in 8950 and r13.  only paint is different.great information, thanks for the detail @redxps630! i didn't see the end support bracket in the 8950 service manual, but that may be another option too. cheersthe end support holder is useful if your card has a dell extension blade as shown in the photos above.the mid gfx bracket assembly appears be customizable.  there are 4 slots in the vertical piece where the horizontal piece can be placed in.  photos show various position of horizontal piece holding either the middle or end of gpu.  this makes sense as the bracket's horizontal piece needs to avoid the 8 pin pcie power connector sockets on the side of gfx, which is variable in position.i understand now, thanks - the extension blade is a part of the graphics card, not of the support holder itself. cheershi, my name is ty, did you ever find out part numbers for brackets and where to purchase them?\n",

      "content: i purchased a dell xps 8950 with no gpu card. this was because high end gpu cards at the time were just too pricey. a lot of used nvidia cards are now flooding the market at pretty reasonable prices. dell does not offer a dell supplied nvidia upgrade option for the xps 8950 (afaik), so i decided to try a couple of used aftermarket cards to see if they would work.the first card i tried was a mid to high end msi geforce gtx 1660 super gaming x card (6gb gddr6 memory). i plugged it in and worked fine. no bios changes were necessary. i am running bios 1.9.0 from december 2022.next, i tried to get more ambitious, upgrading to a high end msi geforce rtx 3090 gaming x trio (24gb gddr6 memory). the card is rated for a 750w psu.the card powers up and starts rotating the lovely led colors, but the dell bios does not see the card at all ('discrete graphics 1: none'). i tried fiddling with the dell bios options: turning off secure boot, and turning on/off the resizable base address register (bar), but no joy. i tried re-arranging the pcie power connectors, tried reseating the card, and everything else i can think of. the 3090 lights up and rotates its pretty led colors, seemingly indicating that it is ready, but the bios simply ignores the card and instead boots to the on-cpu intel 770 gpu. the fact that the card is not even reported in the bios seems to indicate a low level problem. i am wondering if the plug-and-play hardware id for this particular msi retail card is not in the dell bios on-chip database? even with insufficient power it should still post its pnp for display on the bios screen.question: has anyone gotten a retail (non-dell) nvidia rtx 3090 card to successfully work in the xps 8950? if so, which ones?it's very unlikely for bios or xps 8950 to have a white-list approach for dgpu devices.i would test this second-hand rtx 3090 on a different pc first before getting into any conclusions.probably it's also worth double-checking power requirements and comparing with relevant power rails (amps).even though it asks for 750w on gpu requirements side - within say xps 8950 system it might need a bit more than that (e.g. say 1000w psu)4x ddr5 modules can take up to 10wpch 6wvarious usb devices up to 30wvoltage regulator say up to 25w (overprovisioned, depending on cpu).fans/pump 40w.other subsystems/controllers between 20 and 100w (since x4 pcie slot normally has 75w standard).intel cpu i9-12900k can draw up to 240w on some turbo-boost pl modes (but i think it's constrained by dell below that for xps 8950).overclocked rtx 3090 might be running 500w internal tests before showing itself to system.do you start system with test monitor connected to igpu or dgpu? (bios autodetection logic sometimes might play some tricks because of that).+ x6 storage devices on high-load at the same time (unlikely scenario) up to 50w@gideon7 can we assume the monitor is connected to the rtx 3090, and not to the onboard dp port? is this card just doa...?did you try clearing bios ?note: when you reboot, immediately go into bios setup and disable secure boot, which likely got enabled when you reset bios to defaults. if you can't get into bios setup with monitor connected to the card, connect it to the onboard dp port. change/save the bios secure boot setting. then move the monitor to the add-in gpu and see if things work now.if still not working, re-read my question on second line of this post....ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employee\n",

      "content: hello,my dell xps 8930 will not power up. the power button on the front of the machine is dark. i first thought it was the psu because when i pressed the check button on the psu the green light would not come on. i ordered a new psu and after installing it has the same problem. then i plugged my power cord into the old psu while it was out of the pc and pressed the check button and the green light came on. so, not a bad psu?i then reinstalled the old psu and reconnected everything and still no power and now the green light on the back of the power supply will not come on.  so i thought is must be a connection somewhere. i left all my connections to hard drives, fans and such in place but left the p1 connection on the mother board off. then pressed the check power button on the back of the psu and the green light came on and the fan and hd started spinning. what does this indicate? bad mother board? bad cmos battery?  any help would be appreciated.thanksif after removing the cables from the system board and the psu led illuminates, one of the attached devices or components could be faulty. remove all attached components, reattach the psu cables and using the psu test button, install each component individually to test.https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000125609/resolve-no-power-no-post-no-boot-or-no-video-issu...that is exactly what i did.  the psu test light came on with all components attached except the ps1 connection from the power supply to the mother board.  when i connect the ps1 connector from the power supply to the mother board, the test light does not illuminate. does this indicate the motherboard is bad?  is there another way to test the mother board?that is exactly what i did.  the psu test light came on with all components attached except the ps1 connection from the power supply to the mother board. . .  you already confirmed after you removed the psu from the chassis and with the power cord connected, the led test light came onso redxps630's suggestion was: thanks for your help.ok.  i disconnected all the components from the power supply and tested the psu.  the green light came on.  then i connected both power sources to the mother board and the tested again.  the green light did not come on. i then disconnected the p1 power source but left the p2 power source connected and the the green light on the psu came on.  see photos.  thoughts?so with the main motherboard power cable (p1) connected, and the cpu power cable (p2) connected, your desktop has no signs of power when pressing the power button. the led on the power on button is dark, there're no led diagnostics lights blinking in a pattern, no fan noise heard, and if you have a secondary disk drive that's an hdd, no sound of it spinning up.basically there's no sign of power with either one of the two psu's installed. right? if you haven't already, its worth trying to drain the residual power to see if it might be causing the power problem  [edit] : on my xps8930, i have to turn the lights off in the room and cup my hand around the light to see since its so dimly lit  thanksi did the power drain procedure as suggested but no change.  no. if p2 is connected there is power. the fans will run and the disc will spin when pushing the test button on the psu.  if p1 is connected there is no power at all when pushing the test button on the psu. so some things you can look to try so you eliminate these possibilities first as being the power problem are (in sequential order) :1.reset the bios2.replace the power button module      i don't know when or \"if\" you replaced the cmos battery. by ruling out the cr2032 (3 v) battery first you can then move on to replacing the power button module.when you reset the bios, the same bios version will remain that you're at now. all that will change are any bios settings you might've made, i.e, the bios settings will return to the default settings. its better to buy a battery in a store so that you can see the expiration date (ed) on it. maxell, panasonic, sony are very good. steps to reset the biosbtw, while you're replacing the battery, re-seating the ram modules would be a good idea too if you haven't tried that. if the desktop power still doesn't come on, install only one module in the second slot from the cpu. continue to test all other ram modules, one at a time, in the second slot to identify which might be a bad module.============================removing the power button modulereplacing the power button module involves quite a bit of dismantling - the optical drive, the top, & the side panel, and the front bezel. . . the dell part number is 37jgh. the thing to keep in mind when buying this is that you're ordering from re-sellers who may or may not be selling the the entire assembly e.g,  switch, cable, front panel connector plug, and the housing piece that secures the button to the chassis. . . this recent thread on the xps desktop fourm includes a link to purchase on ebay. but as @redxps630  mentioned in that thread, it would be prudent to contact the seller first and ask what all is included.        i forgot to mention that after replacing the motherboard battery, keep in mind that it will require setting the correct time in the main tab of the bios. the date may stay correct, but check to see if that also needs to be changed   \n",

      "content: windows 11 did an update last week and after the update the computer did not power back on. i attempted to restart it manually and it did not work. i followed the instructions for a reset - disconnect power and peripherals and hold down power button for 30 seconds and then reconnect and try again. didn't work. i changed out the battery. still did not work. if i hold down the power test button on the power supply and press the front button and hold it briefly the system powers up as usual with no issues. it has run for over a week that way with no issues. i checked bios and it is set to power on after a power outage - just in case that's relevant. so everything works fine but if it loses power i have to do the same process to get it restarted. a warm boot works fine. diagnostics shows no issues. the only problem i have is that it wont power on from the front button. any suggestions? it is out of warranty and i have ordered a new computer but would still like to use that one for daily stuff like email and web browsing. any suggestions that i may have missed in my searches? thanks in advance.xps 8930, i7-9700, geforce rtx 206re: if i hold down the power test button on the power supply and press the front button and hold it briefly the system powers up as usual with no issues.try clear cmos settings via motherboard cmos clr jumper.no difference - i have seen people complain about bios upgrade 1.1-27 - i am on 1.1-23.  i have found another thread on another site where two or three other people have the same issue - no resolution yet.  so i upgraded windows 11 which has been installed for over a year and after the update the pc wanted a restart - it didnt come back.  diagnostics show no issues and it runs fine after i get it powered on.  its just annoying to have to do that.  after i reset cmos it wanted to setup bios and powered down and i had to do the same thing to get into bios - updated bios and it left to start and didnt come back and had to hold the power self test and front panel to get it back up.  seems like i am not the only one with the issuetry what you have already done but may not be done in correct sequence:(1) battery already replaced with a brand new cr2032(2) unplug power cord, press power button for 30 sec to drain flea power(3) do not plug in power cord, clear cmos settings via cmos clr jumper(4) now plug in power cord and try press power button on front panelsounds -to me- like either an ailing power button module or an ailing psu ...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeesame result - it is just weird that once it runs it runs fine and no diagnostic errors.  holding down the power button for a few seconds does result in power down - just it seems to have no effect on power upthanks for the assistance still could be button module or psu...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeone 8920 user reported same thing and said “i went ahead and cleared cmos and changed the battery. so far after 2 shut downs, the computer started up without having to hit the bist button. fingers crossed that this was the cause.”so make sure your replacement battery is brand new and try clear cmos a couple of times just to be sure.  if still no change, it is an obstinate pc.  if i were you i would live with it, it is a nuisance that you need to press power button +psu bist button to start the pc. yeah the only problem is when upgrading bios or windows update it reboots and not sure how it would impact bios updates.  i already ordered an 8950 because it was time to upgrade but planned on leaving this as a backup to replace an optiplex 9020 which wont support windows 11 - i basically have one machine for video/photo editing and another one for day to day stuff.  i would pay for a new power supply - about $100 - but would want to know i was fixing the problem and not just throwing money at it.  there is a reddit thread with other users having the same issue so i am thinking it might be bios related somehow - i am on 1.1-23 and i know 1.1-27 caused issues - i am hesitant to upgrade it now.  also the bios has bios backup to hard drive enabled so maybe it is the bios and when i clear the cmos it just downloads the bad stuff from the hard drive again.  have not tried disabling that and clearing cmos. re: yeah the only problem is when upgrading bios or windows update it reboots and not sure how it would impact bios updates.can the pc reboot/restart without issue?  i was under the impression that the issue is with a cold start.i doubt the psu is the root cause.  you can test it by using a spare working 24/4 pin atx psu of any power from an old desktop pc, but i understand some user does not have such a spare test psu.\n",

      "content: first my cv. i'm an msee avionics system/hardware/software design engineer and do have at least a small clue about good design.there have been a few posts regarding difficulties bringing up the bios menu or the one-time boot menu at system power-on. after spending literally hours working this issue including random shutdowns and spending more than 4 hours with on-line support (more on this later) i found most of the problem. the root of most of the problems appears to be in the default system and bios settings. of course, resolving the bios setting problems requires being able to get into the bios menu in the first place.the first step is to connect a single monitor to either the on-board or graphics card hdmi output. i've found that either hdmi output works. in my case i have multiple monitors connected to nvidia geforce rtx 3060 ti displayport 1.4a ports and needed to connect a single monitor to one of  the hdmi outputs.the second step is, as said in a couple of other posts, restart or power the pc on and tap the f2 key. this can take several attempts and is part of the dell design failure.once you are able to bring the bios menu up do the following:so there are two mistakes made by dell here. the first includes the fact that the bios only operates the hdmi outputs for a single monitor at boot and that is undocumented in the user’s manual. the second is a default bios setting that makes it almost impossible for the bios to recognize an active f2 or f12 key.a previous post mentioned, and i confirmed that the default power management settings for devices that can be power managed are set to enabled in the device manager. i have disabled the cpu ability to power manage all devices. this is a dell factory setup error for desktops. makes sense for battery operated laptops, but is unnecessary for a desktop (that setting for a desktop is not going to save the climate.) i have not run my system long enough to confirm that removing power management control resolves random shut-downs or lockups.this is for dell. i’ve built me own systems for more than 30 years. i decided to purchase a dell system since you are the preferred supplier for the company work for and were offering a deal on systems. i expected the system to operate without serious issue out of the box. this is not the case. initial overall grade which includes the system, system documentation, and system support is a ‘d’. the system alone if it now works as it should is a ‘b’. this is why.@nictesla i'm sure you know what you are doing. however, i wonder why you had the problem entering the bios? when i got mine, i had to go into the bios and slow it down from 10 to 5? not only once, but i had 2 other motherboards put into my xps8940 and on each one, the bios was set to 10?if it was defaulted to 0, i'd think your problem would be reported here by a lot more people?i'm wondering if you did get a new one or one used by someone else or a refurbished unit?could check the bios, under general, system information, and see the ownership date. should match or be close to the date you first turned on the xps?i am assuming you are having the 'common' nvidia/bios lock ups... requiring a use of the power button off and on to regain operation of the xps. common thought was that the devices power setting in device manager was the cause, display or even the mouse/keyboard would go to sleep and by setting all devices for power management off it would solve the problem, never did....i agree it is not needed for a desktop, but i'm not even sure dell is the culprit? could be windows itself? i've seen other sites asking the same question for devices i recall? i'm not even sure leaving it enabled would cause a real problem other than a second or two for the device to wake up when 'used'? i even found verizon (https://www.verizon.com/support/knowledge-base-14375/ ) had a page on this, and it didn't mention dell specifically?i was told by support though when i first reported the lock up problem to use the hd750 (i connect via hdmi) and not my nvidia rtx2060. i could go into bios and set the intel as the primary display, but it isn't needed to do that. i could just disable the nvidia in device manager. should always leave on multidisplay case your display or video card dies. seems for hdmi the ports are tied together and the discrete card would default to the intel? strange, but that seems to be the way it works? not sure for display port? i guess you discovered it doesn't?as for the lock up and the need to power off and on the xps, many of us have that problem, and it was due to bios v2.4.0 change... before that, no lock ups... once your bios is updated past that, it seemed only if you back-level to v2.3.0 on that bios would you not experience the lock up. any other version, going back was no longer the cure... lock ups still happened, and as releases after v2.4.0 came out, the time between lock ups got longer with each one it seems. i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.my system was built and delivered by the dell factory on march 22, 2022. i defined the system bios version in the original post. the factory default setting for post delay is 0 secs.i don't know if the changes i made resolve the lockup or random shut-down only the changes i made and running the system to see if that resolved the problem. the community posts indicate that this has been a problem since ver 2.4. i would expect that the problem would have been resolved well before ver 2.10. that tells me that whomever is working this, doesn't have a clue as to the cause after almost 2 years. in my business i'd be looking for new developers.besides providing a solution to the bios and onetime boot access issue (and there have been several posts on google) i am letting dell know that i for one expect an out-of-the-box system to work without issues that impair the usefulness of the system as well as to point out issues with dell's online support. if dell is expecting the online user community to be beta testers and solve their issues, the contributors should be compensated. when i build my own system, i expect to spend a little time to work out issues. i don't expect to have to do that with an oem system.i'm sorry, i reread your original post and do not the the bios version?not that it matters... if you never updated the bios, it probably shipped in 3/2022 with the v2.4.0 one. if you are still on it, you can go back to v2.3.0 and the lock ups will be gone.also, i never had the bios set for 0 on my xps at all?all sorts of changes, in the os, in the bios, even on the video card. none have worked. i you do find one, many people would be glad to know what it was, that is for sure.if you happen to be on bios v2.10.0, well, i can go weeks, even over a month with no lock up (just had one yesterday and the one before it was over 2 weeks ago), so you'll need some run time before declaring you found the fix....compensate anyone, i doubt it. i'd be glad if they fixed it!i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.\n",

      "content: in week three of ownership of an xps 8950 (i7, 32gb, 3060i, 750w) and it's been a good experience. from the start, i noticed that the tidal pc app would disconnect during music playback about every 3-5 minutes, and remain in a disconnected state. my audio pipeline is xps 8950, yamaha/steinberg asio driver, usb out, usb in on yamaha dac/amp - home wifi network. this combo of audio hardware/software/network, and their settings, worked perfectly with my previous laptop since joining tidal last january.at first, i faulted the tidal pc app, as it actually disconnects, and throws an error \"chosen audio output has been disconnected\". nothing is disconnected as far as i can tell. i have been working with the tidal tech team to diagnose this problem - no fixes yet.but, over the past few weeks, i've tried other audio apps, such as foobar 2000, tidal web app, and tidal android app (running on win11) and while these apps don't \"disconnect\", there is a noticeable audio dropout of about 1-2 seconds on the same cadence - about every 3-5 minutes. maybe these other apps \"handle\" the dropout better than the tidal pc app?  they have a dropout, but then keep playing - the tidal pc app remains disconnected.this leads me to think that there's something happening with the xps 8950 that is causing the audio disconnects/dropouts. so now i am looking into every setting that could cause a sleep or similar-type state in the xps 8950 usb ports, interfaces, everywhere. a quick look into online posts, and i see a history of xps 8950/xps 8940 issues with audio, and people talking about the gpu drivers causing similar issues.first, i am going to exhaust all possible settings that could lead to an idle or sleep state, causing the disconnect. after that, i am up to whatever you folks suggest. maybe this has been resolved already?i really need to be able to listen to audio for more than just a few minutes without dropouts. i've been able to do this for decades, on far less capable/expensive hardware. if i can't make this happen, i'll be returning this machine.tia for any help you can provide!solved!go to solution.@billyjk   - you'd only need the nvidia driver if you're using audio over hdmi/dp to speakers in the monitor, but don't uninstall it.have you looked for an updated y/s driver?what \"junk\" is running in the background?you can try this: go to start>run>services.msc and disable all \"dell\" services and all \"killer\" (ethernet/wifi) and xtend services too.  you don't need any killer/xtend stuff running and imo killer internet works better without any of those killer/xtend services.  also go to startup tab in task manager and disable killer entries there too.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeview solution in original postbeen running audio and watching task manager to see if anything is occurring with services at the time of each disconnect.  turns out, there is.  it's wavessyssvc.i disabled this service as a startup service yesterday, but somehow it has restarted itself, and appears to be at the \"scene of the crime\" each time.next, i'll try to uninstall all of the waves maxx stuff.all waves stuff is gone, and i've tried many, many tweaks that i've found online.  still, the disconnects continue, every 3-5 minutes.  all usb ports have been set to not go to sleep, hibernation is turned off, even have tried different usb ports on the back of my 8950.  i have also tried different config settings in the yamaha/steinberg usb driver.  frustrating.one dell owner using the same usb audio driver turned off his turbo boost and disabled the c-state control.  i can't find either of those settings, maybe a different model?i'll keep digging...it is not your machine ...it is tidal https://www.google.com/search?q=tidal+pc+app+drop cool setup. my aurora-r6 audio setup is fairly basic (but foobar2000 and sacd ripping is fine).but i've got my aurora-r1 connected via hdmi to my onkyo-avr in home-theater. i use it for kodi and windows-gaming.https://www.dell.com/community/rockstars-central/optiplex-7010-mt-windows-media-player/m-p/8125222/h...i see tidal in plex. i can get to plex from my browser, but i really only run it from my apple-tv. seems fine. isn't it just a music streaming service?. are you connected via a real ethernet-cable?

      "content: almost two years ago in a thread i started, i referenced a dell support article's steps for creating a bios recovery on a usb key. the steps mention downloading a bios .exe file on a desktop, and re-naming the file & extension to bios_img.rcv.i pointed out a caveat mentioned in the article regarding the bios. it states that if your bios is a dell bios, then the instructions can be followed.  but if it is a bios supplied by another manufacturer, a bios recovery file had to be requestedmy concern back then fell on deaf ears when i pointed out that based on the article's description of a dell bios versus a bios supplied by another manufacturer, mine and every other 8930 user’s bios were supplied by another manufacturer. so a conclusion back then was if the steps to create a bios recovery key don't recover the bios in the event when the time came, that could spell disaster.   and if i attempted to download the .rcv file instead of the exe file from dell support, the browser would only fill with code jibberish   i was being asked why do you even want to create a bios recovery usb anyway? i couldn’t recall anyone posting a thread on the xps desktops forum in recent memory where someone recovered the bios using a bios recovery key.the default search location for the bios recovery image is on an external usb drive. so if the usb drive is not present and detected, the recovery image on the hard disk drive is used, but with exceptions :  (1) the hard drive wasn’t replaced from the factory drive, (2) you didn’t change the bios from uefi to legacy boot, (3) you didn’t re-image the pc since it was purchased, (4) you haven’t re-installed a new os and formatted the drive. fast forwarding to the presentwhen reading threads and comments that came about where many users began experiencing a no post and black screen caused by 1.1.27,  i was taken back that so many were able to successfully recover using the downloaded .exe file and re-naming it on a usb stick.that was basically the point i was driving home in my old thread that fell on deaf ears.you could say this is a technical definition of an anomaly to be able to recover with a usb recovery key that users created having an aptio by american megatrends bios, i.e, non-dell bios.i don’t dispute that all of dell’s documentation is not completely accurate.\n",

      "content: hi, i just realized that after 7-8 years later the cpu is not really that much faster compare between i7-3770 and amd r9 3900x. just wondering if it is at all possible to fit an nvidia rtx 3080 with xps 8500 (the original motherboard)? i think it would not fit right? thoughts? even if it would fit, i guess it probably would not make sense to have such a powerful gpu to pair with such slow cpu and memory, correct? i have upgraded my xps 8500 with ssd and 32gb of ram so it's running very smoothly now.1. what's the fastest gpu (graphics card) you can fit into an dell xps 8500 *without* have to upgrade the psu (power supply)? would gtx 1650 absolutely the best choice (or is there any other \"better\" choice)?2. what's the fastest gpu (graphics card) you can fit into an dell xps 8500 if also upgrading the psu, and what watt of psu i need to get (750w or 1000w?), and what brand/model of psu would fit with the original xps 8500 case?lots of threads about upgrading the gpu in the xps 8500. search for them. here's one to get you started.don't know size limit on gpu in the xps 8500, but the rtx 3080 is 11.2\" (285 mm) long.seems unlikely an xps 8500 with a 3rd gen intel cpu can adequately support an rtx 3080, with even if you upgrade the psu (650 or 750 w recommended, depending on exact card).there are still questions whether the new dell xps 8940 pc with 10th gen intel cpu will support an rtx 30xx series card...edit: and dell is unlikely to test any rtx 30xx cards in pcs like the xps 8500 which are at their end of support.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeei put a 1660 super in my 8500 a couple years ago and it works fine. it did require me to put in a new power supply. i put in a 750.  i have a ssd and 32gb ram.  but this setup is marginal running x-plane 12.  so now i'm looking into a 2000 series gpu, such as the 2060.there is a lot more to a \"fast computer\" than just main-processor speed.a xps-8500 is missing so much core-tech and abilities to even a current/modern mid-range desktop computer ... it would be hard to list them all.\n",

      "content: good evening everyone,i have a dell xps 8930 that shows only a black screen when i turn it on.  (forgive me for not being very technical.)  i have searched forums and have done a few troubleshooting steps including windows key + ctrl + shift + b, without any effect.  i connected a television as a monitor and got the response \"no signal.:  when i disconnected the original monitor, i got a message on the monitor that the monitor would shut down in 5 minutes.  the keyboard lights would change status when i keyed the num lock and caps lock key.  i used another computer on the same wifi to access the router and saw the xps 8930 connected to the internet.  i had noticed that the computer got loud over the last few months.  my spouse confirmed that when he was editing photos that he noticed that there was a loud fan noise frequently lately.  does this sound like a gpu that has gone bad?  if so, is there a gpu that i can buy and install that will fix this problem?  i read in these forums that if a gpu is not oem that it might not work unless something is overridden.  since i don't have a display, i won't be able to change settings.  many thanks in advance to the gurus on this forum.this forum post and this one have advice on which gpu to choose as compatible. you could try reseating the gpu but based on your information it is possible the card is bad. just curious though, does the fan on the gpu run properly?the information you provided does lack some details to be able to understand what's going onfirst of all, when you power on the system do you see the dell logo ?  does it power on and self test and go to windows. . . and then the screen becomes black?do you remember if you have recently seen in windows update before this all started if a firmware update was installed through windows update? dell firmware version 0.1.1.27 have you recently changed anything regarding how you connect your display to your xps 8930  ?what (make/model) of display monitor do you have?    re: does this sound like a gpu that has gone badtry remove the discrete gpu aka graphics card from your 8930 and connect video cable to onboard hdmi or dp video port.  if the discrete gpu is indeed bad, and the rest of pc is booting fine based on observation that router detects it connected to network, you ought to get normal video from onboard video port.re: if so, is there a gpu that i can buy and install that will fix this problem? yes and you can decide what to buy depending on what you need the gpu for.  if for 4k display only but not gaming, buy a simple gpu that supports 4k. if for gaming, many options and i would suggest take this opportunity to upgrade gpu above your current one if that has indeed gone bad.  btw a loud fan noise could be from multiple sources.  if gpu fan was loud it suggests overheating.  when you test pc by removing the gpu, gpu fan noise should be gone.  if still hear it, the noise can be either cpu cooler or chassis fan. thank you for your reply.  no logo shows up when i power on the system.  nothing shows up at all.i don't recall if a firmware update was installed unfortunately.  i have it setup to automatically install updates and that usually happens when my spouse uses the computer and he doesn't pay attention to the updates.we haven't changed how we connect the display for over a year.  the monitor is a dell s2240l.thanks.thank you.  i will try your suggestions (possibly not today though) and advise on how it goes.i actually opened up the computer today and discovered that there is nothing in the  pci-express x16 card slot.  does that mean that the onboard video port has gone bad and that i need to install a gpu into the pci-express x16 card slot?  (as i mentioned, i'm not too technical and i'm about to give up and contact dell or best buy because i don't want to <profanity removed. tos73>)since the system starts up to a black screen and you aren't getting a dell logo, (or i'm assuming any startup error either because you didn't mention that you were), then the cpu and motherboard power connections are likely okay.if you moved your pc around and it received of nice jolt, the gpu or also the ram modules not being seated properly could cause the black screen problem. but don't re-seat the gpu and ram sticks just yetfollow the instructions from redxps630's post first.if you've never removed the card before, there's one blue tab on one end of the card slot holding the card when its inserted in the slot on the motherboard. you need to push that blue tab in the direction away from the card slot before you can pull the card out. when you have to re-insert the card back in, that blue tab will lock into place by itself once you insert the card back into the slot.then connect your hmdi or dp cable to the integrated graphics port on your pc and into your monitor. on my xps 8930, the integrated graphics is an hmdi port. all my other ports are to the nvidia card.  then power on the pc and if you get the dell logo and then to the windows splash screen, you know your gpu was bad           it would be a good idea to take it to best buy geek squad for an opinion.since you do not see any discrete gpu inside pc, it shows you have always used onboard video port before which was working until recently.  it can be due to a corrupted bios or other thing wrong w motherboard.  you do not need to get a discrete video card to help diagnosis or repair now.  what this forum often recommends to users in this situation could be over technical, but if you are interested in knowing some of them just for discussion not necessarily doing it yourself, first unplug power from pc, press power button for 30 sec to drain power, replace cmos battery with a new battery cr2032 ($1-2), clear cmos settings by moving motherboard jumper pins, and if still no video, attempt a dell bios recovery.  the last three steps mentioned can be a bit technical i admit.i did the steps regarding replacing the cmos battery and unfortunately it didn't work.  i could see lights lighting up and heard the computer doing its thing but still no signal to the monitor.  i will bring it to someone to diagnose it in a few days.\n",

      "content: xps 8500/8700 (h77 and z87 chipset) came with dell small 32gb msata + 250-500gb sata hdd hybrid caching setup.  so was inspiron 15z (hm77 chipset).  this was the original idea behind such scheme:a hybrid hdd/ssd caching setup has some usability benefits. owing to the relatively high cost of solid-state drives, pc users commonly pair a midsize ssd with a larger hard-disk drive, dedicating the ssd to handling the operating system and frequently used applications and data, while using the hdd for bulk storage. such a configuration provides excellent overall performance and storage capabilities, but it requires the user to manage multiple drive letters and if the ssd runs low on space–to move data manually from the ssd to the hard drive and back. in contrast, smart response technology hides all or part of the ssd from the operating system, and it caches data automatically. no additional drive letters are necessary, and data moves dynamically to and from the ssd based on individual usage patterns. the result is a system that delivers ssd-like performance and hdd-like capacities, without the user’s having to manage multiple drive letters.  so in this scheme there is only one drive letter although two physical drives: small ssd + large hdd.intel smart response technology is a caching mechanism that uses a small solid state drive like old fashioned msata, 2.5” sata or m.2 ssd, or intel optane memory, to enhance overall system performance and simplify the drive configuration presented to the end-user. the cache can be linked to the boot drive in a system, regardless of the capacity or the drive type.system requirements:• intel® z87, q87, h87, z77, q77, h77 express chipset-based desktop board (not limited to these)• intel® coretm processor in the lga1155 or lga1150 package (not limited to these)• system bios with sata mode set to raid• intel rapid storage technology software 10.5 version release or later• single hard disk drive (hdd) (or multiple hdd’s in a single raid volume)• solid state drive (ssd) with a minimum capacity of 18.6gb• operating system: microsoft windows 8 or windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit editions) (not limited to these)questions1) whether such technology of yesterday still applies to windows 10. yes, it still works in windows 10.  there are at least 6 dell pc models of those chipset still kicking today, so it is relevant.  xps 8500/8700, optiplex 7010/7020, 9010/9020 (not 3010/3020 which has h61/h81 chipset)2) whether it works in newer 90/100/200 series or higher chipset. yes it works in at least intel z97, z170, z270 q170, q270 chipset.  all these chipset says clearly note: srt is done under “raid” but is not raid 0 in the traditional settingintel srt is a feature under umbrella of intel rapid storage tech (rst)configuring your computer for intel smart response technology is a 3-step process:1. configure sata mode for raid in bios setup2. install the operating system on the hdd (not ssd), and install the intel rapid storage technology software version 10.5 or later.3. enable intel smart response technologyps criticism of this old tech\n",

there's been users who've posted on other forums that it has worked (for them) to correct this issue.it was my understanding dell gpu cards are clocked slightly lower than the reference specs. nvidia specs for my gpu clock are 1506 mhz and the gpu boost of 1708 mhz.perhaps trying msi afterburner to lower the core clock to a negative (-) boost range may workboth gpu-z tech power up and hdwinfo64 sensors read the graphics clock of 1911 mhz. i wouldn't consider messing around with undervoltaging since i'm informed enough to know of the possible cause of damage to the gpu.  anyone tried underclocking and if so, did it work to fix black screens, and critical error 4101 \"display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered\" ?     hwinfo64gpu-z tech power-up                       solved!go to solution.@ispalten, @tesla1856 for what its worth, i thought i'd provide an update.perhaps some others in the future might benefit who're having the same issue i had.the problem was that while there were no processes or applications drawing resources from the nvidia gpu as evident in the windows task manager gpu performance data,  the data from the sensors read from gpu-z (and also hwinfo64) showed the video engine load (stuck? perhaps) at 100%. the temperature was running up there,  the base clock was astronomically higher above the dell spec of 1507mhz.  and the fan speed was running way out there.turns out it was due to the previous bios version. i flashed the new bios version 1.1.26 copied onto a usb stick from the one-time boot menu.then i took the sensors reading with gpu-z. the video engine load, temperature, base clock, and fan all dropped. the pcle slot voltage is even back up to + 12 v along with the 6-pin power cable voltage up to  +12v .   a lot of sleep lost over a problem i had no control over. how many others may have the same issue without knowing, who knows? i never did try underclocking with msi afterburner. didn't want to start another problem by tweaking on the clock until i narrowed down the cause.  stuck to my gunsi did try one minor tweak but i didn't see it having any affect. before updating the bios, i changed the power management mode in nvidia cp from maximum performance to optimal.  so far, i think i'll leave it set at optimal . .. overriding windows power settingafter upgrading to bios v 1.1.26before upgrading (bios v 1.1.24)view solution in original postnot really, however (i think related), my:msi nvidia gtx-1070 (gaming-x ) 8gbis an over-clockable card, but i have always (intentionally) never really turned-on the oc much, and just run it at \"stock clocks\". it's already very fast, runs cool under heavy utilization, and rock-solid. i ran it under windows-7 and now windows-10, with various nvidia whql drivers over the years, and it runs excellent.i also have a dell-oem gtx-1070 (back blower) in this aurora-r6. it also runs at stocks clocks and is very stable. i had a little issue recently, but i don't think it was the actual video-card, as it is fine now (after being re-seated):https://www.dell.com/community/alienware-desktops/aurora-r6-hardware-error-nvidia-gtx-1070/m-p/82794...@djh301 not sure what you are running when you took that data?

      "content: this is a new 1 on me. this unit has never given me a minute's worth of trouble in the 3 or 4 years i've had it. yesterday the standard windows 11 pro desktop was up as usual; i left for about an hour and was greeted by a dell logo on a black screen when i got back. i figured it was just a windows update that had not quite completed or something but when i rebooted i got the same thing. since then i've gone through a litany of troubleshooting steps as follows:1. verified the power supply was good (no beeps or visual error codes and tried it out on another computer also) all the fans spin-up when the power button is pushed and also when the test button on the rear of the actual psu is pushed. the led stays green and doesn't flash.2. the power button led on the front of the computer stays solid white and does not change color nor beep nor flash any error codes.3. verified that the memory was good (no beeps or visual error codes and tried it out on another computer).4. changed out the video card for a known good one. also tried using the integrated hdmi port as well. (not even the dell logo appears when i do this, for some reason)5. changed out the ssd for a couple of known good ones. a different known good one is currently installed.6. the only cables which are attached are the video (hdmi), usb keyboard & mouse ones. no sata hard drives are attached, either.7. reset the bios via the mobo jumper and also by removing the coin-cell battery and power cord for 10 minutes. did this 3 different times for good measure8. no post whatsoever and i can't even access the bios setup, either by f2 or f12. it flashes briefly in the lower right-hand corner of the screen and that's it. i've tried moving the usb keyboard & mouse cables to different ports (usb 2 & 3) but to no avail. i've done this more times than i can count.so in summary, this happened quickly, in about an hour's time; prior to this the computer had exhibited no ill symptoms whatsoever in all the time i've owned it. i've had it connected to a functional apc ups the entire time i've owned it, so it has not been subjected to power spikes, etc. the bios had not been flashed anytime recently but the last time it was, no problems were encountered. no error codes, either visual (leds) or audible (beeps) have manifested themselves. no new hardware or software has been installed lately. the computer pretty much just has windows 11 pro and office home & business 2021 (click-to-run, not office 365). the cpu is an i7 with 32gb of ram. to me everything seems to point to a failed motherboard but apparently there aren't any diagnostics (at least that i have access to) to absolutely confirm this. it's more-or-less the \"process of elimination\" at this point but before i drop a wad of cash on a replacement mobo (probably without a return privilege) i thought i'd see if anybody out there in dell land had any other ideas or perhaps have had a similar experience; this is a 1st for me. i'm attaching some pictures, for whatever little it might be worth. thanks in advance...dell logo on monitordell xps 8930 i7 motherboarddell led on back of power supply unitsolved!go to solution.@rohe i had hoped to repport that the steps to recover the bios and get back to a usable computer worked but sadly not yet.the steps with the .rcv file on a usb drive inserted into a port, turning on the pc and hitting ctrl-esc worked - i got the bios recovery menu and successfully recovered the bios, according to the final screen in the process (photo).and so the system restarted, four or five times, starting with a screen saying windows updates in progress - i guess a literal continuation of what was happeneing with windows update right before the bios corruption a few days ago.after another restart, the dell logo appeared with text beneath saying a system update was being installed (photo). no idea what this is. the bios?there was one restart where the dell logo appeared and underneath was the spinner animation suggesting windows might load.during all this, the usb drive was still inserted and i could see the flashing light indicating drive activity. i guessed the system was accessing data on the drive although the only file there is the .rcv one.but i eventually stopped the machine (turned it off) as it seemed to be stuck in this position: dell logo on screen and nothing else going on other than the usb drive being constantly accessed.i have a fundamentral question - should i remove the usb drive after the bios flash update succeeds, before the machine actually restarts?  or does it not matter. and , fyi. all the peripherals usually connected to this pc were unplugged except for the wired keyboard and the hdmi-connected monitor.i need to do this again which is fine as i learn as i go view solution in original post@travis_lloyd  - it's more like microsoft decided we're too lazy and/or stupid to keep our pcs updated, so we need a nanny to do it for us.@sam55todd  - i don't think password protecting bios will stop nanny microsoft from installing a bios update as long as uefi capsule updates is enabled.  and i don't think a bios password will stop supportassist/dell update from doing it either. i keep capsule updates disabled (no bios password set) and i've uninstalled supportassist/dell update too.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeview solution in original postuser reported recent windows update automatically push out dell bios 1.1.27 update that is not found on dell website.  it is possible when you walked away windows thought a good moment to do a firmware update but the ai failed during a supposedly smooth update.  try bios recoveryre:reset the bios via the mobo jumper and also by removing the coin-cell battery and power cord for 10 minutes.you can also try replace cmos battery with a new one, but if a bios flash had failed there was not much you could do with a bricked motherboard.thanks. i'll give it a try but i'm not very hopeful at this point, given what all i've tried so far. i did forget to mention in my post that i have already replaced the coin battery with a new one as part of my troubleshooting efforts (which obviously didn't help). the bios was \"flashed-up\" to whatever the latest version was on the dell website but that was done whenever it was first released and nowhere near to when the problem occurred . as mentioned, i have reset the bios several times already, both via the jumper on the mobo and by removing the battery and power cable, in this case for 15 minutes each time. i was not aware that microsoft could put out a bios update via windows update that had not been \"officially\" released on the dell support website.i forgot to mention that i installed a new battery and cleared the cmos in both ways that you suggested already, as part of my troubleshooting. interesting development after holding down the ctrl + esc keys (something that i have previously not heard of before - what does it do - or trigger, exactly?). after doing so (and for the first time) the power button flashes amber in two groups, 3 times and then 6 times. according to the service manual this combo indicates \"recovery image not found\" (although it's in the reverse order that is listed in the manual) which could well be the case. and i've now tried it with 2 of my known-good \"test ssds\". however, that still doesn't explain why i'm locked out of the bios or why it won't boot, since both ssds are formatted and bootable on another similar dell desktop with windows 11 pro. on the other hand, a single 3-flash group indicates \"system board or chipset failure\" and a single 6-flash group indicates \"video card or chip failure\". i don't know what, if any, the order of the flashing groups has to do with what the actual problem is, vis-a-vis the diagnostic codes, but the 3-flash group always preceeds the 6-flash group every time. so the bottom line is that i'm getting a little more info now than i was before but it's still not really telling what the problem could be per se. if i don't use the ctrl + esc key combo then it goes back to a solid white led on the power button. logically i still don't understand what could've caused such a catastrophic failure when it was simply sitting there idle, connected to a functional ups and there was no bad weather or power outages or anything. still seems a bit bizarre under the circumstances that it could just die like that...put the bios recovery image .rcv file for bios 1.1.26 on an empty fat32-formatted usb stick. do not change the file name from bios_img.rcv to anything else.plug that usb into pc with power fully off. power on and use ctrl-esc and -hopefully- you can launch the bios recovery now.  leave pc alone until it's back at your desktop.fwiw, bios 1.1.27 is available for xps 8930 on dell's support page as of today, 12-12-22.  i would not use the recovery file for this newest version, since we don't know -yet- if 1.1.27 has a problem.and once you recover the pc, open bios setup and do the following:confirm bios recovery from hard drive is enableddisable uefi capsule updates - to prevent windows update from installing bios updates, which should be installed only via the f12 flash update option and a usb stick, to be safe.enable bios auto-recoveryenable always perform integrity checkkeep in mind that these settings get reset to their defaults after every bios update so you have to check them again, after each bios update...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employee1. connected to a functional apc ups 2. according to the service manual this combo indicates \"recovery image not found\" (although it's in the reverse order that is listed in the manual)1. props for doing this.2. try to determine if it's this error or the other one. if this one, you should attempt to follow the dell bios recovery 2/3 procedures.you can also try leaving it un-powered, no cmos battery installed, flea-power dissipated  for a few hours. see if dell bios guard will kick-in on next power-up.@travis_lloyd  fyi -  the link i posted above for the xps 8930 bios 1.1.26 recovery file isn't working correctly on my xps 8930. it crashes firefox or just downloads gibberish. if you have the same problem, download bios 1.1.26 .exe from here.copy the .exe file onto the empty usb stick and then rename it to bios_img.rcvnow try the ctrl-esc recovery...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeere:  xps 8930 dell screen stuck at logo, dell screen black screen at startup with delayed boot sequence.the problem with any bios recovery with the xps 8930 is if the secure boot option somehow defaults to enable secure boot  and the monitor connected is to the gpu, you will continue to get the dell logo screen  hangup.the workaround  is to first to be able to get into the bios and second, to disable secure boot.before following the bios recovery option steps to reset the bios do the following:more info here:  https://www.dell.com/community/xps-desktops/xps-8930-black-screen-fix-motherboard-swap-bios-updates/... fwiw, i just successfully updated my xps 8930 to bios 1.1.27 using the f12 flash update option with the .exe file on a usb stick.

      "content: hi - i have an xps 8940, i7 11th gen 3.6ghz,64gb ram 4 x dell 16gb 2933mhz,rtx 3070, windows 10 proi believe it came with the higher watt psu.i have been getting unusual full hangs (where literally the screensaver or whatever is on screen stops moving, mouse inputs do nothing). these do not lead to bsods, but a forced (hold down power button for 7 or so seconds) reboot is necessary, then the 'repair my pc' or 'restart' option comes up at next boot, 'restart my pc' always comes back to normal logon and everything seems o k.this is obviously a complete pain. when i go through event viewers logs, i can't find anything except warnings about volume shadow copy not working, but these errors usually seem to be a good bit of time before the hang/crash. also, i don't even have backup switched on in windows settings. there are also some messages basically saying 'you have a hard disk which has the same guid as another hard disk', apparently the only fix for this is something which only exists for windows server, either way i can't see that error causing a massive system hang.i turned on full debugging etc., and intended to use win debug program to examine memory dumps, however, even though though the minidump folder is there, nothing gets put in there/written in there, so i have no logs to look at.i saw that a good few people were having weird hangs with rtxs which were caused by hardware acceleration in chrome/edge (and a few of the times the hang occurred, it was just as chrome started to stream a video (but unfortunately not all the time)). i turned off hardware acceleration in browser and the system did seem stable, however today, after not crashing for 5 days, the same hang has occurred.so i'm wondering if anyone has had similar issues with an 8940?could it be the psu - i know dell say it is enough, then again, would power issues come up in event viewer?i hope someone can help with this, as i'm at end of my wits now and considering buying a new motherboard, tower and psu and just bringing everything from my 8940 into it, though i really don't want to have to go down that route.thanks for any helpthe bios version can cause this.see this thread on the problem. later in the thread is procedure to roll back bios update.dell forum member since 2002dell inspiron 15  gaming 5577 laptophome built desktop pc with gigabyte designare z390,  i9 9900k cpuwindows 11 64 bit pro, 22h2, ssd drives. cakewalk by bandlab and studio one 4.6 pro recording studio software, motu ultralite mk5 recording interface unit.dell s2719dgf monitorthank you very much - i shall give that a try - excuse my ignorance - but is it possible to flash the bios from within windows - or do i have to put something on a usb stick and reboot etc.? - am i able to see which bios i am running from in windows?thanks@r4ytrace   - to check your current bios version, click start>run>type in: msinfo32.exe and click ok. when that opens, click system summary at top of left pane and scroll down right pane to see bios version/date. chances are you have v2.4.0 because windows update has been force-installing it on xps 8940 pcs.to downgrade to v2.3.0, you first have to enable the bios downgrade option in bios setup, (see table 9). you should download that v2.3.0 file onto an empty (non-bootable) 2-gb usb stick.  power xps 8940 fully off and then plug usb stick in.power on and start tapping f12 to open the boot menu. select the flash update option. select the bios 2.3.0 file on the usb stick.once you launch the update, do not power pc off, do not press any keys, etc. just leave pc alone until it's safely back at your desktop. it may reboot itself several times during the update process and may look like it has stopped doing anything for a short time. repeat: just leave pc alone until it's safely back at the desktop.when you're at the desktop, run msinfo32.exe again to confirm bios is v2.3.0. assuming you now have v2.3.0, reboot pc and tap f2 to open bios setup.find the option for uefi capsule updates (see table 4 in link, above), and disable it. that's supposed to prevent windows update from forcibly installing v2.4.0 again, but it might not...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeyes, you can do it from inside windows, assuming you've set the bios to allow a downgrade (and also turned of capsule updates).all you need do is go to the support page for driver downloads for your xps. look at the list, and on the bios you'll find listed the one you are on. however, if you open that up ( click on the 'v' on the right) you'll see \"view full driver details\" link at the bottom. click on that, and at the bottom of that page, you'll see this: i assume you are on v2.4.0, and you'd want to get v2.3.0.download the file in windows and execute it. it will open dell update and will start the install. you'll need to reboot to finish it. do not power off until it is completed and windows has opened again. during the reboot, the dell logo will appear and you see the install under it. i did this with no problem other than a minor 'fail' message about the intel me driver. seems if one is on a new bios, the older bios can't back level that driver. dell cares told me not to worry about that.a lot easier than using a flash drive i think?it  worked fine for me.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.thanks very much, i've noticed it seems to mainly happen when idling/screensaver is on - hopefully when i check i have the newer biosi don't think you want the latest bios, v2.4, but the one before, v2.3.at least a few of us have gone to v2.3 and have not had a freeze/lock-up occur. one reported over a 1 week of it not happening, and i'm on my 3rd day. we both have nvidia cards as well.i should note  that when bios v2.4 was installed, i did have long periods of it not happening though. but when it happens, it happens for days in a row and even more than once per day. usually when the monitor comes out of sleep but i've had it happen moving the mouse and closing active windows as well.open the reliability monitor, and you can see when it happened. the windows error of not shutting down properly is reported there.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.thanks - i meant as in hopefully i do currently have the newer bios (as then i have chance of fixing the issue) well, i just got a pm that they would like to exchange my 8940 as get it into engineering to examine it.not sure i want to do this? i figure i've got to 'sanitize' it so all my data is gone, and then what is the chance of them being able to recreate the problem if i can't do it on demand?i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.looking in dell update app - i do indeed have 2.40: \n",

configuration! the t1000 cost is about $300 that's a heck of a lot more than a $69 dp to hdmi (or dp to multi-dp) adapter, but i do appreciate knowing your setup. i have no clue if the optiplex 7090 is that same as an xps 8940. my xps 8940 does not have 3 dp ports on the motherboard, it only has one dp and on hdmi port. this tells me our systems are very different. what do you mean by the term \"igpu\"? is that the motherboard internal graphics unit?  view solution in original postyou didn't have to disable in the bios. that disabled the hd intel ports. you could leave it on, and want to

card before using an nvidia one.ispalten: thanks very much for your response here! i did not actually disable any bios settings for the motherboard graphics. i merely changed from \"auto\" to \"nvidia\" in an attempt to get the 730 card working. sorry if i confused the issue here...as an aside, i thought all the graphics on the motherboard were automatically disabled when a video adapter card was installed, thus the reason i thought i'd try making changes to the bios. that did nothing to get the gt-730 card to work in the x16 pcie port. also thanks for the tip on the nvidia boards. considering the cost of these boards (around $300), i'm thinking going with the dp to 3-port hdmi (or dp) would be the cheapest way to go and i eliminate another heat generator inside the box if i were to install a graphics card. again, my requirement is to power four vga / rgb  monitors at 1920 x 1080 / 60 hz. view solution in original postdp to hdmi splitter vendor small print:  the total

does not support three 3820x2160 @ 30 hz as that would take up 120% bandwidth, meaning it cannot support three 4k monitors.  two 4k is doable.the asus gt730 w 4xhdmi appears to be single slot width, as this pic shows it can be stacked.  if that is correct, can you try install in the lowest pcie x4 slot? redxps630: thanks for your input here! i did not try the nvidia gt-730 card in the x4 slot as i didn't want to have to remove (break out) the factory expansion slot covers from the chassis only to find out the gt-370 wouldn't work in that port either, so i returned the nvidia card thinking i'd rather employ an external dp to 3-port hdmi (or dp) adapter because there would be less heat generated if i did not use an expansion slot type graphics card. as far as the supported graphics is concerned, like you, i don't understand the fine print you've posted here but i do not have major requirements for very high end graphics like gamers might need for their video games. i use this system for doing database work so the requirement comes down to running four monitors which are all vga / rgb monitors at 1920x1080. 60 hz. i do realize i will need the appropriate hdmi (or dp) to vga adapters. i can get the dp to 3-port hdmi (or dp) for $69 and the adaptors to go to vga monitors for less than $90. much cheaper than the $300 video card many have installed in these systems. i thought the $89 gt-730 would be a cost-effective solution, but i couldn't fi it in the x1 pcei slot because dell put the ssd m2 card port way too close to the x1 port. view solution in original postthe asus gt730 will work.  i do not recommend the dp to 3x hdmi adapter.  it is less reliable and over costly.nb: the asus gt730 w 4xhdmi is not a fast video card.  it is pcie gen2 x1, hdmi 1.4b good for multi monitor display only.  hdmi 1.4b: 4k support for 4096×2160 at 24 hzyes, this gpu does have x1 pcie connector.the top x1 pcie slot you have on motherboard is going via chipset, not directly into cpu, therefore there will be adverse performance effect due to additional data transfer steps from cpu to pch to gpu via dmi 3.0 channel (but with this card it won't be constrained because of low requirements).you can also plug this card into blue x16 pcie slot for better results if it is compatible.the integrated gpu (igpu) uhd 750 coming with your 11th gen 11700 cpu is 50% to 100% (twice) better in accordance (and depending on) to benchmarks. but you can render (encode/decode) on one and display on another anyways as most professional applications do allow these settings.the display port to x3 hdmi adapter suitability depends on your requirements, single dp version 1.4 on that cpu can feed two 4k monitors (with total for a port of up to 5120 x 3200 at 60hz, which is close to 6k) via adapter, if you split it into 3 signals (multiscreen/extended) then resolution/frequency combination will be much lower than 4k. your amazon link is preselected on dp v1.2 but there's v1.4 too for the same price (but with dp on another end, hence you'll need another set of adapters or cables for getting into hdmi).you will also have to ensure what high-quality dp cable supporting 1.4 standard is used at least between xps 8940 and adapter (to accommodate sufficient data bandwidth).as a cheap option to have more outputs this might work but depending on a budget and graphics performance goals for better results it might be more advantageous to get a better card (e.g. nvidia 16xx , 20xx or 30xx generation, or quadro txxx/axxx series).on my dell i7-11700 pc with multiple 4k monitors i'm using both: integrated gpu and the quadro plugged into pcie slot (with x4 display ports), so you probably don't necessarily have to get card with x4 ports but can get additional with less ports and use outputs from both cards to get your total to x4 at high resolutions.i do agree with @redxps630  as these active dp convertors/adapters into 3 ports are too expensive relatively to just getting additional card (but is a good solution if you're out of pcie slots or there's no space left inside pc even for a reasonable air exchange).there is another 4xhdmi discrete video card option: asus gt710-sl-2gd5-csm graphics card asus geforce gt 710 fanless gddr5 2gb graphics card, 4x hdmi the asus geforce gt 710 is a passively-cooled single-slot graphics card that enables silent multi-monitor productivity.please note, this graphics card has a maximum resolution of 3840 x 2160 @60hz if just one monitor is connected. if you plan to use more than one monitor then the maximum resolution changes to 3840 x 2160 @30hz for all connected monitors.if there video cards with \"acceptable\" performance at reasonable price with 3 hdmi outputs, you could consider a usb3>hdmi dongle for 4th monitor...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeunfortunately, when i attempted to install this  asus gt-730 card in the pcie x1 slot, it would not fit because the heat sink i installed on the 4tb ssd m.2 2230/2280 slot encroached into the area where the x1 port resides on the motherboard and the gt-730 card would not clear the ssd heat sink. i then tried to install gt-370 in the pceie x16, slot but that didn't work - only one hdmi port worked for some reason. i did attempt to change the bios from automatic to nvida for the graphics but that didn't help. installing this card also eliminated the motherboard graphics (disabled the display port (dp) as well as the hdmi on the motherboard). the asus gt730 will work.  i do not recommend the dp to 3x hdmi adapter.  it is less reliable and over costly.nb: the asus gt730 w 4xhdmi is not a fast video card.  it is pcie gen2 x1, hdmi 1.4b good for multi monitor display only.  hdmi 1.4b: 4k support for 4096×2160 at 24 hzthe dp to 3-hdmi is $69. not sure i understand how this would be \"over costly\" especially when comparing to a graphics card cost? reliability would be a concern but i'd like to know why the dp to hdmi would not be reliable? sam55todd: thanks for the find on the dp v1.4 to 3-port dp adapter. my monitors are all vga so i will be using adapters from whatever i decide to use as a multi monitor graphics solution. however, i see you are using using both integrated gpu and the quadro plugged into pcie slot (with x4 display ports). i'm thinking that would be a better way to go but i thought adding a graphics adapter card disables the internal graphics. what is the specific model of the quatro board you have? also how did you configure bios to use both internal and expansion graphics card? my display requirement is 4 displays 1920x1080 60hzthanks, unfortunately i can't use a card in the pcie x1 slot due to the heat sync on the ssd card getting in the way. thanks ron, i'll consider this as well!\n",

      "content: okay for the dell data vault collector services i decided to change those services to a manual start up from where they were set to as automatic start to help reduce the load on my only 16 gb of memory. so far no errors and will i be okay to have done that.? also there is a large data base file which shows in my defragment program often as having too many fragments and it is about 4 gb. so is that created from the data vault services and may be okay to delete it? it is this file type like this, ( .db ) which is a data base file.@james2b you can just delete the program. i have and feel that it provides no useful benefit. see this: https://www.minitool.com/news/dell-data-vault.html the dell data vault runs only as several services and has no program listed to uninstall. also since my xps is the 8500 model from 11-2012 and still running with the original hard drive, being over 10 years old, how much longer until it fails.?if you have no dell data vault program to uninstall you could go to computer management / services and applications / services and find the services you wish to stop, right-click on the service, choose properties, and change the startup type to manual or disable.okay yes i did do that and there are 3 related data vault services which changed from automatic start up to a manual start. then i have checked in the task manager after booting and they do not run. thanks.@james2b i am happy this solution worked out for you. if you are satisfied with the solution you should click 'accept as solution' to help others with the same problem. \n",

      "content: i am experiencing a high cpu temperature with low cpu usage rate, like 80 degree in 10% usage. i did some research and be told to disable the avx512 function. however i could not find where to disable it at bios setting page on motherboard 427jk. can anyone give me some advice please?i'm not sure how to do it on xps bios level (perhaps some xtu tweaks) but 11700 has only two avx512 execution units, so this feature is not all-core and if you see workload running hot on all cores then it's not avx512's fault but rather some other process gloating especially considering what avx512 instruction set is still hardly being called by any mainstream applications these days (but might got a bit more popular in coding over recent couple of years, e.g. sql server 2022 has significant performance improvements on vectorized calculations with avx-512 from much broader cache/buffer bandwidth vs avx2 but it is indeed comes with extra power consumption consequences which are inevitably converted into extra thermal dissipation requirements), avx512 is rather specialized programming (with primary market for server-based cpus) and introducing avx512 into application code requires an additional effort (which is not cheap) - therefore won't be added just for fun as it costs extra dev time and money (although software development frameworks/libs might do it for you).i would check for cpu-resource hungry processes first (e.g. worst-case scenario - there's some weird crypto-mining worm-script running on a background without user consent, e.g. via some some predatory webpages/games).xps 8940 isn't thermally-optimal in base model on a first place and it also depends what cooling solution you have (e.g. with stock cooler, whether cpu was upgraded later {worse - without vr heatsink}) and if operating system is optimal (version, bugs/updates, etc.). if it is windows \"system idle process\" then i would say what the problem has nothing to do with avx512.alternatively you can check frequency of your cpu in task manager (for windows systems) and if it's above base level then disable turboboost or reduce cpu frequency via windows power plan settings (e.g. setting \"processor power management\" \"minimum processor state\" to say 99%). not sure if hyperthreading should be modified as i don't expect this to have much of an effect in this case.@nickhuang  - sure all fans are working correctly? reboot and tap f12 when you see the dell splash screen to open the menu. select option to run diagnostics and when that opens, run the fan tests, assuming they're offered.do you have the intel dynamic tuning driver installed? \"... a power and thermal management solution that is used to resolve fan noise, overheating, and performance-related issues of the system.\"  ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employee\n",

add to this post in case there is anyone else who, like me, wishes to give their xps 8900 a mid-life upgrade by fitting an ssd system disk.  i used a samsung 970 evo 500gb nvme pcie ssd.  the xps 8900 motherboard will boot from an nvme pcie ssd, but i recommend updating to the latest uefi bios first (2.4.0).  the 8900 m.2 nvme motherboard slot is only pcie x1, and so it is essential to use a pcie add-in card for the new ssd in order to benefit from the full pcie x4 speed.i wanted to keep the existing 2gb hdd for data, and so did not wish to disturb its ssd cache acceleration (32gb ssd set up as raid 0 with the hdd in intel rst).  i therefore left raid on in the bios, as an ssd is plug-and-play with raid on using the native windows 10 intel rst driver.  the only downside is that you cannot use samsung’s driver or magician ssd management software (both require the bios to be set to achi), but in my view this is not a significant issue unless you are a demon gamer and wish to wring out every last drop of performance.the procedure i used was as follows, derived from a number of different sources: 1. backup the system in every way!    - create & test a new macrium reflect rescue cd    - ensure you have a windows 10 recovery usb drive    - defrag the hdd2. fit the ssd card in a pcie slot:    - samsung 970 evo 500gb nvme pcie ssd on lycom dt-120 add-in card    - use slot 23 (or 24) on illustration in dell service manual (both are actually wired x4)    - depending upon clearance from graphics card fan (24 is tight on my machine)    - (n.b. these slots are labelled 14 & 15 on the illustration posted above)3. clone hdd to ssd using macrium reflect:    - macrium reflect > “run as administrator”    - n.b. disable antivirus & online backup first!    - also disconnect from network & set power to “high performance”    - adjust os (c: ) partition size, but keep partitions in the same order    - (the contents of my hdd comfortably fitted onto the ssd, making this straightforward)    - after cloning put a text file on the desktop of the hdd that says “this is the old hdd”4. set bios (tap f2 just before dell splash screen):    - to make ssd the boot drive c: (the boot drive is automatically assigned c: )    > settings > general > boot sequence    > set ssd as 1st boot device (i.e. above “windows boot manager”)5. check system is booting from ssd:    - desktop text message from 3 above (“this is the old hdd”) will not be there!    - size of c: drive should be size of ssd    - as shown in file explorer, disk management (right-click start), and macrium reflect6. run for a while to ensure all is well:    - check trim is turned on for ssd    - also turn on system restore for ssd7. format the hdd when you are sure the ssd is ok:    - use diskpart from command prompt to clean hdd & remove efi boot partition    > use disk management (right-click start) to re-initialise, format & name hdd d: as “data”    - this will result in failure to

less than full specs with it.those who added a m.2 to pcie adapter to the x16 or x4 pcie slots got full nvme specs, like xyspade, since they're pcie 3.0 and x4 lanes which a nvme m.2 ssd needs for full speed.those who connected a nvme ssd to the 8900's built-in m.2 slot - which although pcie 3.0, turns out only has a x1 lane and not x4 - got reduced performance.  here's a post/thread with that realization back in 2015 - thread ends with users getting full performance via add-in pcie adapter card.  here's another post in july of this year mentioning a chat with dell confirming this as well.so, to use samsung as a specific example, if you want a samsung 970 evo/pro nvme ssd at it's rated performance (up to 3500 mbps or so) you'll need a m.2 to pcie x4 adapter like xyspade bought (lots of choices available - i use this one, also available here, plus this heatsink in another machine).  the adapter goes into either the x16 pcie slot labeled #14 or the x4 pcie slot labeled #15 in the diagram below.  both #14 and #15 slots are electrically hooked up for x4 lanes and pcie 3.0 and will give you full nvme m.2 ssd performance. there's a good (and readably short) thread on the pcie slot capabilities of the xps 8900 here on dell's forums with dell going over how many lanes are actually hooked up to each.if, on the other hand, you think full sata iii ssd performance (up to 550 mbps) is sufficient, you can either add a 2.5\" sata ssd like the samsung 860 evo/pro in one of the 3.5\" drive bays, or you could get a samsung 860 evo/pro in m.2 format and add it to the 8900's native m.2 ssd slot (the slot labeled #9 in the diagram above).  you'll get full sata iii performance either way.but, if you buy a samsung 970 evo/pro and put it in the 8900's native m.2 sdd slot (labeled #9 in the above diagram) you'll only get about 800 mbps.be aware, that the small file 4k performance of all the above ssds are about the same.  because of this for many real-world situations actual performance of all of them may not be much difference.nvme pcie ssd upgrade for dell xps 8900 i thought i would add to this post in case there is anyone else who, like me, wishes to give their

XPS-8900 is UEFI based, so booting of NVMe SSDs from a PCIe Addin Card should work.You can always return the SSD to Amazon, but don't \"give-up\" to quick.https://www.dell.com/community/XPS-Desktops/XPS-8930-970-Evo-SSD-RAM-upgrade-instructions/td-p/62069...  \n",

i appreciate no one can give any more firmer reassurances unless they have tried it .i'll leave this thread as unsolved for the moment so as not to discourage other comments, at least until i take my leap of faith next week and report back here.many thanksalan.afaik, there are no limitations on size of the ssd in bios or in windows. and i doubt the intel chipset drivers have any such limits either.maybe you might just start with the 4t sata ssd upgrade and hold off on the nvme ssd for a while. the xps 8950 is quite new and others may not have had time to do mods like you're proposing...before you install any new drives, you probably will want to change bios from raid to ahci, because some ssds don't like raid. but, you have to do it the right way, or you'll make the pc unbootable.now you're ready for upgrades. and as always, it's your pc, your £ £, and your decisions...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeemany thanks for the advice and the ahci change is a top tip... i would probably missed this in my excitement!    unfortunately unless i also buy another 4tb sata ssd as well as the nvme i will need to take the nvme plunge straight away.   i need to keep my old pc a perfectly viable system so i can cross check my migration of my music production system (cubase) and purchased vsts. photography (lightroom, on1 etc) and video and other production software.   the migration task is massive which is why i held off 8 years!thanks for the advice.alan   you know what you need better than anybody...and it's only a few extra bob for a 4t nvme ssd...ok, it's a lot more than a few..!post back and let us know how the upgrade goes.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeefor the purpose of closure ,,,   after the ahci change as advised by rohe ... top tip!i have installed a seagate firecuda 530, 4 tb, internal solid state drive -

      "content: my 8950 xps win 10 odd (optical disk drive) does not perform as it should. it has been replaced twice under dell's warranty so i don't believe the drive itself is the problem. the performance is erratic. it can take a long time before explorer recognizes there is a disc in the drive initially and then it can read a new disc quickly. dell support says everything is operating properly but it is not. my other computers read the optical drive almost instantly, but this dell machine has a problem. one other issue is that autoplay on the optical drive does not work. autoplay works fine elsewhere.if the drive has been replace twice already without much of a change, have you considered replacing the sata data cable?i don't think it is the drive. i replaced mine with a bluray drive and yeah, it takes a bit sometimes. i put the old drive in my inspiron 3650 and it works fine. i never thought about a possible cable issue.i've found that those slim-tray drives are fragile and only for low-volume use.i used to burn/rip a bunch of discs (cd, dvd, bd) back in the day. i found it is better to use a real name-brand 5.25-inch burner (like a lg with burn-proof and m-disc ) . since modern desktops are smaller (and optical tech is being depreciated) , i like to now install in a nice external usb-3.0 enclosure like an owc mercury pro. i have that setup on my desk right now and it works fine (i have my old lg blu-ray burner  drive installed in it).actually, if you just want to burn/rip cds and dvds (no bluray-discs) ... i saw an external-usb lg burner ready to plugin and go. owc has mercury pro with or without a drive installed (and affordably priced).no one has suggested replacing the cable until now. what could have gone wrong with the cable?the external optical drives are all like the same flimsy drive i have now.the external optical drives are all like the same flimsy drive i have now.no.what country are you in?do you just want a dvd burner, or one that also burns/rips blu-rays also?can you afford $150 for a nice 5.25-inch external optical drive that will work for this system and any others for about 10 years? i live in canada. so what do you recommend? i discovered today that when this optical drive refuses to respond i can go into device manager and select it and then it wakes up. i have an xps 8950 also. i noticed my dvd optical drive gets a little wacky sometimes. autoplay did not work for the optical drive. i found that dell cyberlink suite of apps on my machine was the default software for the optical drive. when the cyberlink software was uninstalled, the optical drive behaved as i expected. this may or may not help your situation, but i thought i would mention it.interesting. i don't have dell cyberlink suite on my machine. the drivers for my optical drive are all windows. \n",

      "content:  hello everyone:i have an xps-8930 se and was about to install that bad 1.1.27 bios downloaded three days ago, when i was cruising by and read the horror stories from many forum members. it is now deleted from my system and i see that it is not being offered to me again via a dell technical bulletin by email or by dell's support assist.this leads me to an important question.if the bios is not operational, how can the system be restored?another member said that the motherboard had to be replaced.there must be a better way, no? this is really scary.thanks for your time and happy holidays.  dell bios validation process - flip a coin; heads release it now . . . tails release it in 3 days@brainiac  you can use dell's bios recovery to recover from a bad bios update. quite a few users did exactly that to revert their xps 8930 systems from 1.1.27 back to 1.1.26 and restore full function.it's not clear what happened after 1.1.27 got installed. stalling at the dell splash with solid white pc power button would indicate the pc passed the power on self-test (post) and bios handed over control to windows. that suggests -to me- a setting in this new version is incorrect for the way windows is installed, so windows essentially freezes.even with thorough validation, bios updates can only be tested based on a system without any addition/replacement of factory hardware, and/or bios and windows settings changes. dell may use equivalent hardware from different manufacturers (eg, ssd, ram, gpu, etc) and even a new generation intel cpu. so it's impossible to test all the factory combinations. on top of that, users add and/or replace factory hardware, change bios and windows settings in different ways all the time. so there's never a guarantee a bios update will work on every system, even if it works in dell's tests.fwiw, bios 1.1.27 installed on my xps 8930 without any issues at all. not clear what's different about my pc which boots and runs fine with bios 1.1.27 installed.  obviously, that doesn't guarantee i'll be so lucky with the next bios update...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employee@rohehow would you be able to reach the bios if it is wiped or bricked, as it is called?the dell bios recovery procedure is quite flawed in this respect.how do they re-flash the bios at the factory?thanks.p.s. how do i enable single line forum spacing by default?  you don't have to \"reach\" bios.you can start the process on any pc. go to the support page for your pc model (eg xps 8930) and on the drivers/download tab select system firmware from the options.  expand the entry for the current bios version, and click \"older versions\". click the link for the version before the one that failed to install. so, in this example, if bios 1.1.26 failed to install, you'd select version 1.1.24. (safer to go back one version, in case the latest version has problems.)when that page opens, look for the link to download the bios recovery image file (.rcv). download the file onto an empty fat32-formatted usb stick.  do not change the name of the .rcv file on the usb.when that's done, plug the usb into xps 8930 will power fully off. power on and immediately press ctrl and esc at same time and hold both keys down until the keyboard backlight comes on, or if no backlight, until the cap light comes on. then release ctrl and esc and just follow the prompts when the recovery window opens...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employee@brainiac with respect, did you even check out the bios recovery link that @rohe provided in his reply?@rohe even provided a direct download link for the bis recovery image file that was necessary when the bios version 1.1.27 borked some computers, including mine.  thanks to his expertise, i was able to roll back to bios version 1.1.26 successfully in one of the topics to which he responded.experts here, and @rohe is one of the foremost, if not the foremost, dedicate countless hours and share their knowledge to freely help other dell users.  he receives no compensation from dell.personally, i applaud his dedication.  i don't know how you concluded that the dell \"bios recovery  procedure is quite flawed in this respect.\"  as @rohe replied, it has worked quite well for those of us who followed the instructions exactly.working voluntarily as i do at bleeping computer helping users with their real or imagined malware issues, i have too often seen my efforts go unappreciated.  that is very discouraging for volunteers.this forum is so fortunate to have an expert of @rohe 's obvious in-depth knowledge of dell computers and his willingness to spend so many hours assisting other users.just my two cents.  have a great day; and, please read his link.regards,philps: you can \"tell\" the forum editor to use single-line spacing by holding down the shift key when you press \"enter\" for the following paragraph. @garioch7i am not questioning anyone's competency here. everyone's dedication is quite appreciated.what is totally confusing to me, is the ability to boot from this usb recovery without a working bios.i did look at the procedure in-depth and it mentions nothing about a totally nuked bios.how would this usb recovery device be detected in the first place.if this could be clarified for me, i would be most appreciative.additionally, thanks for the single spacing tip!brainiac. that's how the recovery is designed.the recovery instructions may be permanently programmed into a separate area of the cmos chip that can't be changed by doing a flash update. so as long as the cmos chip isn't damaged, that area should still work even though corrupted bios instructions may be stored in the programmable area.   you really don't need to know/worry about the geeky details. just look how many users were able to do the recovery from bios 1.1.27 and fully restore their pc to a  working state.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employee@rohe-interesting point for a true geek like me.i will investigate this further. one can also argue that if the cmos battery is removed, that capability, if it exists would be gone. then again, if that code is in a different bootstrap type of chip, it would be novel.the dell motherboard is proprietary, so i don't have enough information at my disposal.if anyone knows the answer, please chime in!again, happy holidays and thanks for your kind input.\n",

      "content:  greetings to all: i, too, had my xps-8930 system \"bricked\" by this nasty bios update.so, after having dell replace my  motherboard and coming back to 1.1.26, what's next?perhaps a way to re-install the bios via a usb method, if the bios is \"bricked\" again?the next revision deserves serious thought. it can *never* happen again. comments welcome.    leave it alone until dell releases a new bios update. that could take a while until they find and fix whatever went wrong with 1.1.27.  make sure uefi capsule updates is disabled in bios setup so windows update can't install a new version without permission.and never say \"never\". bios updates can only be tested under factory specs.  dell can use equivalent hardware (eg, ssd, ram, gpu, etc) from different manufacturers and even different generation intel cpus (8th and 9th gen cpus were installed in xps 8930 at different times). so that alone makes it impossible to test every possible combination.on top of that, users add and replace hardware, change bios and windows setting all the time. so a bios that works during testing may not work on every xps 8930.fwiw, my xps 8930 installed and runs fine with bios 1.1.27 (updated from 1.1.26 via the f12 menu). no telling what's so different about my pc. aside from updating to win 10 22h2, it's entirely factory spec.and there's no guarantee i'll be so lucky when the next bios update is released....ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeanonymouswhat @rohe advised is the correct course of action.  wait until dell support releases a new bios update, wait a week, then check the desktop xps forum.  if no one is reporting issues, then use the bios flash method to update to version 1.1.28 or whatever it is called.  that is what i intend to do.you asked for comments.  this is my comment.i agree with you, this should never happen again.  dell qa has to be improved, but as @rohe has pointed out, no computer hardware or software vendor can effectively test for all computer configurations.that said, dell could have done better by pulling that bios update as soon as they realized it was borking computers, instead of waiting several days.have a great day.regards,-philwhen 1.1.27 was still posted, this remediation addressed three cve-2022 identifiers (id's). i didn't take the time to make note of what those cve id's we're. however, i am 100% certain there were three cve's addressed by this update version dell's security and advisories page found here:https://www.dell.com/support/security/en-us/has a published list of dell security advisories (dsa) that address the common vulnerabilities and exposures and the filters found on the left pane can narrow the search.by using the xps 8930 filter, a search returned only four, but only one cve-2022 id addressed the remediation for cve-2022-34398 as bios 1.1.27 under dsa-2022-339. after searching through the first 10 pages without using filters i could not find the other two cve's that the support page mentioned for bios 1.1.27 you asked for shared comments, so i'm going to express my comment in an allegorical way. dirty harry callahan, aka ( clint dellwood) thinking he just foiled a common vulnerability and exposure with cold-blooded marksmanship, instead killed multiple innocent bystanders. harry approaches one of the wounded bystanders who is lying on the sidewalk, his broken cmos chip within arm's reach. he sees the man's hand reaching for the motherboard-- but clint dellwood has him dead to rights. that is, if his 1.1.27 magnum has a bullet left in it.so dirty harry begins a discourse with the bystander lying on the sidewalk :\"uh uh. i know what you're thinking. \"did he fire six shots or only five?\" well to tell you the truth in all this excitement i kinda lost track myself. but being this is a bios 1.1.27 magnum, the most powerful update in the world and would blow your motherboard clean off, you've gotta ask yourself one question: \"do i feel lucky?\" well, do ya, punk?\"         the thing with parodies nowadays, you can't make fun of anything .  . anymore  \n",

      "content: the dell premium support plus warranty coverage on my xps8930 is expiring in december, when the email warning of pending end of coverage was received and i contacted dell regarding a warranty extension, i was informed that because the system will be 4 years old as of january 2022, that no further dell premium support plus warranty coverage was applicable and the only warranty coverage that could be extended was \"software support\" only.the initial quoted price for software support only coverage was $239 cdn + tax (1 year) which was the exact same price that was paid a year previous for the premium support plus coverage (1 year) this seemed somewhat exorbitant in light of this being the price that was paid last year for premium support plus coverage, with only software support being offered.the software support only coverage offer was declined when the pricing was pointed out to dell, at which point dell re-quoted the software support only coverage at $199 cdn + tax (1 year) with subsequent yearly software support only renewal coverage being offered thereafter at $140 cdn + tax (1 year)the reason behind opening this thread is not so much in questioning dell's warranty pricing matrix, and limiting the available warranty coverage for a system approaching 4 years in age is understandable, but i would be interested in knowing if any other users have any experience with dell's software support only warranty coverage and it's viability and usefulness. i should also point out at this time, that i did not have any reason to utilize the dell premium support plus warranty coverage during the last year as any issues encountered were able to be resolved using internet resources and the dell community forum.apologizes if this thread should have been opened possibly in the customer care forum, but i have only ever posted/responded to topics in the xps desktop forum, mostly for assistance when preforming some modifications to the xps8930.any insights or thoughts on dell's software support only warranty coverage would be most appreciated. thanksthank you! we have received the required details. we will work towards a resolution. in the meantime, you may also receive assistance or suggestions from the community members.#iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".the exact same thing happened to me.  when i had premium support, i liked using dell update & support assist programs, never needed anything else.  when this agreement ran out, i was advised that i needed to purchase the annual software agreement to run these, which i did.  well so far i still don't know what is actually included in in the agreement for support (not even described on dell's support page) and neither program runs or can be reinstalled.  it seems no one can answer these or help me.  my wife has a dell computer long out of support and both programs still work.  if the software agreement isn't necessary to run the programs, then i want to cancel it and get a full refund.hi.i would like a hardware extension for my xps-8930 for one more year, past the four years already paid for. naturally, i would pay for it if the fee was reasonable.why can't dell offer me this option?\n",

      "content: hi gurus,my dell xps 8930 desktop does not boot after bios ( ver 1.1.27 dated dec 12, 2022) update attempt yesterday. bios update was triggered by dell technical notification email for my computer. i did not get any error message during the update but computer never rebooted. when i turn on the computer it gets stuck at the dell logo screen, power button led also sometimes blinks 5 times.i tested the cmos battery with multimeter it is showing 3v, so that’s not the issue. i also shortened the cmos jumpers, just in case but no luck. i also tried the control & esc procedure, still no luck. when i press cntrl/esc during boot, i see the blue progress bar at bottom of screen and also “f2/f12” options but if i press f2 or f12  during boot, it does not take me to bios screen. any chance of revival at this stage?otherwise, my options now, as i see them, are either to buy a new computer, or replace the motherboard. i would prefer to reuse the intel(r) core(tm) i7-8700k cpu @ 3.70ghz, m.2nvme 500gb storage, 16 gb of memory, etc in new motherboard.i am debating should i get exactly same motherboard (dell price quote $230) or get something different, not sure which motherboards will fit in the case and utilize the components also.  any suggestions / guidance will be highly appreciated.different mother board will get rid of maxx audio pro, a plus point.thanks for your time and happy holidays.solved!go to solution.don't forget to disable uefi capsule updates in setup for bios 1.1.26 asap so windows update doesn't reinstall 1.1.27.at this point, the easiest thing would be to re-image the ssd. caveat: any personal files created and stored on the nvme ssd after you made that  image will be lost. that could include recent emails etc. etc. so you have to make that decision. depending on how old the image is, you may have a bunch of windows and other updates to install.the thing you need to know is if bios was set to raid or ahci when you made the image, and make sure it's set the same way before re-imaging the drive. but, if it's not set correctly the first time you try, you could just change the setting to the other option and re-image the ssd again.if do you decide to make a clean os install, with the caveats about personal files and updates mentioned above, as long as bios is set to ahci before you launch the windows installer, it will configure the os for ahci and install the right drivers automatically.what a mess they made of this... <sigh>ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeview solution in original postmultiple threads on this topic already, so search for them.some users removed the nvme ssd which allows them to downgrade bios back to 1.1.26. then they reinstalled the ssd and it's good to go.dell has been made aware...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeetry remove nvme ssd, and then if able to post, downgrade bios to 1.1.26 as this was the fix reported by some users.thanks. i will give it a try today.hi,i was able to turn the secure boot off after removing nvme and gpu. but was unable to recover the bios with 8gb fat32 usb. only file on it was  bios ver 1.1.26 img.rcv file. i followed the “cntrl&esc” routine, but system did not give me the option to recover bios!! should the .exe file also be there??also, please take a look at bios pics and let me if anything else need to change.thanks. what is tpm?secure boot disabledthe .exe file is only to install bios, not to do a ctrl-esc to recover it.i don't think having secure boot enabled has anything to do with this problem. i have secure boot enabled and legacy disabled on my xps 8930 and bios got updated to 1.1.27 via the f12 menu without problems.did you ever reconfigure both sata operation in bios and windows to use ahci instead of raid?  your screen shows ahci is enabled, but if you never reconfigured windows for ahci, it probably/likely won't boot.if you're game, change that setting to raid and save the change and exit setup. power off and reinstall the nvme ssd. if you use ethernet cable to router, unplug it or if you use wifi, turn the router off. then power pc on and see if it boots now. if not, remove the ssd again. plug in a usb with only the bios 1.1.26 .exe file on it. power on and tap f12 to open the menu. see if you can run the flash update to install bios 1.1.26 again (with ethernet unplugged or router off).now reinstall the ssd. as soon as it starts to boot tap f2 to open bios setup. immediately disable uefi capsule updates because you don't want windows update to install 1.1.27 again. and i'd also enable bios auto-recovery and always perform integrity check. keep in mind that these settings all revert to their defaults after every bios update, so you will have to change those settings, especially capsule updates, immediately after updating bios. secure boot should be set to always, except internal hdd.tpm (trusted protection module) is a chip on the motherboard that's used for encryption keys when the drive(s) is encrypted, eg using encryption services like bitlocker, windows hello, etc. don't change that setting and don't enable ppi. if your drive(s) is encrypted, disabling or clearing tpm will remove the encryption keys and you'll lose everything on the drive(s).post back and let us know what happens, especially if changing bios to raid restores the boot...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeehi rohe,thanks for the detailed response.i remember computer had raid but due to some reason i changed it in bios, cant remember why. i probably did not make any associated changes in windows.today, i changed the sata operation to raid and saved it, powered off and reinstalled nvme ssd, second hard disk and gpu, and also shut off the router. computer boots now, but screens while booting looks different. i reached the login screen, pin was accepted, after that screen goes blank and stays blank.maybe reconfiguring bios to raid is causing some conflict? nvme ssd has only the operating system, win 10 only, not sure if formatting it and making changes for raid in windows will solve the issue.i see that bios got updated to 1.1.27. not sure, if i should attempt to rollback to 1.1.26.i have attached pictures of bios after the changes and questions that i have are also noted there.please advise.i appreciate your time guiding me.thanks, a wee bit of progress! posting screen shots has been really helpful, so well-done!pity you didn't post a screen shot of bios setup main screen right after you removed the ssd. do you remember if that screen listed bios 1.1.27 or 1.1.26 after you removed the ssd?i'm more suspicious now that the update might have actually got installed but something in the post goes amuck in the boot up when bios is set to ahci or has some other incorrect setting. if you didn't install the ahci drivers, it's probably not surprising windows can't load and hangs at the splash screen.do you have a dell oem gpu or do you have an \"after-market\" gpu that you bought/installed? if you have an after-market gpu, secure boot has to be disabled to allow the pc to boot. when secure boot is disabled, as in latest screen shot, that automatically disables tpm. and you can't enable secure boot when legacy rom options is enabled, as it is now. so regardless of whether you have an oem gpu or an after-market gpu, you can leave secure boot disabled, at least for now.after you reinstalled the gpu, did you connect your monitor to that card or are you using one of the onboard intel graphics (hdmi or dp) ports? when an add-in gpu is installed, the first monitor has to be connected directly to that add-in card, not to an onboard intel port. so confirm where the monitor is connected now.if it is  connected to the card, you might try removing it completely from the pc and connecting the monitor to one of the onboard video ports to see if the pc will get to desktop without blanking the screen, which could rule the card in or out of the current problem.and if that doesn't help you could try putting bios back to ahci again...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeeand one more thingy... plug a bootable usb into the pc with power fully off. you can use the microsoft media creation tool to create a bootable usb for win 10.with usb plugged in, power the pc on and tap f12 to open that menu. select option to boot from usb. if that works without screen going blank, then it's possible there's something wrong with windows on the ssd. in this case use the troubleshooting  and startup repair options on the usb to see if they can fix things...ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeehi rohe,nvidia ms v351 ver 1 gpu came with computer, primary monitor was attached to the gpu.today, created the bootable usb for win 10 and tried the repair but was not successful. log files are shared in link below.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-1luujas5iayfv8izjrddw0kfat74ihn?usp=sharingbootfailure.txtdisklayout.txtsrttrail.logsrttrail.txtbcdinfo.txt on the plus side, i was successful in rollback of driver to version 1.1.26 from within the bios itself via bios flash option. after that i changed the sata operation to ahci but the same results after login as before. now i am thinking there is something wrong with the operating system on ssd nvme. bcdinfo.txt file indicates “the boot configuration data store could not be opened. the volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid.” dont know if relelvant in this case.next, i am thinking of re-imaging the partition form backup image or may be do a clean install from the windows 10 media usb that i created today, more work but i will have a clean operating system. how do i install ahci drivers or windows media usb will take care of it based on info in bios.  bios sata operation is in ahci mode currently.if you would like to try something different, let me know. once again thank you for the valuable guidance and time. \n",

      "content: users often report windows update automatically update pc bios without user input/control/consent.  this can be disabled in bios if there is an option for uefi capsule firmware update.  for example, xps8940, 8950 or optiplex 7050, 7080 or inspiron 3910 or aurora r13default: enabledi do not see this option in alienware aurora r10, r12.@redxps630 i believe it has been reported in this forum that turning off uefi capsule firmware updates does not always prevent bios updates via windows update. i don't know if the problem has been fixed. here is an example: https://www.dell.com/community/xps-desktops/xps-8930-disabling-uefi-firmware-capsule-updates-didn-t-... also reportedly a bios update will reset some bios settings including the capsule update setting.  so if you do it, check afterwards, and reset to your preferences.thank you for pointing this out. looks like the dell bios capsule switch is overruled in those instances.yet another dell suggestion here (win 10/11 pro)your computer will continue to receive security and other patches after completing these steps, but drivers will be excluded. one of the problems is the different naming conventions between the bios if you install it and when windows update does. windows update has a '0.' in front of the version number...i've had wu install bios 0.2.7.0 over v2.7.0 i manually installed.. saw that in the reliability viewer one time.i also think that there is a bit in the header that wu reads... as i've seen it also sitting as an optional update so i have to select it, but other times it comes in automatically. if this is the case, then whoever builds the delivery file either did it wrong, or dell wanted to be sure 'everyone' got the update.bottom line, for whatever the reason is, that setting can not guarantee it will not happen it seems.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.i'm another of those who had a bios update forcibly installed on a pc via windows update, even with uefi capsule updates disabled in bios.bios 0.1.1.18 for xps 8930 was offered as an \"optional\" update by windows update for a couple of weeks and then it disappeared from that screen and was force-installed on top of the existing bios bios 1.1.18, and listed as \"successful\" in the wu update history.. forced bios updates haven't happened since bios 0.1.1.18.  i was offered bios 0.1.1.22 and currently being offered 0.1.1.23, both as \"optional\" updates via windows update. i already installed 1.1.23 so i've ignored the wu offer. and -so far- it hasn't force-installed it. so perhaps, maybe, possibly they fixed wu so \"optional\" bios updates aren't force-installed, regardless of the uefi capsule update setting. but i am keeping an eye on it.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeethis is helpful advice from dell. but it's all or nothing - i'd like an option to not include a bios update and allow all other driver updates to be inlcuded in windows updates.is there a way?it might help some people (including me) with the consequences of a bios auto-update by windows update on xps 8930 desktops to prevent it in the future.@luke717,there is no 'official' dell response here.i did 'locate' by accident another windows settings. i don't know how this works with the capsule update? you can reach it by opening your settings, system, about and click any related links on the top device specifications, and then the hardware tab. you can also get to it this way. press the windows key + r together to bring up the run box, type sysdm. cpl and press enter to open the system properties window. switch to the hardware tab,next click on device installation settings:it is not clear to me if this does anything or not, or who is in control, the bios or the os? does one overrule the other? me, i think the bios would be the controller, but would that stop the os from doing it? i'm thinking this would be the limiter for support assist, but i'm not sure about that either? i've not disabled it though.i've searched the web for more info on this too... and can not find a definitive answer, however there are other ways to change this setting, this link, https://pureinfotech.com/stop-windows-10-installing-drivers-automatically/ has all the ways to reach that setting, registry, group policy editor, and the control panel.on reading that link (and others) it still isn't clear what it controls? sort of implies files in windows updates optional category. that is where i found a bios update by the way that did after a few days did get installed. i have windows home and no group policy editor, so i can stop it or allow it via a device list. one thing i noticed, the naming convention on windows update bios files. normally dell names them. x.exe, where x is the version number. however in windows update it is called 0.x.exe. mismatched names could play into this, as windows update wouldn't see that file by name on a driver and assume it is new and install it?i've googled \"windows setting device installation settings\" and i can't locate a true definition of how it works compared to windows update?this one link, https://www.groovypost.com/howto/disable-automatic-driver-installation-on-windows-11/ sort of is typical of the info i've found. for instance:===========================whether you use the windows 11 interface or go through group policy, you’ll no longer receive any device driver automatically through windows update when you’ve completed the steps. instead, you’ll need to install them manually.===================not at all clear?reading that though sort of implies one wouldn't need the capsule update setting at all?one thing is clear to me, capsule update did not prevent at least one windows update of the bios on my 8940. worse, when it was updated (and i have no proof it did happen) i never saw it being updated on the dell boot screen? it was according to the windows update log installing the same one i had installed and was using? possible during the install it recognized that it was already installed and aborted but it was already logged as being installed?i have never had windows update either back-level or install a newer bios on me though?i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! thanks,irv s.fwiw, windows update force-installed a bios update (same version as was installed) on my xps 8930 with uefi capsule updates disabled in bios, only one time - and that was very first time a bios update was offered by windows update.since then, wu has only offered them to me as optional updates, and has never force-installed any of them, with capsule updates disabled, after that first time. surprisingly, wu is still offering me (optional) bios 1.1.26 which i installed manually in mid-oct'22, even though it has already installed 1.1.27 on some xps 8930 pcs, which presumably had capsule updates enabled.and, i manually installed bios 1.1.27 on my xps 8930 last week with none of the terrible consequences most others have had.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeei can attest this also has held true for me . . .from the time i began following the threads regarding firmware updates on the xps desktop community,  this one time occurance with 1.1.18,  i believe, was an anomaly and is an accurate comment on the 8930 model.       \n",

      "content: it took some doing, but i think have the specs i want (listed in full at the end of this post). this system will be for someone who does play some demanding games, so i expect that cpu and gpu usage will get up there. i have three questions for the forum.1. is the 750w psu overkill for this combination of cpu, gpu, ram, and ssd?i7-12700 (not k)nvidia rtx 3060 ti16gb ram2 tb m.2 pcie nvme ssdoptical driveit took some doing even to add the 750w psu, since 460w seems to be the default for this combination of cpu and gpu. one might assume that dell thinks 460w is adequate, but i'm trying to minimize assumptions at this point. we won't be overclocking anything. 2. the cpu i have selected -- 12th gen intel® core™ i7-12700 (25 mb cache, 12 cores, 20 threads, 2.10 ghz to 4.90 ghz turbo) -- is not a k, but there is no price difference between \"standard cpu air cooling\" and \"advanced cpu air cooling.\" does it make sense to select \"advanced cpu air cooling,\" and is there any reason not to?

      "content: i just purchased a xps 8940 (11th gen i7 processor) that came with 16gb ram (2 8gb sticks). since i do photo editing that can sometimes be intense, i wanted to add more ram, so i ordered 2 of these, that were the recommended memory sticks from dell: 16gb - 1rx8 ddr4 udimm 3200mhz. this would give me 48gb ram, which is plenty for what i need to do.i added the additional memory to the open slots on the mb (in this case, the black slots), leaving the original 16gb on board. when i add the additional memory, the computer will not boot.if i remove the original memory and put just the new sticks in their place (the white slots), it will not boot.if i leave the original memory in, and just add one of the new sticks, it will not boot. i switched out the new sticks, and swapped which slot they were in. nothing.if i take out the original memory and move them to the black slots, it will not boot. my guess is that something has to be in the white memory slots.the only thing i can think of is that the memory selector is wrong, or (as unlikely as it must seem), both new memory sticks are bad.when the new memory is installed, i don't even get the dell logo so i can access the bios.i'll try to give dell a call on monday, but in the meantime, i'll accept any suggestions.thanks!thank you! we have received the required details. we will work towards a resolution. in the meantime, you may also receive assistance or suggestions from the community members.#iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".in the course of doing some follow up research, it appears that 48gb of ram may not be an acceptable configuration for the 8940. however, that still doesn't explain why it doesn't work with just 32gb (2 16gb sticks), which appears to be an acceptable configuration.will share some experience (have i7-11700) ...my pc came with two of 8gb 3200 1rx8 (single rank) total 16gb in while clip slots.i've added two of 16gb 3200 1rx8 and pc has booted showing 48gb with one exception - frequency has triggered into 2933 mode instead of 3200.i have tried different configurations swapping black and white slots with new/old sticks or leaving just one new module in - ram was still operating at 2933 frequency.in a result just got another pair of the same new modules (this one worked for me: cheap transcend jm3200hle-16g from memoryc, it has spectek chips on sticks) and it synced all four (new) modules without a problem at 3200 mhz (command rate: cr=1t, gear2 mode - the only a bit slower part unfortunately, but that's by intel specification for i7, should have gone for i9 instead for better ram config), therefore i assume it was just some incompatibility between two batches from different manufacturers.there's one note - first boot after changing memory was taking around 2 minutes, not instant as it was before, but after all automatic internal checks bios part of boot time (dell logo) returned to instant (3-5 seconds?).since you're not saying what ram model you have put in - it's better to be careful and not buy by accident ecc / buffered memory or the one having xmp profile (also brand new from reputable seller works much better / has lower risk, not used one).p.s.1) those configurations you see on specification means what dell has tested and can assure those work, it doesn't necessarily means other configs won't work, they just can't warranty it will work.2) memory controller is located on cpu, although there's some logic on mb (partially bios controlled) for powering ram (voltage regulator for memory, different for cpu).3) memory error code normally has distinct morse sound beeps, therefore not just silent fail (although i think this is probably possible too)@bob f. it is possible that one or both of the new ram modules are bad, although not likely. you should try to install the new modules, one at a time, in dimm1 slot, the white slot closest to the cpu.so...after a lot of great communications with dellcares (thank you), and a lot of swapping modules into various slots, it appears that the problem is that the system simply doesn't like a 48gb configuration.8, 16, 24, 32 and 40gb works (in a variety of configurations), but 48 does not. if i add all 4 modules (48gb), it won't boot, and there are no error beeps or lights, it just doesn't boot.  if i remove any one module from any slot, it will boot.i will probably buy 2 more 16gb modules, which will fill all 4 slots and get me to 64gb, which is an acceptable configuration, and that will likely be the proof of my conclusion that simply is that 48gb doesn't work.have you tried mixing the pairs? put two matched modules (eg, 2x 8 gb) in 1st and 2nd slots from cpu (mismatched retention clip colors). then put the other matched pair in 3rd and 4th slots from cpu (again, mismatched) clip colors).now remove motherboard battery and press/hold power button on pc for ~30 sec. reinstall the battery and see if pc boots properly now.ron   forum member since 2004   i'm not a dell employeei did mix and match the pairs. didn't work. i did not pull the cmos battery, since dellcares did not suggest it.at this point, i am waiting for a couple more 16gb modules to arrive (tomorrow), and will see if 16gb x 4 remedies the issue.since 48gb is not a recommended configuration, it's probably best that i go with something that is recommended.@bob f. i must be missing something because i thought you wrote more than once that 2 x 16 gb (32 gb) did not boot. in fact, didn't you write that you can't understand why 32 gb, an acceptable configuration, did not work? is 2 x 16 gb working now? sorry for the confusion. yes, when i first tried to get this all to work, the 2 x 16gb configuration did not work. or at least i thought it didn't it seems that after you change something (add memory...) the computer makes noises and lights up as if it is booting up and then shuts down. apparently you have to hit the power button again, the first time after changing the configuration. i've never seen a pc do that before. 2 x 16gb may have worked from the beginning after all. (note to dell...your documentation could use some improvement).all that aside, i do know that 48gb absolutely does not work.sorry for the confusion, and thanks for your suggestions.\n",

      "content: i just tried installing dell's new bios for my 8930 (windows 11). it fails every time.i tried using the dell update app, which fails shortly after it says \"installing\" on the screen; and i also tried downloading the exe file from the dell support website,  but when i start the exe, it immediately fails.i have never had a problem installing any of the other bios updates. is there a problem with this update? is anyone else having the same issue? can anyone offer any suggestions?solved!go to solution.i was wrong in my last post. the usb method was successful. i thought it didn't work because the dell system information (in dell update) incorrectly told me that the bios was 1.1.24. after i exited and restarted  dell update it reported the bios as 1.1.26. so the usb method was successful.i agree that you are better off not installing a bios update through the windows environment. the usb method accomplishes that, and does not use windows at all.for the others that had the same issue, please try the usb method of flashing the bios.view solution in original postif this helps anyone to solve my issue, this is the error message from event viewer:faulting application name: xps8930_1.1.26.exe, version: 1.0.5.0, time stamp: 0x61136ba8faulting module name: xps8930_1.1.26.exe, version: 1.0.5.0, time stamp: 0x61136ba8exception code: 0xc0000005fault offset: 0x0000000000098a50faulting process id: 0x0x1404faulting application start time: 0x0x1d8e715d339c678faulting application path: c:\\programdata\\dell\\updateservice\\downloads\\folder09037635m\\1\\xps8930_1.1.26.exefaulting module path: c:\\programdata\\dell\\updateservice\\downloads\\folder09037635m\\1\\xps8930_1.1.26.exereport id: 68776faa-6cb7-42df-91fb-5bfd0b9f6e06faulting package full name:faulting package-relative application id:fwiw i was able to install this update ok via the dell update app......what bios version is your xps-8930 running now?it's better to install them all (meaning any missing ones), in order. click \"other available versions\" to see them.download this file.go to file properties and un-block itrun it.it will write the firmware to the computer's uefi environment work-space.reboot.firmware should install on next startup.https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=cytj5&oscode=wt64a&productco...finally, if the computer is working properly, there is no reason to update the bios (especially if out-of-warranty).i am trying to upgrade from 1.1.24 (which i believe is the previous version). i have already tried installing the xps8930_1.1.26.exe file that you linked in the previous post. when i start that exe file (run as administrator) it immediately exits back to the windows 11 desktop.as i said in my original post, the dell update programs fails while installing, and as i stated above, the xps8930_1.1.26.exe file also fails.not sure what is going on. previous bios updates have installed without any issues.i just tried installing the new bios using the usb method, and that fails too. it looked like the whole process was executing normally, however when it was done, my bios remained at 1.1.24.this is the usb method that i tried:flash using usb method i also verified the checksum on the xps8930_1.1.26.exe file, and it was correct.i recently installed windows 11. is there possibly some new security setting that protects the bios from being changed (that i have to shut off)?i would appreciate any suggestions on how to solve this problem!you would be better off not installing a bios update through the windows environment i just completed the update from 1.1.24 to 1.1.26 with no problems  i was wrong in my last post. the usb method was successful. i thought it didn't work because the dell system information (in dell update) incorrectly told me that the bios was 1.1.24. after i exited and restarted  dell update it reported the bios as 1.1.26. so the usb method was successful.i agree that you are better off not installing a bios update through the windows environment. the usb method accomplishes that, and does not use windows at all.for the others that had the same issue, please try the usb method of flashing the bios.i did it also the usb way and it updated to version 1.1.26, what i dont understand is that dell supportassist want to install  the bios update and it fails , why does dell gives the possibility to update the bios via support assist?   something is not correct but what ?i checked devicemanager and it tells me  in windows 11  system firmware is still 1.1.24, how is this possible  while bios tells me version 1.1.26 ?? \n",

      "content: this is insane. i was prompted by a dell technical email and by supportassist to install the 1.1.27 bios due to a critical nature.closed all unnecessary applications and started the new bios update. the system went through it's paces with clean and stable power going to this unit. upon the 3rd reboot, the dell logo came up and that's where the system stayed. followed all steps to remove all power from the system. powered on and tried to get into the bios setup to no avail - it would stop right on the dell logo again.i called the out of warranty support telephone number and i went through some other trivial troubleshooting steps. they overnighted (2-day) a refurbished motherboard and i installed/configured it with no problems - up to bios 1.1.25.there is a definite problem with any bios release that bricks a system and this 1.1.27 is one of them.does anyone have the same experience?thanks in advance.quite a few did and i expect many more will.  explanation n solution found.https://www.dell.com/community/xps-desktops/xps-8930-bricked-by-xps8930-1-1-27-exe/m-p/8319770#m7810...dell should pull that bios update. their \"technical support\" should have known this.hello.has this 1.1.27 bios update been pulled yet?if not, how do i get around this without bricking my system again and opening the case?i'm up to 1.1.26 at the present time.thank you.@anonymous as of now, that bios update (1.1.27) is still listed as a critical update for my xps 8930 se.dell should pull that bios update, as has been recommended to them by their forum experts, like @rohe .in my personal opinion, it is irresponsible of dell to continue to post a bios update that is borking some computers.just my two cents.  have a great day.regards,phil@dell-bradl @rohe any progress on correcting this bios and reissuing it? is there a progress report on the 1.1.27 bios remediation just yet?tia  finally!the 1.1.27 bios was pulled from the dell website for the xps-8930.thank you.\n",

      "content:  in case some of you haven't noticed from my discussion topics, but i try to give computers the longest use possible. i have an old m14x r1, that has an i7-2630qm, 6gb ddr3, 500gb ssd, and a gt555m. in the past few months i have been having a lot of problems with the graphics. in no chronological order here are the problems: this computer has integrated hd 3000 and gt555m, but neither of them have been showing up in task manager. i have tried updating and rolling back drivers. the gt555m showed up when i rolled them back and i got a whopping 80fps on roblox phantom forces. i was even able to play on max graphics. a few days after that i was lagging again- i have this computer up on mega blocks so thermals shouldn't be the problem- and i think it is because geforce experience updated the drivers by itself. now moving to nvidia control panel. i went to the physx config tab and it says the laptop screen is linked to integrated 3000, which a lot worse than the already horrible gt555m. so i would like to know what is happening with the graphics on this thing because i would actually like to game on this computer a little. today i disabled the integrated in device manager which changed the resolution and also, ironically enough, made the nvidia control panel not even recognize there was an nvidia gpu in the system. so disabling the problems causing thing caused more problems.i realize this computer is really old and isn't worth saving but right now i can't exactly get a better one. i have exactly the same issue, i think it's a faulty mainboard, maybe is a m14x r2 mainboard compatible?\n",

      "content:  hello everyone.i am trying to fix a friends alienware m9700 gaming laptop.i am trying to restore is back to factory fresh condition. that is the alienware skinned win xp pro mce. i have both the respawn dvd and restore cd sets. they are pretty clean, with very light surface scratches.the system was upgraded to 2gb of ram sometime in the past. there is nothing on the either hd that needs to be saved.it appears that the recovery partition was wiped out with a linux install, and a failed vista to win 8 upgrade that will not recover or boot. i do not want these anyway.problem:the system will not read anything from the internal dvd drive. it will not boot either of the recovery discs. it seems like it can't find track 0 to start a read from. it sound like it is resetting every few seconds.i have an external usb dvd/bd drive the system appears to start the boot process.it reads the respawn disk and gives an error. \"tz environment variable not found, cannot use utc times! general failure reading drive p\"with the cd restore disk, it starts to load the xp files then hangs when loading the xp kernel file.i have tried with the usb data cable plugged in to all available ports with no change.i have swapped the position of the ram modules with no change in behavior.i am doing all this on ac power.i have reset the bios to defaults with no change in behavior.i have cleaned the internal dvd drive optical lens and no change in behavior. i have tried to boot both the respawn and restore cd's in a new modern laptop with a built in dvd drive and they do not boot, with dvd as the first boot device.the system is fairly clean on the inside with just a light coat of dust on the fans. the vents look clear. but i put some compressed air through them anyway when i had the back open.i'm kind of stuck on this. any suggestions on what i should try next?thankshi @klund1 welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. the alienware m9700 gaming laptop seemingly predates alienware acquisition by dell. product support did not find alienware m9700 laptop.  alienware aurora m9700 review: alienware aurora m9700 - cnet.  there is dell support for the alienware aurora desktop which might provide drivers. is the plan to install sata ssd with operating system preinstalled? purchase modern sata ssd from ebay would be the best option. then allow operating system to install drivers by internet connection. thanks for the quick reply. that is most kind of you to welcome me into this forum.i will keep the spinning drives for now until i get xp installed. the hard drives are in good working condition. and i do not want to deal with ssd trim in xp.my goal is just to get this back to factory fresh if possible.the included paper 2006 user manual i have states the respawn disk loads norton ghost. then follow onscreen instructions to load disk 2. any idea what version they may used? if my disk is bad, perhaps i can burn a iso and try that.also thanks for letting me know this predates the dell acquisition. i did not know that.here is a pic of the back cover off.thanks for any help anyone could offer. hi @klund1 thank you for sharing update. if hdd is bad, the operating system cannot be installed. guess that you can open bios and enable first look for iso operating system on dvd (if not already enabled). then install operating system, it should ask to format hdd (all files will be lost). thanks again for the reply.the hhd's are good. i have checked them in another system. i have wiped the drives.the problem is i can't get the recovery or respawn cd's to boot fully. cd-rom is selected in the bios as the first boot device.the cd's start to boot then give errors as noted in the first post.again thanks for the help\n",

      "content:  hello, i'm posting about my recent experiences with the alienware m15 r4, which i purchased 5 months ago in november. has anyone else with a windows 11 alienware laptop had issues with the keyboard ceasing to function? sorry for the long post, but i do have some questions at the end.after installing a windows update in late march, i shut my laptop down after installing the update. the next morning, when i went to log back into the computer, the internal keyboard did not work. i didn't realize it at the time, though i've since worked it out with a technician's help, when the computer boots up into windows, the keyboard stops working, and it will continue to not work when restarting. however, on a cold boot after turning the computer off, the keyboard responds fully outside of windows. i can go into bios etc outside of windows and use the keyboard perfectly fine. however, the moment it reaches windows, the keyboard ceases to function. this apparently means that the problem is a driver/software issue, is my understanding.the first tech who came out to my house to deal with the problem disassembled the entire laptop and replaced the keyboard, which did not fix the problem. he insisted that i mail the laptop in for service, and it was mailed to the texas facility where the motherboard and palm rest were both replaced. i suspect that the first tech, who was very young and inexperienced, may have broken said palm rest and panicked, considering the number of times he went outside to call his fiancee. however, that doesn't matter so much since the part was replaced free of cost.the laptop's windows was fully reinstalled etc, and when it arrived at my home, it booted up and worked fine, including the keyboard. however, while testing the laptop, i discovered that the speakers were now broken. again, i suspect the original tech who was sent to my home, but again it doesn't matter how it happened. a second tech was sent out to my house to deal with the speaker problem, and he discovered a broken prong in a connector. when he returned later to replace the board and fix the speaker problem, he learned it was a daughter board problem and not motherboard, so that part has been ordered and will be fixed later. however, after the motherboard was replaced, the original issue of the keyboard non-functioning returned exactly as it originally was. we have come full circle here.additionally, now my 1tb second drive doesn't work anymore. it shows up as \"you need to format the disk in drive  before you can use it.\", and any attempt to format the drive gets stuck/hung up at 51% and refuses to proceed beyond that.everyone involved in the repairs has been phenomenal, and though i do suspect that the hardware damage/issues were caused by the first tech who came to my place, he was very nice and it was clearly unintentional if he is really at fault as i suspect. at this point, once the speaker's daughter board is fixed and the non-functioning hard drive is made to work again, the only problem to remain will be the keyboard issue.the second tech has been incredible to work with, and if i ever need service again i will request him by name. dell has offered to replace my computer with a refurbished computer, though that makes me uncomfortable as i avoid refurbished computers due to a poor experience in the past. i would love to make the laptop i currently have work again, but if the keyboard is going to die every time windows updates, that's discouraging.do drivers for this sort of thing get updated? is this a compatibility issue that will eventually be resolved with updates? since the core problem that sent me to tech support is clearly software/driver, if that gets updated my problem should cease and my computer function properly, right?one way to work around it i've considered is requesting for dell to give me a downgrade to windows 10 (with the option retained to upgrade back to windows 11 when the software issue with the keyboard is confirmed fixed), since windows 10 will be supported until 2025, that gives a few years for a software issue to be sorted out, doesn't it? i understand a downgrade would require a full wipe etc, and i'm perfectly fine with that - it's still wiped from the last time i tried reinstalling windows 11 to fix the keyboard problem.has anyone else had a similar keyboard problem with their windows 11 alienware m15 r4? have you managed to fix it? how did you fix it? is this something that will be addressed/fixed in an update to the driver(s) in the future? i understand that the motherboard is from alienware itself?solved!go to solution.for me this is the workaround, works every time.shutdown laptopturn on laptopkeyboard will not workpress power button to enter sleep moderesume laptop from sleep modelogin/unlock laptop (i use the on screen keyboard by clicking on accessibility in bottom right) to enter my passwordopen device managergo to universal serial bus controllersuninstall the unknown usb devicethen right click scan for hardware changeskeyboard works again till next shutdown/restart.bios alienware 1.10.1, 3/28/2022windows 11 with all updates installedall dell supportassist updates installedi have tried downgrading to previous 1.9.0 and 1.8.0 version of the bios and still same issue. have tried reinstalling/update all dell/alienware related drivers.view solution in original postwow finally i have found someone who no longer makes me think im crazy and can confirm when i have to tell every customer service person it is not a hardware issue. long story short did a windows 11 update on 4/13/22 then had to do a restart like with any update and that was the last time i have spoken to my keyboard lol. when i originally tried resolving it and basically till i found ur post every person made me feel like its a hardware issue and they have never heard of anything of this nature happening. i have been waiting till i had more free time to fully deal with this as i am currently using my latop with a wireless keybaord ontop of my internal keyboard lol. i need my laptop for my job and it is very important to me so im waiting till things slow down with my job where i can do whatever has to be done with this. anyway please tell me what i need to do and is there a cure out there lol bc ive tried everything in the book even a factory reset to windows ten and it still wont work . this has been an absolute nightmare for me to deal with and its insane how dell and even microsoft made it seem like my laptops issue is something the world has never seen or dealt with before. its also crazy how i only have found u where this has happened to. like are we the worlds unluckiest human beings or something. my name is cj btw.it's definitely a driver issue, i have gotten my keyboard working on windows 11 only for it to periodically stop working. i have had some luck uninstalling all the devices under keyboard category on device manager and under universal serial bus controllers, but the problem will randomly return, and sometimes uninstalling all the devices doesn't fix it. i have gotten it working again through repeatedly doing this but it's extremely frustrating and time consuming.i shutdown and powered up my laptop dell m15 r4, keyboard stopped working again.steps i used to make keyboard work again...on windows 11 i pressed accessibility in bottom right to access the on screen keyboard, logged in, accessed device manager.expanded universal serial bus controllersuninstalled device called unknown usb device (device descriptor request failed)right click - scan for hardware changes.keyboard works again, not sure why but it keeps doing this for me, likely some sort of driver issue. i have tried reinstalling alienware command center, chipset drivers, etc. this is as narrowed down as i could get it.in addition to the steps above, it didn't work again after restarting and doing those steps. pressing power button to enter sleep mode and exit sleep mode then repeating the above steps would fix it.the daughterboard has been replaced. while the tech was present, i uninstalled the unknown usb device driver under device management, then scanned for hardware changes. when it did not reinstall an unknown usb drive the keyboard worked. i then restarted the computer. the keyboard did not work on restart.when i next uninstalled the unknown usb driver, hardware changes scan reinstalled the same driver. keyboard did not function again at any step of this process.next, i will be installing windows 10 to see if the keyboard works in windows 10. if the keyboard works in windows 10, and does not fail, i will consider it fixed enough unless the problem resurfaces. if the keyboard does not work even in windows 10,or the problem comes back even in windows 10, i am all out of ideas for how to fix it and will contact dell support directly for next steps on exchanging the faulty product.did you try putting it in sleep mode and then waking it up again and trying the steps, after restart my keyboard stopped working as well. that seems to consistently work for me. obviously this isn't really an acceptable experience though i suspect it's something with windows 11 and the drivers.i will try that before i try the windows 10 install. is that something you have to do every time you start it up? if so that's not a good long term solution for me.so far it seems to be working when i do the trick i hope they fix the driver issues though, clearly it's not hardware, keyboard always works fine in bios. windows 10 should be fine as i think this only happened after a march-april windows 11 update. haven't tested windows 10 to be sure.i tried it, and that did not work for me, thank you!\n",

      "content:  hi there,i would like to ask you guys if there is any ways to lower the power consumption of the laptop?when i use my alienware x15 r1, it is using ~10w of power when it is on battery. so i can work, use my laptop for browsing and default stuffs. but when it is plugged in and i do nothing it is consuming ~60w in idle. so i am curious if there is any option to have only 10w of power usage when it is plugged in.i've tried to set windows 11 to power efficient mode, and to set the awcc to quiet in fan speed, but it is still eating a lot when i do nothing.sadly most of the times i have no time to play, so it would be ok for me if i have to manually change something to save energy.thank you,roberthi @popecrob  welcome to this free user to user alienware laptop discussion forum. the alienware x15 r1 is designed for high performance when gaming and powered by the ac adapter (charger). for more demanding games with higher gpu requirement, power is also taken from the battery. when ac adapter is first connected to laptop, its first priority is to charge the battery so that it gets fully charged (100%). please have a look at solved: x15 r1, 2.5 hour battery life - dell community hi,thank you. i agree with you on how a plugged in laptop should work. like charge the battery and give more power to the cpu and gpu. the problem that it is controlled by a software/driver somehow. as i think mostly by the oc driver for command center. i am curious that the power management could be manipulated somehow to consume less power while plugged in. so that is my point.thanks!hi @popecrob thank you for sharing update. the alienware  laptop's intelligent charging profile includes drawing just sufficient power to run the laptop when there is little activity. however, please be aware that alienware laptops are designed for high gaming performance and when quiescent will draw more power when compared with a general-purpose very basic laptop. users should not try and change the intelligent alienware charging profile. using the ac adapter to power the laptop will extend battery life. i'm having a similar problem, i've had my alienware m11 for nearly 2 years and has been working fine on the laptop charger it cape with, but now upon boot it is demanding a 240watt charger and is losing battery while plugged in. what can i do to fix thisthankstristan \n",

      "content:  hi alli've been having an incredibly frustrating audio issue on my system, and have been unable to get it fixed.basically what is going on is the audio on the system stops working randomly when i switch between applications or load up videos. for instance i will do a fresh reboot of the system and when it loads it plays the windows startup sound. however once in windows ill open a video in vlc or go to chrome and the audio will no longer work. there is no indication of a driver failure or that the system is switching anything from what i can tell. the only way to get the audio back is so switch between inputs in the taskbar menu. i have tried reinstalling drivers, using different driver versions, uninstalling the audio devices, and tweaking the windows sounds settings for the device all with no success.if anyone else has had this issues and found a resolution i would really appreciate the help. i can't pinpoint when exactly this started happening either.thanks solved!go to solution.i think i have had the same sound issues on my m15 after a clean install. i took some time figuring out the cause but i found the following: the issue is caused by a combination of the latest version of awcc (5.5.26.0) and the latest realtek audio driver (version 6.0.9394.1). i did not have a sound issue when awcc was not yet installed,i fixed the issue by installing the previous realtek driver (version 6.0.8996.1). this driver does not give any problems when awcc is installed.hope this helpsview solution in original postsmall update but just had the motherboard on the system replaced, and the problem still persists right after a clean windows installation. is anyone else running into this issue? im wondering if it’s a driver issue? im using the latest for my system from the dell website. this issue is pretty annoying because you have to keep switching the input to get audio back or if i disable audio enhancements or any other setting in the sound device.any help would be greatly appreciated.check volume levels and muted outputsfirst, you should get the most obvious fix out of the way. if you have no sound on your computer, double-check to make sure that you haven't muted the audio. click the volume icon at the bottom-right corner of your computer to check the master volume bar; make sure it's not muted or set at an extremely low level. if it's muted, you'll see an x next to the speaker icon.after this, right-click on the same volume icon and choose open volume mixer to see the current volume level for all apps playing audio. turn these up as needed, confirming that they aren't muted by mistake or too low to hear. you may need to troubleshoot low audio output if you hear sound but it's too quiet. regards,johnhey johnthose were actually all the things i first tried but nothing was out of the ordinary. this is happening on a completely fresh installation of windows, even after repeated reformat attempts. if it was a hardware issue i would have thought that the motherboard replacement would have fixed that but it hasn't. the audio simply stops working if i switch between open applications and the desktop. it will then randomly come back when switching between different programs or going into the speaker settings and changing something like enhanced audio from on to off. if i have multiple outputs available switching between those also works.i can't even begin to think of what other hardware component could be replaced at this point if it is indeed hardware since the speakers actually do work. i would think a fresh install of windows would eliminate any driver or software issue but that doesn't seem to be the case either.this is really puzzling.i am right there with you.  annoying af.  i have not gone through the whole support process, because truthfully, i find them useless.what i have found is that when i lose my sound, normally if i am viewing programming videos and go to evernote to take notes, and go back, i lose my sound.  what i do to resolve is go into the sound volume details page, and toggle something like mono on and off again;.  this seems to fix it temporarily.i have not found a permanent solution yet.i've been having the exact same issue with my x17 r1 since about a month ago. sound cutting off sometimes when switching between apps, and toggling \"mono audio\" seems to be only thing that resets it without a reboot. all drivers up to date, all the newest windows updates installed (windows 11). everything worked fine before so i'm suspecting a driver/windows update actually broke it. haven't found any permanent solution either, but good to know it's not just me having this issue...as bad as it sounds i'm actually happy to see others having this issue because it means its not something with my system.this has been driving me absolutely nuts because its so random. the only solutions to restoring the audio i have found are the ones both @daveofthedogs and @j4b6ski have mentioned as well as toggling the sound output between devices if you have more then one. i have some external speakers connected to the headphone jack so i can switch between that and the internal speakers, and it restores the audio.i have a feeling this is happening because of one of the more recent cumulative windows updates. this started happening for me around a month maybe two ago. i had to have the motherboard replaced due to a usb issue and i was really hopeful that would fix the problem but it didn't. i have done several clean installs and played with a variety of different driver combinations, from the original shipped drivers to the latest windows update drivers and nothing has worked.turning off exclusive mode in the advanced sound options seems to prolong the issue but not eliminate it. would be really nice if we could bring this to dells attention in a more serious manner. not sure what the best method for that is though.if i stumble across a solution ill be sure to post it. i think i have had the same sound issues on my m15 after a clean install. i took some time figuring out the cause but i found the following: the issue is caused by a combination of the latest version of awcc (5.5.26.0) and the latest realtek audio driver (version 6.0.9394.1). i did not have a sound issue when awcc was not yet installed,i fixed the issue by installing the previous realtek driver (version 6.0.8996.1). this driver does not give any problems when awcc is installed.hope this helps @n1c0 would you have a link to those drivers? i am not finding them in my driver dashboard when using my st. i only have 6.0.9168.1, a01 and 6.0.9244.1, a02 but i have tried both of those with no luck.@riftwire here are the links to both versions:version 6.0.9394.1 from dell support version 6.0.8996.1 from dell support you can also find these versions on the microsoft websiteversion 6.0.9394.1 version 6.0.8996.1 hopefully this solution will work for you too. \n",

      "content:  i have had my m15 r4 for a little over a year and what a year it has been. a few months into getting my really expensive m15 r4, the motherboard went out. after dell came out and replaced it the top was all scratched up. the dell technicians said my laptop was all good and ready to go until now the keyboard went out, which dell had someone come out and fix. once i came home to my laptop the keyboard felt nice and it was awesome, but it was short lived. once i noticed the touchpad was all messed up and not working at all. upon taking to the technician these two problems were also from the manufacture same with the motherboard problem. after calling them again today i was told that i could not get it replaced with a new one because it’s been past 30 days, which is weird to me because i pay a lot of money for the premium support and it seems now that the whole computer is defective straight from the manufacturer but i have to get a replacement refurbished one. this also isn’t ideal because i’ve had a lot of interaction with how dell fixes and puts new parts on laptops and when they go into fix something they just break something else. i was originally very excited about my purchase but upon further inspection this company is not good and the products are even worse. i would not recommend this company to anyone unless your willing to pay for premium support your whole life and just getting replacement refurbished laptops about once a year. hi @tommy1111 welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. please click on product support to identify and share model and revision number, example x17 r2. i added the system model to the title. they stated dell policy correctly.any system exchange done after the first 30 days from the original dell invoice date will be a like for like refurbished exchange.if still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session.find your service tagyes but this is a poor policy especially because all of my problems i’ve had are from the manufacture, meaning y’all sold me a 4000$ broken computer to start with. and now that ive had y'all's certified technicians fix my computer, they break or scratch my 4000$ computer and in return your giving me a used computer. sad policy will not buy again. also in top of it once i get this new computer y’all are going to make me buy the dell migrate to get my files over to the new computer more money i’m just throwing at y’all. very poor experience and like i said i would never recommend this to anyone. hi @tommy1111 thank you for sharing update. it is your responsibility to ensure that all drives are cloned (copied). all data on replacement system will be as delivered by dell on the original invoice. dell does not migrate your data onto replacement system. you could request to continue to use original system for a few days until after delivery of replacement system, and swop over your drives before original is collected by dell. it is dells responsibility to offer good quality products so this doesn’t have to happen. and when it does happen that there is a defective product it is dells responsibility to fix the defective product i spent 4000$ on. but instead y’all are sending a refurbished computer that i’ll have to pay the 50$ to y’all to get the dell migrate because yalls computers don’t work. i did nothing wrong only cared for my laptop to the best of my ability but y’all sent me a defective product. now i have to get a refurbished computer and spend more money to get the dell migrate all because y’all sent me a defective product. such a sad situation i’m not a fan of the refurbished computer but i’ll accept it if it’s my only option. but the really messed up part is how i have to pay for the dell migrate software and y’all won’t just give it to me. it’s only 50$ and i feel i should get way more compensation after y’all sent someone to my house and broke the touchpad. and after further inspection last night the casing of the laptop wasn’t even put on right. the back is all bowing out just looks horrible. i pay for the warranty so y’all can come to my house trash my laptop then make me give y’all more money to keep all my files. \n",

      "content:  i purchased this laptop 12/2021 and it has been a constant headache since. first issue was some undetermined issue with my keyboard where they had to send a technician to my address twice. now 8 months after purchasing the laptop,  $2,500 might i add, the \"s\" key is starting to chip in paint? and this is the cherry wood mechanical keyboard i spent an extra $150 on to have. this is not acceptable on the cost i spent on this laptop. hi @cadover welcome to this free user to user alienware laptop discussion forum. your alienware x17 r1 continues to be under first year dell warranty. you should continue to use your dell warranty and not try and fix these hardware issues yourself. it is dell policy that if the same problem cannot be fixed on three separate occasions, dell will provide a different system whose refurbished specification is equal to or better than the alienware x17 r1 that was ordered. i purchased this laptop and spent extra to get the cherrywood mechanical keyboard as well.  after getting it replaced more than once, the s key cap is still messed up in the first year of owning this product. i opened a service request and was never responded to only for the service request to get closed. i then reached out today to figure out why they closed it before my warrenty expired and what we can do to resolve this only for them to give me the run around. after getting transferred 3 times, each person trying to pass the blame to the next department; it just disconnects without warning \"no agent available\". worst customer service, ever. i will never get another alienware again.hi @cadover welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. please click on @dell-cares to send private message to request internal investigation to determine why your earlier in‑warranty service request did not get response and was prematurely closed.  i will reach out to dell-cares and see if any resolution comes from this, but i'm not holding my breath.at this point i\"m less then impressed with the experience i have had in this $2,500 \"gaming laptop\" i got. it's not the same quality as it was back when i got my first one.yup, the same exact run around i got when i called dell with this problem is what @dell-cares gave me.thank you for the information. our records indicate that your system warranty has expired. one of the community users may reach out to you in some time.i point out i made the claim during the warranty, want to know why it was closed. and the above is the response i got. i'm done with dell.<violation as defined by dell removed. read the forum code of conduct. dell-admin>\n",

      "content:  i have an m17 r4 laptop, purchased a few months ago. about a week and a half ago a problem began, where the keyboard wasn't working at all. none of the keys worked. rebooting didn't fix it, system restore didn't work, driver reinstall didn't work. an external keyboard connected to the laptop worked fine. ultimately i fully reinstalled windows, and it seemed like that fixed it. but within a day or two, the problem had returned. this time, reinstalling windows completely didn't fix it.  the symptoms are:probably the most important thing: any time the keyboard fails, i will see a failing usb device in the device manager, and one of the \"hid keyboard device\" entries will be gone. the failed usb device is called: unknown usb device (device descriptor request failed). any time that's present here, the keyboard doesn't work. in the few times the keyboard has started working again, this entry will go away, and i'll see the \"hid keyboard device\" again under keyboards. this is shown in one of the screenshots.the keyboard does work perfectly when in bios screens. i went into diagnostics in the boot options, and i can test all the keys, and they work there.similarly, i can hit f2 / f12 on startup to enter bios settings or boot settings.however, once i get to the alienware logo, and i see the wait spinner appear, that's when the keyboard stops responding. up until then, i can toggle caps/numlock. but once that wait spinner appears, the keyboard is non-functional.after booting into windows, one part of the keyboard works: i can toggle the t-pad via fn-f11 (t-pad) key. that's the only key that works.all of the rgb lighting works.external usb keyboard works fine.i also decided to see if the keyboard worked if i ran ubuntu off a thumb drive. short version: the keyboard doesn't work in ubuntu either. it works while i'm selecting some boot options, but then when it actually loads ubuntu, i see the usb errors listed here: i've spent a long time searching for solutions to \"unknown usb device (device descriptor request failed)\", hoping to resolve this. but so far there has been no lasting solution. here are the specific things i've done. with all of these things, i've done them several times so far over the course of the this past week.reset bios settings to defaults, save and restartflash the bios. i've tried four different bios revisions from dell's website, trying them one at a time, with no change.delete entries from device manager and rescan for hardware changes, including uninstalling usb root hub. on one occasional, as soon as i deleted the usb root hub, and rescanned for hardware changes, the keyboard started working again. that hasn't worked on subsequent failures.fully reinstall windows with a clean format, using an install media from microsoft's site (not dell's recovery media). it's worth mentioning that even when reinstalling windows, the keyboard already doesn't work on screens like setting up partitions. for example, i can't enter in numbers for the partition sizes. so, just getting out of the bios, the keyboard's already dead.unplugged power supply, help down power button for 30 seconds.system restoreopened the backpanel, reseated the battery, and reconnected the three cables leading into the keyboard controller. (i didn't go any deeper into the laptop than that.)called dell several times. we're now at the stage where they just want to replace the motherboard, which is super annoying because i'm outside the us for several months, so there's no practical way to do that.right now, it feels like there's some random chance that doing a system restore, a clean windows install, or a reboot, can very occasionally get the keyboard working again. everything will look fine in the device manager, and the keyboard will work perfectly for a day or two. i can reboot and it comes back fine. but then eventually on a reboot, it will break again, and remain stubbornly broken for a long time. today i've rebooted a dozen times, done driver installs, bios flashes, fully formatted and reinstalled windows, and it's still not coming back.so, i'm hoping someone might have some other ideas on what i might try to resolve this. i've tried everything i can find on any article discussing \"device descriptor request failed\", but nothing consistently works, or prevents this from recurring.my vague feeling is that this may be a loose connector in the laptop, but i don't know. maybe it really is a complete hardware failure, but i'm hoping to find some solution i can do myself.thanks.solved!go to solution.i figured i'd follow up on this in case it helps anyone else. i ultimately went down the path of hardware replacement. dell first replaced the keyboard itself, but that didn't correct the behavior. next, they replaced the \"daughterboard\", and that also didn't help. finally, they replaced the entire system board / motherboard, and that corrected the issue.view solution in original postthis sounds identical to the problem in my thread. in my case full motherboard replacement worked once, but then the motherboard was replaced again (as a mistaken part for an unrelated speaker issue) and in the second motherboard replacement the keyboard problem came back. in my case dell is fully replacing my laptop.  view solution in original posthi @dangoyette  welcome to this free user to user alienware laptop discussion forum. this is not dell support. thank you for providing an exceptionally good opening post complete with images. if system has premium support plus warranty, international support should get dell assigned contractor to visit and fix this problem. consumer support servicesusually the user can fix this problem by visiting device manager and deleting driver that has the yellow triangle against it. restart (not shut down) to save this change. ensure connection to internet when system boots so that windows operating system automatically installs the correct driver. if this driver problem keeps returning, dell should fix this problem by remote access to the system. raise service request, explain the driver problem, and request fix by dell remote access. dell should also deploy their suite of diagnostic software to determine the root cause, which might say replacement motherboard is required. the ubuntu diagnostic seems to suggest that bios is not fully installed. never install bios over the internet, always download onto system and follow the installation instructions. if the downloaded file fails integrity check, repeat download. [this user does not work for dell and volunteers their free time. please remember to say thank you by clicking on kudos as this user's only reward.] thanks very much for the reply. following-up on the premium support option sounds like a really good first step for me. i wasn't aware of that.the other specific troubleshooting steps, i've already tried those several times, so unfortunately it really does feel like this is coming down to a hardware replacement. thanks for putting me on the premium support track.i've ended up having a bit more progress on this issue. i'm still not sure whether to believe that it's hardware related, or software related. but it seems that i've found some workaround to the issue, at least so far.when i was in device manager, i found that there was another device that was faulty, a bluetooth radio:that has a yellow ! next to it. when i uninstalled it, and scanned for hardware changes, i found that the generic bluetooth radio came back with a ! on it still, but that the keyboard was suddenly working. however, upon restarting the computer, the keyboard stopped working again. but, i found that if i uninstalled the generic bluetooth radio and uninstalled the failed usb device, then scanned for hardware changes, there was probably a 50/50 chance that the keyboard would work. after that, i disabled the generic bluetooth radio, as you can see in the image. and now when i reboot, the keyboard keeps working.my current theory is that this could still be hardware related, but more of a race condition of whether the keyboard will try to connect to the system through some faulty channel. it seems like i've locked the generic bluetooth radio to the faulty hardware channel, which allows the keyboard to use a different channel. but i have no idea how hardware works at that low level to know if that makes any sense at all.i'll have to see whether the keyboard keeps working from now on or not. so far, doing what i did above, the keyboard has kept working through several reboots, which it wasn't doing before, so maybe that's a good sign.well, just for posterity, the \"solution\" in my previous post isn't reliable. although the keyboard remained working after rebooting several times, after another reboot it stopped working again, with the keyboard listed as \"unknown usb device (device descriptor request failed)\" again.as best as i can tell, it really just seems that any time i uninstall this \"unknown usb device (device descriptor request failed)\", there's a small chance it will correctly install the keyboard. but most of the time it immediately comes back again as \"unknown usb device (device descriptor request failed)\"again, i don't have enough hardware experience to judge whether this erratic behavior is consistent with some kind of hardware failure.hi @dangoyette thank you for sharing your troubleshooting. most of the hardware is controlled by internal to motherboard usb connections, and when this fails replace motherboard is the only fix. however, this problem seems to be intermittent driver conflict which is not easy to troubleshoot, as you have already discovered. the generic software fix is to run check disk on the os(c:) boot drive. this is a very powerful tool that will search for and automatically fix any file conflicts. disk error checking: how to run chkdsk in windows 11/10 (thewindowsclub.com) the generic find hardware fault is post during boot, but no post diagnostics led diagnostic lights were reported. post does not check everything. the dell epsa diagnostics can be run by holding down the f12 key when the alienware splash screen appears. epsa pre boot system assessment dell overview (official dell tech support) - youtube speculate the bluetooth driver problem could be wi-fi adapter card is not fully seated. reseat wi-fi adapter card in its slot, might be a fix. its hard to know if reseat will stop more driver problems being created. to try and find root cause of these problems, run reliability monitor to create a timeline of events. wait for timeline to be created. look at the event entries for today, as problems occur today. hopefully whatever the system is unhappy about will reveal itself by reoccurring event. open this event to see if root cause has been identified together with microsoft error code. a search on the internet should reveal similar problem and its fix might be your solution. sorry for not being specific, this troubleshooting should work. if not, create dell service request and let them troubleshoot this problem. once again, thank you for the detailed response, and the leads to follow. chkdisk resulted in no errors, as did the preboot tests. for the other steps, i'll probably hold off until i can confirm whether i can get international support via the premium support. (i'll hopefully hear back from dell on that in the next day or so.) popping these laptops open and reseating things is something i'm only marginally comfortable doing myself.i figured i'd follow up on this in case it helps anyone else. i ultimately went down the path of hardware replacement. dell first replaced the keyboard itself, but that didn't correct the behavior. next, they replaced the \"daughterboard\", and that also didn't help. finally, they replaced the entire system board / motherboard, and that corrected the issue.hi @dangoyette, congratulations on the issue getting fixed!it seemed like a software issue was the major culprit in this but physically replacing the motherboard did the job. i recently started having the similar problem with my m15 r4 laptop which i got in late jan 2022. i contacted the premium support, and they initiated the replacement of the keyboard. meanwhile, i started experimenting in the device manager with the \"unknown usb device device descriptor request failed\". what seemed to work temporarily for me is uninstalling this and immediately putting the system to sleep. but, once the system gets rebooted or put to sleep again, the problem reappears.\n",

every few days lines like above, sometimes works normal (very rarely).  trying to educate myself this is what i am (guessing).  if i screen capture black screen and drag \"snipped image\" to external

      "content:  hello, my new x17 r2 refuses to operate with my external monitor.my unit has the 3080 ti/12900hk combo along with the 360hz 1080p lcd panel.judging by what i have observed during all this, it seems the system is sending the wrong parameters to the external monitor. i have tried everything, including disabling optimus and g-sync, and nothing seems to work. i have spent a good amount of time on this, on both my system settings and my external monitor settings, really going through everything short of setting my own custom resolution on my system. it seems my display has also sort of black listed this device from connecting. it seems the device is trying to force my 60hz 4k external display to operate in 360hz with corresponding h/v frequencies which is why my display is now treating it as something which i assume is  incompatible. am i not allowed to use my new laptop with an external monitor? this x17 r2 laptop is the only device which refuses to cooperate with my monitor. i don't understand how such an issue remains unresolved? i would also assume using an external monitor would be relatively common among x17 owners. really hoping someone could drop in with useful advice. thanks. hi @and0r welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. your new alienware x17 r2 laptop purchase has a minimum of first year dell warranty. dell expects users to connect external monitors. please visit your online dell account and create service request so that dell support knows there is a problem to fix. dell technical support should request online session to use their diagnostic tools to fix software interface problems or instigate hardware replacement. how to daisy chain multiple monitors using displayport multi-stream transport (mst) | dell us yes, im purposely trying to avoid even mentioning customer support, as i don't wish to seem critical. but i suppose there is no way to avoid even mentioning this.my experience with dell customer service has been horrendous. it's quite literally the worst i have seen for any reputable company. there is no possible way i would consider using this for anything even remotely technical. and i really don't wish to seem critical, but this is the absolute truth. it's why i'm posting here in hopes someone else may be able to help. i really don't wish to explain my experiences with them further, they really are quite ridiculous. and i'm not here to criticize them. thank you. here are some more details for anyone who is willing to assist.im using certified hdmi 2.0 and 2.1 cables for everything, and they are also known to work. the external display i'm using is a sony x80j which is also officially designed to be compatible with pc and does indeed work just fine with other pcs connected to it. i'm quite certain my x17 laptop is not correctly handling the display.all my x17 system drivers are updated. and i've even gone through the task of reinstalling my entire operating system just to resolve this issue. so i have actually tested this on both versions of windows 11. both on 22h1 which was installed by the factory and also on 22 h2 which i installed myself from the ground up using a clean image directly from microsoft.the unit refuses to cooperate with my display no matter what i do. i spend so much time on this already. i am pretty much done and hoping someone just knows what's going on and can offer a simple solution. im also using the included power adapter with my system. really, i have spent so much time with this, i dont believe there is any possible thing which i have missed. same results here.  best resolution i've gotten with a sumsung q60aa 75\" is 1280x1024.  i've had no issues using an older dell laptop with the same cables at 1920x1080.  there is clearly something wrong and dell support has been worthless - all my calls end with \"technical support is in a meeting - call back later\"!!!it's the intel optimus technology. and it's also something to do with how the display manages devices connected to it. it's sort of groups the device inputs into a package... i know this is a very crude explanation of it. please excuse me...  of course i'm not sure how the internal programming of the display operates, but to me it just seems that way. it also seems to be a problem with the display receiving two different type of parameters coming from the laptop. one from intel optimus and the other one from the dedicated nvidia graphics, at least once again i would assume. this is all really quite ridiculous because it seems that intel is operating a non-standard display architecture which is not compatible with standard display function or protocol. it's really quite ridiculous to release this type of product on the market which would obviously create incompatibilities. but intel decides to just do it anyway. and it's dell's responsibility to make sure the technology they include is actually functioning properly. to not be able to connect your device to a display is quite ridiculous. especially when the display officially supports connections from a pc. i'm the tech hired gun for newuser737 - called in after she had dell support remote into her machine and try to \"fix\" it.  i did get her machine to finally manage an hdmi connection to the q60aa 75\" tv that her company uses to display kitchen designs to customers.first thing to do is open device manager and then display adapters - there should be two, one for the intel adapter built into the processor and one for the 3080ti.  initially i found only one and it was for the basic windows video driver!  i uninstalled that and then reran the p&p which installed the correct intel driver.next trick was to make sure that the intel driver saw the alienware laptop display, not the generic pnp.  try running the detect function on the display or reboot to get that.next i installed the nvidia universal driver from the nvidia website, ignoring their warning that the laptop vendor version is usually better.  once i could open the  nvidia control panel the tv magically appeared as connected in the nvidia control panel.  to simplify things, i then made the 3080ti the display adapter for both the build in monitor and the tv.  so just cloned the laptop display to the tv, set the resolution to 1920x1080, and got a blank on the tv.  finally started fooling around with the display frequency settings and after the obvious ones (30hz, 60hz, and 120hz) all failed, found that the 59.???hz setting made it work - finally a cloned laptop screen on the big tv, just as the customer wanted!i got greedy and tried the 4k settings on both the laptop and tv but no joy.  customer was fine with just hd for now.  if i have time i'll try fooling with the refresh rates at the 4k setting for the tv and maybe that might work.all this was under windows 11, which i don't yet recommend for my customers, so the steps above may be a bit hard to follow and my terms not official microsoft vocabulary but it did finally work.  if i can lay my hands on the machine again i'll try to fill out the approach in detail.yes, i was able to do this. but it still doesn't work right. especially when the external display is set as the only output. it will crash your display whenever the computer reboots. the igpu seems to do a better job of handling it. the display seems to crash whenever the dgpu is involved. probably has something to do with how some displays manage connections. which would again suggest that intel is using non standard methods which are incompatible with many displays. but i also feel this could be resolved by any vendor such as dell with the right drivers or firmware to be even more specific, whoever designs motherboards for dell, probably someone from india, should maybe consider spending the extra 25 cents for an additional hdmi port which is exclusively dedicated to the nvidia gpu and nothing else. really quite ridiculous to allow such a premium laptop to be crippled this way. like nobody considers it useful to have a laptop which can actually function with an external display. \n",

      "content:  due to lack of information and misinformation on dells site around this i decided to post this. i've unfortunately got a $3000 lemon of a laptop because dell in their wisdom decided to only have one usb-c port on the m15 r7 which is unable to operate to its full specification.i bought the laptop specifically for vr use and development and i am unable to connect it with my valve index headset because the usb-c is not directly connected to the nvidia gpu, even with optimus turned off in the bios. even the bios says that all displays will be driven by the nvidia gpu if optimus is turned off , only to find that this is not the case .this glaring hardware limitation is not mentioned anywhere in the specifications on the website and considering it is the only usb-c (dp 1.4) connection on the laptop its a very dumb decision to make. from what i can tell, the previous version m15 r6 did not have this limitation. i could have easily gone with a lenovo or asus of the same specs and price which do not have this limitation either as they have separate usb-c ports with dp 1.4 function.so as i've just went over my one month return period before finding this out, i have no options available to me other than to eat this maybe try and sell it and buy another laptop. this was my first alienware laptop and i do like it , despite other issues which i was willing to over look, but this particular issue defeats the purpose of purchasing it in the first place and has made this an expensive mistake dell wont take responsibility for.the annoying thing is i really wanted to buy the legion 5i pro but it wasn't in stock at the time with the specs i needed. after doing more research i've found that the same issue will effect you if you have a  g-sync compatible monitor using dp to work with the laptop. so its not just for vr but also your fast refresh external monitors using dp via usb-c.hi @vi5h welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. the faq alienware laptops (updated october 26, 2022) - dell community has the which ports output dgpu? image whose list includes the alienware m15 r7 with nvidia graphics. hi @crimsom . thank you for that information. i wish it was widely available at the time i was deciding to purchase the laptop . this sort of thing should be on every laptops specification page to allow buyers to make informed decisions. i think it's highly shady of manufacturers to leave out this information essentially duping customers into buying their product.hi @vi5h thank you for sharing your valid observation. in a user-to-user context it seems that you should visit your online dell account to create a service request as a 'formal complaint' and request it be expediated to a senior dell tier that is authorised to review and who might grant your remedy. your opening post includes that the 'within the first 30 days reject option' could have been used as your remedy because this vr limitation was not published by dell. hey @crimsom . thanks for the advice. i'll look into submitting a formal complaint as you mentioned. i have serious doubts it will help but anything is worth a try.  i just noticed they edited my title and told me that i cannot tell other people in the forum to not buy something from them...lol. well maybe you shouldn't sell products that don't function as they should and not mention it anywhere  ?hi @vi5h thank you for sharing update. dell tries not to have unhappy customers. if you never explore the senior dell complaints process, you will never know what they might decide. yes, this free user-to-user community forum is provided by dell and they have their forum code of conduct that you signed up to having opened an account. i am having the same issues as you are, i am also trying to get a refund.... and i believe we should.... since, on the official sales page, it never mentions that the usb-c is not connected to the dgpu... please update us when you have something new@silvereyed welcome to the club....lol.i haven't gotten around to following up with dell yet but if you are also doing so please update your situation when you get a chance. it is honestly... very very sad...it is a beautiful machine. i do love it....but some how.. it cant be used for what its supposed to do. i think the only solution is either get a refund or get a replacement from the x series. x15r2 and x17r2 confirmed will work. (x17r2 even has its own dp port)hi @silvereyed welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. if alienware m15 r7 purchased from dell with dell warranty, within the first 30 days you have option to reject system that does not function as advertised. there should be no restocking, etc. penalty. dell refund policy, new vs refurbished - dell community. a full refund is normally the best option. wait for dell to collect alienware m15 r7 laptop. \n",

      "content:  i’ve literally spent 2 weeks, dozens and dozens of hours on this. even more strange is, that if i choose blue leds for the keyboard, and keep the brightness below 8%, the keyboard stays connected – if i turn the brightness any higher, or choose any other color or effect (spectrum, morph, etc), the hid keyboard disconnects in device manager and typing is impossible – the keyboard lights up like a vega$ billboard, though  - i have the 4 zone rgb keyboard.here’s what i’ve tried, and had zero luck with resolving this issue (see pics for reference) – complete shutdown and startup after each attempt:1. sounds like an issue related to power draw on usb ports right? i’ve unchecked every device in device manager that has the option ‘allow the computer to turn off this device to save power’.2. installed any/all available bios updates, hid and keyboard drivers/firmware found on dell support (i’ve even tried different patterns of installing updates, to try and isolate the error).3. disabled usb selective suspend in advanced power settings.4. installed latest version of awcc. uninstalled, and reinstalled about 8 earlier version of awcc to see if that helped – same problem. even tried the awcc (5.4.9.0) that the windows store has available. no go.i run the usblogview app to monitor usb event changes. i can watch the keyboard disconnect in realtime, as i try and turn on the rgb lights. looks like ‘port 10 hub 1 usb composite device is the problem port and winusb device 14 is also affected (see pics for reference)same result after fresh install of windows 10 from usb bootable devicesame result after fresh install of windows 11 from usb bootable devicesame result after reverting back to fresh install of windows 10 from usb bootable devicereally scratching my head on this one. i’m at my wits end, and can’t think of anything else to do. i’ve installed and reinstalled the os a total of 5 times so far, trying different patterns of installing updates, to no avail. my warranty expired november 2021 so i’m hoping someone else may have experienced this and can help! i did find another thread here for x17 r1 users who are experiencing the same problem and dell released keyboard drivers that seemed to resolve.respect to anyone who can help me (and others) resolve this.hoping to hear from a dell support person soon - or anyone else who may help resolve. cheers.thanks @crimsom  - unfortunately the 1 year warranty ran out november 8, 2021. i will wait to hopefully hear from some generous forum members how may help resolve. i've spent dozens of hours already, and have reached the end of what i can do.thanks @crimsom - i followed all you steps, and it didn't work. uninstalled drivers, restarted, same drivers and # of hid keyboards found. i installed revo, uninstalled awcc and oc and did the advance scan. restarted each time, logged into admin account and installed as administrator. still same problem, with same # of hid keyboard devices. i'm at a total loss.sorry to hear about this.if you have already tried what i'm about to suggest, then i apologize for the inconvenience.the insight i will be providing will not fix your issue, but can help you understand whether this is a hardware or software issue.try loading into the alienware's bios (search up tutorials on google). when you are in the bios, try moving around within the bios using your arrow keys. if you can and the arrow keys select options within the bios, then it's a problem within your operating system. (software issue).if nothing happens when you click the arrow keys, then it probably is a hardware error, or something externally like usbs, power, etc. (hardware issue).if it's a software issue, contact dell or windows support (if you haven't tried both).if it's a hardware issue, contact dell support (if you haven't tried).if contacting these support teams for your issues have come to no avail, now you know that your issue is either a hardware/software issue, so you should primarily only research fixes for what type of issue you have. again, sorry that this may not help you fix your laptop and i hope this gets sorted sooner or later.thanks @ss374  and @crimsom . just to confirm i can boot to bios and use my keyboard arrow keys no problem. my keyboard only disconnects when i change alienfx from no rgb to a color. when i turn off rgb the keyboard connects again. i will try reinstalling os from suppoetassist and report back.@crimsom - i'd be willing to try this. i did successfully unplug the battery from the connector on the motherboard - would it be as similar/dangerous as that ?  can you describe why you feel that unplugging the cable might solve my problem?  i just spent another 2 hours, reinstalling the os twice to solve, both using dell supportassist. 1 using the os recover with assist option (~700mb, and 2 using the os recovery option (~9gb) - both images were created using the advanced option. same problem. the first os install, my machine boots up after the fresh install with the keyboard lit, and the keyboard not working. the only way i can get the keyboard working after the fresh installs, is to install awcc, choose 'no color' for the keyboard, save, and the hid keyboard device pops back in device manager, and i can use the keyboard. the 2nd install, the os boots up after fresh install with no keyboard lights, and keyboard working. as soon as i install awcc, add a color, the hid keyboard device dissapers in control panel. this is just nuts. and how is unplugging my keyboard cable gonna solve this ?  appreciate any help.reseating the rgb cable did not solve the problem\n",

      "content:  i have a brand new m15 r2, less than a month old. this has happened twice now. while playing red dead redemption ii, i received a low battery warning at 5% but then i noticed that my battery was plugged in and windows acknowledged that it was plugged in. the battery fell further to 3%. the laptop only took charge once i shut it down. this happened again a couple of days later after charging and discharging normally. what is the issue here? i'm considering sending this unit back because this is unacceptable for such a pricey machine. i don't know if this is an issue for others or not but i've seen similar post about alienware laptops from previous years' models.hi @redplague1986  welcome to this user to user discussion forum. this is not dell support. alienware m15 r2 laptop has hybrid power design which allows the system to maintain full performance under extreme heavy loading conditions. power is supplied by both the ac adapter and battery. prolonged extreme heavy loading will result in performance issues and/or battery drain while the ac adapter is connected. if laptop hybrid power design is not acceptable, consider getting a gaming desktop with large wattage power supply unit, that will play power hungry games for long durations. please click on kudos to say thank you for response from user that is not employed by dell. please share an update on progress, so that other users derive benefit from your experience. thank you. thank you for the information, it has helped to frame my conversation with dell support. i did not know about hybrid power design before your response. it appears that i have an issue that cannot be explained as expected behaviour, the documentation states:if and when the remaining battery capacity is lower than 20%, then hybrid power will be disabled to prevent further battery drop and potential system performance issues (stuttering/lagging/throttling) may be seen.in my case, no throttling occurs once at 20% and the and battery drain persists until critical.update on progress:battery discharging to critical levels while plugged in.it seems like my unit is faulty and i will now look into requesting a replacement, it's a brand new unit, not cheap either so i don't expect to be having such issues a couple of weeks in.i hope this helps others. i will post any further updates.thanks hello, did you solved this?i have exactly the same problem, i unplugged everything and still is not charging only remains at 6% is this a warranty problem?hi jcquim,yes, dell wouldn't replace the laptop even though i had just bought it. what they did however was send an engineer to my home. he replaced all components related to power supply. however after he left having fixed the power issue he had introduced a new issue stopping the ambient ring light from working. i had to open a new support ticket to have that fixed. so, if you get a service, make sure you check the machine throughly before the engineer leaves.\n",

      "content:  dear dell bios engineers/designers, please enable xmp profiles for the bios on the motherboards for the 2016 released alienware 17 r4 laptop. my purchased 1 year warranty expired on may 17, 2018. it is a gaming laptop and it should be able to use the xmp in order to give it more speed with the available ram on the market. i have seen that some other alienware rigs have this option within their alienware command center, and if this is an easier way to go about it then please do. thank you for your continued support of your expensive gaming systems.you can, but you shouldn’t.at least not on the stock ram that came with the laptop.get some real xmp ram, the ones that have a heatsink on the ram modules so heat conducts better. also add some thermal pads to improve heat conduction.i bought new crucial ballistix 32gb (2) 16gb sticks.here is a link to the exact product i received.https://www.newegg.com/ballistix-32gb-260-pin-ddr4-so-dimm/p/n82e16820164172?item=n82e16820164172i can confirm that these are rated at 2666mhz and that they have a heat sink attached to them. that is not the issue though. i can refute positively that you can not set an xmp profile within the most up to date bios related to the alienware m17r4 laptop. in the bios option for this pc there simply is no options for this.(but i am willing to be wrong, so if you know how to then please explain how, thanks.)have you tried xmping them yourself? try using intel extreme tuning utility to overclock it.if i am not mistaken, i think xmp needs to be turned on in bios before i am supposed to try overclocking and tuning my ram. so getting onto intel extreme utility and trying to overclock my ram which is set at the profile default of jedec and is not able to be changed to xmp setting is the problem here. i am not trying even to overclock my system or fine tune anything. i just want the expensive gaming laptop i purchased to run ram at the advertised setting of 2667mhz and to do that it has to be set into xmp mode within the bios.you can't overclock it using the bios. it's the bios itself that doesent allow overclocking.right - and that is the exact reason for this post. any gaming rig sold by any manufacturer has the option within the bios to set the ram to xmp profiles instead of the standard jedec profile.so this post is a request directly to dell and the people in their alienware department and who work on the bios to unlock the ram xmp profiles within the bios so that we can use our gaming rigs to their full potential.send a message to the community managers about this. check if they have anything.i have noticed that the xmp is missing in the alienware bios as well. did you ever get any feedback on this? yeh no xmp profile in the bios on my alienware area51m r2 either.my crucial ballistix 3200 mhz, ddr4 64gb (32gb x2) is stuck running @ 2666mhz with no options to overclock in awccdell inspiron 410 zino 8gb ram ocz trion 100 120gb ssd (win 10)alienware area-51m r2 (win 11)samsung galaxy note20 ultra 5gsamsung galaxy tab 7+\n",

      "content:  i am aware that this laptop, for reasons unknown, is not officially supported for windows 11. i can tell you that it will run just fine on windows 11. most of the upgrade windows did itself and the rest of the intel drivers came from intel and not dell. i can also tell you that the command center software available for my 17 r5 (windows 10) also works as of this time.my question is: why is this laptop not on the list for windows 11?hi @greeble101 welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. dell has not tested and does not provide drivers for alienware 17 r5 and does not support windows 11 on cassini (end of series) alienware 17 r5 because there is no alienware 17 r6. corporate dell has decided that there will be no further dell revision updates, system board (aka motherboard) design is just too old. alienware 17 r5 supports the windows 10, 64-bit operating system | dell us interesting that you state it is not supported for windows 11 as the dell support page for the m17 r5 lists the windows 11 drivers. that would seem to show that dell does indeed support that system as windows 11 compatible. however you posted about the m17 r5 but the picture you display is the 17 r5 which is not supported. so the question becomes which system do you have, the 17 r5 or the m17 r5 as they are not the same system.also can you post the exact type of cpu that is in your system. using that it is possible to track down the reason that the system is or is not on the microsoft list of compatible processors.the 17 r5 has an 8th gen intel cpu which should be supported but you also need tpm 2.0 and i am not sure if the 17 r5 has that feature in the bios and if not you should have ptt. but even with tpm 1.2 windows 11 would run fine though possibly not show as supported if you run the pc health app.indeed you are correct... mine is an 17 r5. it does have the tpm 2.0, it is an 8th gen, i7-8750h processor and i believe a 1060 gpu. in testing, the very first versions of windows 11 caused a shutdown hang but with later updates it was resolved. it is currently running win 11 22h2 with no problems. really the purpose of the post is to help others that have a similar laptop. being an mcse, i have long learned to check my specs against microsoft's and it is compatible. my question is why wouldn't dell also support it?\n",

      "content:  hello community!  so i had purchased a new usb circuit board for my 2019 alienware m17 r2 laptop because it has the wireless network card attached to it that i need to replace. unfortunately the card is factory soldered onto the board hence the reason i'm needing the whole usb circuit board. very easy to disassemble too. the one i purchased sadly wasn't the same part number as mine so i had to returned it for a refund with no time table when the right one would be available. no worries because the wireless card i'm replacing still worked, just wasn't getting the usual \"full\" wi-fi signal. i normally use ethernet so no big deal...so i carefully re-assembled the circuit board back inside my laptop, connected the wire that goes to the board, reinstalled the battery, reconnected the laptop battery to main motherboard, put back cover on then turned on laptop. from there i'm prompted to go into bios to set default settings again and after rebooting i was back in business. or so i thought. the wi-fi still works as it did before but neither of the two usb ports that are also attached to that circuit board work now...even after uninstalling/reinstalling all the usb drivers. so i have no idea why the ports are no longer working and i would really appreciate if anyone here in this very nice and helpful dell alienware community could help me fix this issue. i've also attached a picture of what the circuit board looks like as well. thank you all in advance for any solutions you may have in regards to this discussion. have a good day.  solved!go to solution.update: new usb circuit board finally arrived. after removing battery & doing flea power release then disconnecting cmos battery cable & repeating the power release again, i was able to uninstall the faulty circuit board then installed the new one. next i booted into bios to reset to optimal defaults then after a quick reboot, both of the usb ports on new circuit board are functioning properly once again.view solution in original posthi @ronster253 welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. the dell alienware m17 r2 alienware m17 r2 right side wlan card / usb ports io circuit board - killer 1650 is dp/n thcrt and it has white label on reverse of the circuit board. if the system board (aka motherboard) has not been damaged, reinstalling this circuit board to reseat the electrical connections may be sufficient. remember to power down laptop and wait for capacitors to fully discharge (flea power release) before working on these parts. hi @crimsom  thank you for your reply and suggestion. when i initially disassembled the circuit board in question, i had already done the steps you mentioned above and i also removed the battery as well (which one has to do to remove this particular circuit board) and did the flea power release a second time before continuing the board disassembly steps. just as a side note, my system board (motherboard) has never been damaged in any way and while working on or around the motherboard i always wear an anti-static wristband that is properly connected to a solid ground i installed in my work shop...and i only use screw drivers, etc. from a pc repair tool-kit i purchased this year. i will try the board  removal steps again but this time i'll disconnect the cmos battery and drain any power left over from that and then reinstall board, reset bios to optimal default settings and hope these two particular usb ports come back to life. because without them i'm unable to connect certain devices i use for online gaming as well as external hard drives i frequently use...and of course the all important external cooling pad (fans) that i definitely need to keep this particular alienware heat producing beast as cool as possible. in the meantime, any other suggestions for the issue i'm having will still be very much appreciated. thank you all and have a great day! hi @ronster253 thanks for sharing update. electrical potential differences kill electronic components. anti-static wristband and the electronic item being worked on must be at the same electrical potential. the local solid ground earth connected to water table is good for reducing a person's static charge having walked on house carpet and/or wearing inappropriate clothing when entering workshop. that is correct and duly noted. the solid ground i mentioned installing in my shop was done by a friend who builds residential houses from the \"ground up\" (pardon the pun) and he made sure to do mine by nec regulations as well so i'm good there. but thank you again for your wisdom and knowledge in regards to this topic. check usb ports or cables for physical damage.reset bios to factory defaults.run a hardware diagnostic test.check the usb device functionality on another computer.check windows device manager for errors.regards, johnhi @john harper  thanks for your recommendations. i've done all of those steps you mentioned multiple times lol.hopefully installing a whole new usb circuit board here in the near future will be the all-in-one solution to this problem. because i've literally tried pretty much everything else. glad this laptop fell into my hands at the low low price of free! so investing in a whole new board seams like a small price to pay compared to the huge headache it's already given me. lol. so, we shall see.update: new usb circuit board finally arrived. after removing battery & doing flea power release then disconnecting cmos battery cable & repeating the power release again, i was able to uninstall the faulty circuit board then installed the new one. next i booted into bios to reset to optimal defaults then after a quick reboot, both of the usb ports on new circuit board are functioning properly once again.\n",

      "content:  i did a proof of principle motherboard swap in r2 case.  my conclusions are:r2 is one of the easiest and least proprietary dell system to upgrade.there is virtually no limit to what atx motherboard you can use in this case.  as long as the board has usb2.0 9 pin header, it will work with fio to turn on all led in windows 10.  previous myth of only some board can work in this case is not correct.  you can use any board of old or new chipset and it will work.the easiest of all board swap is microatx board that has industry standard 9 pin fp, for which no additional cable or adapter is needed. the stock short usb1 and front panel cables work perfectly to reach new microatx board.both r2 and r5 cases have bios registry key in public domain to allow quick easy install of awcc on non-aw board. personally prefer awcc 4.0.59 to 4.8.25 for r2.so does this mean as long as i download awcc 4.059 to 4.8.25 i can control my alienware area 51 r2 rgb on any motherboard. as long as the board has usb2.0 9 pin header, it will work with fio to turn on all led in windows 10.  both r2 and r5 cases have bios registry key in public domain to allow quick easy install of awcc on non-aw board. personally prefer awcc 4.0.59 to 4.8.25 for r2.if you say so (no reason to doubt you).but windows-10 is the old windows. windows-11 has been out for over a year now. if buying a new motherboard, i'm pretty sure most would want to be able to run windows-11 on it (now or eventually).it's been my experience that aw-cc is limiting ... either on the versions you are allowed to run or the versions of windows they are compatible with.\n",

      "content:  what would be the easiest way to upgrade my r2 5960x to a window's 11 machine?thank youmitchjust install windows 11 after bypass cpu tpm and secure boot check steps.you cannot do an update to windows 11 as you have a 5th generation cpu and to comply with the ms supported cpu list you must have at least an 8th gen cpu (except for 2 specific 7th gen cpus). so you need to do an unsupported hardware installation using the media creation tool from the windows 11 page here. this page at howtogeek may help, this page at the ms forum, and this video at youtube as well.keep in mind that ms has been warning that down the road they will no longer offer updates for windows 11 installed on unsupported hardware. but that warning came long ago and has yet to be implemented. still one day ms could prevent windows 11 from working on those systems. also windows 12 is in development and will be released around the time that windows 10 support ends, with no hints as to system requirements or whether there will be stringent system requirements.edit: @redxps630 is spot on as well and also types faster and with far more brevity than this old guy.thank you both.this brings me to the question i really want to ask: what would be the easiest and best way to upgrade to a later supported cpu?thank youbest way is to upgrade to intel 8th or higher gen cpu such as i7-8700, i7-9700, or i9-9900.  if you want better future proof upgrade to 10th or 12th gen.easiest way is to upgrade motherboard to z370m micro atx from msi or gigabyte for 8th gen cpu. get whichever one that is least expensive, preferably new w warranty.you also need lga1151 cooler and ddr4 memory for 300 series motherboard.in all honestly by the time you are done upgrading the price will come close to new.i would make a list with prices, and compare against the price of a complete new machine. see what the difference is. thank you both.this brings me to the question i really want to ask: what would be the easiest and best way to upgrade to a later supported cpu?thank youlong range ... you need a \"current\" system that runs windows-11 without any compromises or hacks.buy or build a new system. pull a few parts from it if you must (but not advised since they are \"old and out-dated\" also).leave area51-r2 as is (running windows-10) and move to less demanding role (or sell/gift-away). it's still relevant, just not for your current use-case.points all well taken. thank you.for reference, i also have an r5-9980 xe.is there any mb that will be a drop in - minimal/no cable repining, theater lights working, oc/thermal control software will work?thank you i think you mean i9-9980xe which is an x series intel cpu socket lga2066 x299 chipset.you can get a dell area 51 r5 motherboard for that cpu.   r4 motherboard does not have bios update to support 9th gen x series cpu.if the dell oem board is too expensive then get a msi or ga x299 atx motherboard.i meant for reference my other area 51 is an r5 i9-9980xe.would an r5 main board swap on my r2 be a drop in? \n",

mistake the menu button for the power button. suffice to say, when the power button doesn't work, the menu button doesn't either.the occurrence is random, and not related to the pixel refresh cycle. i know that is happening when i see a breathing green light, though the pixel refresh appears to happen quite often and with what seems a greater frequency than 4 hours use time. i've seen the pixel refresh happen 2 times in a row within 20 minutes of each other and the first was allowed to complete before i used the aw3423dw again.when the aw3423dw doesn't wake, sometimes the power light will be on purple (which is the color i set it to while on), sometimes the power light will be off (which i set it to when the aw3423dw is off), and sometimes it will just be stuck a random color, of which i have seen pink or teal. when any of these is happening, the power button is unresponsive. no amount of pressing it will make the aw3423dw turn back on. i have tried holding it for quite a while with no result. moving my mouse or hitting a key will not wake it. the only way to get it to work again is to unplug, wait, plug back in.i had a similar issue with my last monitor, a dell s3220dgf. that monitor also would go into sleep mode, but the backlight would stay on displaying a black screen which is very possibly what's happening with the aw3423dw, there's just no backlight so the screen appears black but is still on. no amount of messing with the power button would wake it. i would need to unplug it then plug it back in and it would work fine. the occurrence was random with that monitor as well.i have tried updating power settings in both the command center, as well as in windows. i have tried updating my drivers using the ones on the dell website as well as letting windows find what it believes is the best driver. i have tried different ports on my video card. i am using the supplied displayport cable that came with the aw3423dw plugged into an evga 3080 ftw3 and my aw3423dw firmware is m0b102. i do not believe the video card is the issue as i've had the same issue on an evga 1080ti sc2. i am currently using windows 11 but the issue happened using windows 10 as well.any help on this would be appreciated. i am worried this issue will get worse until it just no longer turns back on.easy questions first.  what driver are you using for the monitor.  i have 1.1.0.0 (3/14/2022) but windows keeps trying to install 1.0.0.0.i have never needed to plug or unplug my monitor as you seem to need.  i am in just about the same situation as you regarding the monitor.  using the dp input @ 120 hz, rtx 3090.my monitor goes low power when the video display is lost.  the light blinks white.  when the computer wakes up the light goes through the color changes but is not doing a pixel refresh.  it returns to steady blue while on.there are three configurations where i do the pixel refresh.  first, during the pop-up message i push the joystick and the monitor turns black and goes through the refresh and leaves the monitor off when finished.i also put the computer to sleep or shut it down and about 2 minutes later the pixel refresh starts.  after the same 6-7 minutes, the monitor returns to standby with the blinking white light.when the computer comes back up, the light goes through the multiple colors on the button.i am currently using the 1.1.0.0 driver but i have tried both. windows has never tried to install the older driver, i manually installed it to see if it would fix the issue. plus i have no idea what the dell driver download tries to install. when i run the exe, nothing changes in the properties screen so i don't really know if it's doing anything. it just stays as whatever driver i had installed at the time. i've also tried browsing to the folder the zip file created but there doesn't appear to be any actual driver there.like you mentioned, when the monitor wakes normally the rear lights and the power button go through several colors before turning purple (which is what i have it set to.) i have actually never once seen a popup saying it was going to do a pixel refresh, and i have confirmed in my settings that the auto warning message is set to on. the only way i know it's happening is when the power light turns green while the monitor screen is black. i have never tried doing a manual pixel refresh. i also set eco mode to off to see if that would alleviate the issue but it didn't.i originally had the refresh rate set at 175hz, but have since changed it to 144hz to see if that would change anything but that did not. i can't imagine what refresh rate would have to do with anything, but hey, it doesn't hurt to try.being as i don't have any other issues (loud fan, stuck or dead pixels, scratched screen) i don't really want to give up my monitor in the chance i'll get one back that's worse off. maybe i should try to reset to factory defaults and see if that does anything.verify that the monitor is plugged into the machine.unplug the vga cable.hold the 2nd and 4th buttons (counting from left to right). these are the + and < keys.unplug the power cord.while holding the + and < keys, plug in the power cord and continue to hold the keys until there is a solid green light. (the light will be green for approximately only three seconds and then will turn orange.)plug in the vga and attach the monitor again. hope this helps you out,johnthanks for the help. but the aw3423dw only has 2 buttons, the power button and the menu joystick. i cannot try what you suggested.the aw3423dw goes into standby, then i cannot wake it unless i unplug it, let it sit for a few seconds, then plug it back in.i had a similar issue with my last monitor, a dell s3220dgf. that monitor also would go into sleep mode, but the backlight would stay on displaying a black screen turns back on.while not only is your problem unusual, it's off-the-scale rare to have two separate monitors doing rare abnormal things.personally, i would be checking the computer and/or cables right about now.you can also troubleshoot monitors by connecting them to a different (known working) computer and see where the problems follow.i agree it is definitely a strange issue. i can say i've tried different cables, both dp and hdmi, 2 different video cards, and 2 different os' with a fresh install of each. the msi monitor which is also connected has never once had this issue, and that has been connected for several years at this point. as you said it would be very unlucky to have 2 monitors having the same issue, but the 2 having the issue are both made by dell. i will continue to troubleshoot on my end, as last night i uninstalled the alienware command center (which for some reason was not a very easy process) as well as reset the monitor to factory defaults and have not had the issue occur again. i appreciate the feedback and can only hope this fixed the issue. hey i am having the same issue mine is about 2 months old was working amazingly then one day i came home from work turn on my pc and nothing. ive done everything i unplug it i changed all the cables. the lights will turn on but i get no picture at all so i had to call dell and have them send me a replacement the screen just completely died out of no wherei am having the exact same issue: monitor is dark and nonresponsive, no input from the machine does anything, though the machine is on and working (and you can hear that it is in fact functional and accepting input as normal), and the monitor power button is lit --  sometimes white, sometimes a random color. the only way to get the monitor panel to come back on is to unplug the machine and plug it back in. pressing and holding the power button or joystick do nothing.latest drivers; display port to the pc; monitor power plugged direct into the wall.this happens a few times a day to me now. i'm going to have to rma the monitor, which is too bad since it's a nice panel.my brother in law has the same problem with his aw3420dw.the monitor is not tuning back on after the pc (falienware aurora r13  iirc) wakes from hybernate.connected via dp to a radeon 6900 xt iirc.my brother in law is really upset about it since he has little time to fix such issues because he works a lot an thought he could spent some quality time by buying an overly expensive aw... but aw  has been a disabpointment.\n",

      "content:  hello, i have received my aurora r15 with the rtx 4090. i have had this stuttering issue since the beginning. around 5-10 minutes in each game, i get this weird stuttering that drops frames and distorts the audio for about 1-2 seconds. it doesn't matter which game it is, it happens. things that i have tried: * updated graphics drivers from geforce * rolled back drivers from geforce to 3 different versions and it still happens* updated windows* updated all drivers with a driver updater app* turned on game mode in settings * set power management to performance mode and normal mode through nvidia control panel* turned off v-sync in nvidia control panel*set performance mode in acc*updated bios and firmwareand today there was a firmware update for alienware i also installed and applied and nothing has changedthis issue is getting very annoying. i do not believe it is a hardware issue, but a software issue. but i could be wrong. at this point i am stumped. the last thing i could think of that i have not tried was a full system reset, wipe and redownload everything. but i am trying to avoid that.i do have some corsair dominator ddr5 6000mhz ram coming in the mail in a couple days and i will be upgrading it from the 4800mhz. but i'm pretty sure that's not the issue either but i could be wrong as well. if anyone else has had experience with this issue please comment. i would really love to get this figured out. this was an expensive machine which i am enjoying for the most part and really don't regret the purchase. and i also understand that there could be bugs at the beginning of an initial launch of a new product as well. but for the price tag, it should be a little more stable out of the box rtx 4090 13th gen intel  i9-13900kf32gb ddr5 ram 4800mhzsolved!go to solution.check my post below.the title is aurora r15, issues so farview solution in original postcheck my post below.the title is aurora r15, issues so fartry uninstalling support assistant. on my r7 and r13 that solved the issue on both machines. i know others on here have had the same issue and fixed it the same way. the r15 is not that different to an r13.uninstall all dell/alienware software software and see if that solves the issue. lots of posts on this forum with awcc, support assist software causing issues.then reinstall 1 by 1 until the issue appears again. thank you! just tried this! fingers crossed. have been playing some games for a couple hours and no stutters!!!  i think that worked! fingers crossed. no issues so far in a couple hours worth of gaming =] i have learnt with my r13 my machine runs better when i set the lights, remove the awcc and then uninstall dell's software that i am never going to use. i also try not to use dells drivers. for example i use nvidia's drivers for my graphics card.enjoy your new pc.i’m having exactly this same issue that you described, every 10 or 15 minutes or so. not even when just running games, even just at merely being on the desktop and playing music or chatting on discord or something. i’ve tried uninstalling support assist, alienware command center, every single thing that says alienware in programs, but still the problem is persisting. i’m glad that it’s not just me, but it’s kind of atrocious if this is an endemic issue to a whole line of brand new 5k~ machines. dell, please help!well, i take it back! i had thought that i’d uninstalled support assist, but i guess i either didn’t complete the process, or maybe awcc put it back (which i have now uninstalled as well). in any case, i noticed that support assist was still there this morning, so i uninstalled it one more time. it’s been a whole day now, it remains uninstalled, and more importantly, there has not been a single instance of the stuttering since then. so, the fix works! very very thankful for this!glad that works for you as well.. ! cheers!\n",

      "content:  basically i am an advanced video editor i grabbed the aurora r11 a couple years ago with the 2080 super installed and have just capped out on my capabilities as a video editor working on visual effects. without upgrading my pc completely ( as i am currently running a i9 processor ,64gb ram ,8tb storage with a rtx 2080 super 8gb.) i am looking and ready to upgrade just not sure what will fit inside. i have looked at the size of the 4090 in mm and it seems much bigger than my current 2080. i've read some things on reddit that maybe a fan upgrade would save some space but how would i know what will really fit? my guess is just trial and error? i hope it is possible but the 3090 will have to due worst case. if anyone has any tips or suggestions that would be very helpful. thanks so much. the 3090 was geared towards production while the 4090 was designed for gamers. so if you are primarily using it for productivity, the 3090 is the better choice as it will be cheaper. the 4090 will not fit in the r11. that is a massive card both in length and width, it now takes up 3 slots.your max graphics card length is 267mm (10.5\") without case modification. the nvidia rtx 3080ti founders edition (285mm) will fit if you replace the lower front fan and bracket with a 15mm fan (no bracket). the rtx 3090 founders edition is 313mm long, so you would need to cut a hole in the chassis and hang about 15mm of graphics card outside. any 3000 series graphics card will be much smaller on a water block. if you are able to find a dell oem 3090 . . . of course that would fit.\n",

      "content:  i bought an aurora r12 last year and it brought me nothing but stress and anger. i paid 2300$ for a premium gaming machine with a new rtx 3000 card so u would think that u would be able to game and enjoy  ur new pc with no issues for atleast the next 5 year huh ? .... well think again today is jan 1st 2023 an  i still havent been able to sit and play a game or use this pc once like its supposed to be everyday i look at it and cry and feel like smashing it . when i first ordered it  there was an issue with the order so after contacting support we came to a agreement that the pc i had ordered will be returned once i receive it and instead i will receive the same pc (same specs and about 50$ difference in the price ) but with liquid cooling instead of the cheap fan because i had realised it comes with a cheap fan and has no heatsink , but somehow the order with the aoi cooling got canceled without my permission after i had already order it .so now im stuck with a pc that has issues . since that day ive been contacting dell everyday whether its by chat,phone,whatsapp texting,emails only to hear excuses or sometimes they ignore my emails and text ,when i call i keep having to repeat myself and they keep transfering me to wrong departements and the people on the other end of the call are from foreign countries and can never do anything other than transferring me , paid 400+ extra trying to fix it myself (aftermarket coolers, heatsinks or parts from ebay ) but im not good at these things and dont know how to . they just kept ignoring me till my warranty expired and after it did they suddenly respond quickly to remind me im not under warranty . this is unacceptable i just want to enjoy the pc i paid for .this was my first one and i paid more than i should and put my trust in a 'premium brand'  only to be let down bad.solved!go to solution.. . . to be clear; the blue thermal pad stays on the heatsink; the plastic protective strip is pealed off prior to installationview solution in original postthe blue thermal pads stay on. there is a part without thermal pads because that part does not contact any voltage regulators . . . it sits above the motherboard for extra heat dissipation. there should be a clear plastic protective strip over the blue thermal pads that gets peeled off prior to installation. see the photo below where the clear plastic strip is beginning to peel off in the corner.(click photo to embiggen)view solution in original postit would likely help if you explain what is not working properly, so we can try and make it work like it should. the cooling is not able to keep up with the pc , it once smoked and i sent a video to dell and they did nothing, cant play games sounds like it gonna explode on idle , i also had something leak on my finger from the processor, the whole thing is unacceptable ive been wanting to dispose of it but need it for work , so sometimes i still turn it on quickly for a couple minutes for emails and stuff . the only thing i was offered was for someone to come and change the cheap fan for another used cheap fan after i showed them a code the pc showed on the screen about a issue it has wich is unacceptable if they want to change something they should change the pc not the cheap fan that was supposed to be a liquid cooler in the first place.what are you rig components (cpu, graphics card, psu wattage, ram)? did you say you installed 3rd party liquid cooling? if not, are you interested in trying?i havent installed anything but i bought a corsair h60 120 and the official alienware aoi r12 liquid cooler even bought the vrm heatsinks all separate , i paid all this extra money and they wouldnt even send a technician to install them to see if it works at this point i just want my money back . we can't assist with getting money back. you would have to contact a dell agent for that.this is a user forum . . . so you won't get your money back here. however, if you need some help installing the aio liquid cooler and heatsinks, maybe an extra fan or two, just let us know.when intalling the l shaped vrm heatsink do i remove the bluepadding it comes with on the copper part or is it some thermal stuff ive seen people leave it on there and some remove it ?if you are referring to blue plastic tape on the heatsink that lays on top of the thermal pad strip, then yes it's okay to remove that. it is there to protect the thermal pad from getting dirty or damaged. it comes off real easy. you can remove it prior to putting the heatsink over the vrm.\n",

      "content:  hello,i am of the mind that a clean install of an operating system always performs better than an upgraded one.  when i bought my current alienware aurora ryzen r10 it came with windows 10.  since i've upgraded to windows 11, and some things behave a little wonky.   some things i have been able to fix on my own, some things i have not.regardless, my belief that a clean install is better than an upgraded one stands and i want to redo my image as a clean install of windows 11.  that being said, i still want complete access to all the features and software that came packaged with this alienware.while i understand i cannot run the support assist recovery assistant in order to redo the image without having to go back to windows 10, what i'm hoping is there is a way to simply install windows 11 on my boot drive, then install the specific additional dell/alienware software that will allow me to use all the features that came with the computer.what is the best method to go about doing this.  is there something i can download that would have the package of specific software that was included with my alienware?if not a specific software package that includes all of that (and i'm not talking digital delivery, more like the killer software, the aliemnware command center, alienware support assist, etc). what is the best method of getting the software i want to install post windows 11 installation, and is there a particular order i should install it in?if my question shows that while my end goal of having a windows 11 install with the software that came along with my alienware is attainable, but my supposed methodology is incorrect as to how i think i have to go about making it happen, please let me know.  also, let me know what the right way of going about getting my end goal met.i just don't want to hurt my machine.  i don't mean physically, but i just want my computer to still have access to the other partitions that dell lays down on the boot drive for all the other stuff including (should i want) being able to go back and reimage my computer back to windows 10.i hope this was clear and understandable. thanks for reading, and i look forward to seeing your advice. just make bootable usb installation media using the windows 11media creation tool from microsoft: windows 11 than download all oem software for your r10 from dell: dell drivers  pending on your licensing you might not be able to activate the windows 11 installation.  i went ahead and used the media creation tool to make the windows 11 install usb,  and installed windows 11 successfully.prior to that i had downloaded all the drivers for my system.  i had no problem installing them.all the associated software (including software that controls the hardware) that is part of my alienware system installed perfectly; save one.   the alienware command center initially installed, but when i ran it, i had no ability to access my rgb controls, fan, cpu, video card, memory, to configure as i saw fit.  i then noticed in the upper pane in a message stating that an update was required.  so i clicked that message and it started the update.after it downloaded the update it began running the \"installshield wizard for alienware command center package manager\" and immediately errors started popping up.  from what i could gather, the installer would come to some part of the program that it needed to download before it could install that component. either that, or the installer wanted to be able to ping a server for some reason.  regardless, i would get an error message stating it could not connect to the internet.  there is nothing wrong with my internet connection.  i am on this computer now using my internet connection in order to access this webpage that allows me to comse this message and log it via the internet.  i'm not sure what could be happening.   when the error occurs, it gives me the option to try again, or cancel.  trying again doesn't work.  when i hit cancel, it appears to try to download, ping or whatever then next aspect of the program it needs to install.  again i get the message stating it cannot connect to the internet.   trying again doesn't work, so i must again cancel, and this loop of new item after new item that needs to be installed goes on to the point where i have to end the process lest i die of old age.so i'm not sure how i'm to go about installing this very necessary program.any ideas?1. i went ahead and used the media creation tool to make the windows 11 install usb,  and installed windows 11 successfully.2. prior to that i had downloaded all the drivers for my system.  i had no problem installing them.3. all the associated software (including software that controls the hardware) that is part of my alienware system installed perfectly; save one.   the alienware command center initially installed,1. good2. no \"dell programs\" or \"dell drivers\" are required for windows-11 to run properly. windows-update will give you everything you need. you can get your video-driver directly from nvidia.com or amd.com .3. except this one (aw-cc to control lights and fans).uninstall it, reboot and cleanly install it (the latest version validated to run on aurora-r10). turn-off it's updating ability. run computer, reboot a few times ... and see if it starts working.if you continue to have problems, post what file/version of aw-cc you are trying to install.awcc is a problem child. several users have reported issues with it...for awcc issues you can try disabling windows core isolation. it's under windows security - device security.it's a newer feature of windows 11 that has caused some issues for other users.on my r10 awcc installs itself as a windows application in the directory (program files > windowsapps).i always use the revo uninstaller program to get rid of the bad awcc version problems.once done, download and run the full installer on the dell website, i never update from the awcc program.make sure you have the latest updates from the windows store, best would be to login your m$ account.be aware that the some anti-virus program, firewall might block you from full install. in this case i always pause until the installation is finished.awcc is still a bad boy : my current problem is that it loses ( from time to time) the  cpu, memory sensors reading, only the gpu is visible, but does not seem to cause actual problems on the fans speeds etc..i simply reboot to solve that problem,\n",

      "content:  i've had the aw3423dw since september now, and generally quite like it. i've read all of the messages here regarding the pixel refresh warning, and i have to say, it is much more frustrating than a $1800 after tax monitor should be. does it know what it's doing at all?  i use this aw3423dw for gaming, and as an alternate monitor for work. so it's on probably 10 - 12 hours a day. with most of that being boring office stuff that's relatively static on screen. i have the 102 firmware. i get the pixel refresh warning every 4 hours, which always seems to come up when it's inconvenient during the day, but that's not a big deal really. i usually confirm that i get the green light when i turn the aw3423dw off to confirm that the pixel refresh is working.this is where the two problems come in:1. i can't turn that message off. at least, the way the osd is written, leads me to think that i can't. when i turn the *message* off through the osd, and go back, the menu will now say that pixel maintenance on the aw3423dw is turned off. i'd expect pixel maintenance to be on, and the message to be off. so i turn the message back on, and now pixel maintenance is back to being on. with how i'm using this aw3423dw, pixel maintenance is important, so i'm not fussing with that one.2. with pixel maintenance on, it seems like the monitor has no clue that is has run before. about 3/4 of the time when i start it up in the morning for work, i'll get the pixel maintenance prompt (sometimes, the panel refresh comes up too).  the aw3423dw has been off for 12 hours or so, and when i turned it off, i confirmed the blinking green light was there.  why would the pixel refresh need to run when it was off? i'm guessing there's some lazy firmware in there that just looks at time elapsed and pops up the message whenever time elapsed > 4 hours. it's frankly dumb. this is the part where being able to upgrade firmware would be handy, but i see where that's gotten on the forums.is this aw3423dw functioning as it should? it seems wrong. but then it could be right, but just poorly written firmware.  in the end, if the pixel/panel refresh are working correctly, that's the most important thing. but a monitor this costly shouldn't have issues like this.i have the dwf version of this monitor, and i have 3 options in the osd menu for pixel refresh warning something along the lines of:- run right now.- run when the monitor is in sleep mode.- run when the monitor is in sleep mode and turn this message off. the panel health on the main osd menu should tell you when it's ready to run. should show green, yellow and red dot for panel health indication.that seems way better!on the version i have, there's an oled panel maintenance option in the osd, and in that there is:the first two start the respective refresh right away, the last is an on/off switch that i refer to above. no panel health indicator at all.oh, interesting. i thought the mb102 firmware fixed that issue on that model.\n",

      "content:  good day everyone.i bought sometime ago and alienware r10 ryzen edition knowing that the motherboard is bricked from the previous owner as he did the attempt on updating the bios, but somewhere along the way, it failed. i will attempt to flash it back to the factory setting explained on this site, but in the mean time.if all fails, i will swap the motherboard.here is the big question to all of you out there. there was a youtube channel out there that claimed that if you take the original motherboard off the case, it will brick the board. not sure if he was talking about the newer model, or if it is also applicable on the r10 models. could anyone confirm this?would love to revive that tower as i took it all apart \"exception of the motherboard\", cleaned it all up, more parts are coming for it such as a better cooling fans for the tower as i have heard that the cooling fans on those machines aren't the greatest. thinking on upgrading the cpu to a ryzen 9 3900x or xt \"or if you know of a better one? let me know\", more rams and ssd disk as i forgot to mention that the previous owner took all the parts out of the tower like cpu, ram, gpu and storage device. so i am left only with a tower with a bricked motherboard, but the tower is in mint condition.hope to hear from all of you.thank youtaking out the motherboard does not brick the motherboard. there are 2 versions of the r10 motherboard: 1 that only supports ryzen 3000 cpu's, 1 that only supports ryzen 5000 cpu's.bios recovery on these board is not that great, so you might not be able to recover from a bad bios flash.it's also possible something else happened to the motherboard and that is why the previous owner got rid of it...the previous owner never bothered trying to fix it once it was bricked \"according to what he said\"on my end, i did replace the bios battery as it was dead, did the \"bios clr\" jumper was jumped. now i am waiting for parts to come in to revive the tower. since it has not cpu nor any ram, i was wondering what would the greatest cpu for this machine? as i mentioned, i am hoping to upgrade the cpu to a ryzen 9 3900 x or xt as i am hoping to play eve online to it's highest settings. but if this mobo can't handle it, i might stick with the ryzen 7 cpu and not sure which one would be the greatest cpuanother motherboard with other parts are also coming for this tower.cpu support depends on the motherboard revision.ammts-sh.   rev:a00validated oem cpu =aurora r10 motherboard nwn7m pegatron 69m10ht00b01 released on december 9, 2019 is supported by dell with these oem cpu =* hxpr2 amd r5-3500, 6c, 65wv7jdd amd r5-3600, 6c, 65w2hcv8 amd r5-3600x, 6c, 95wvf3fd amd r5-3600xt, 6c, 95wxnkfv amd r7-3700x, 8c, 65w4gx0g amd r7-3800x, 8c, 105wvj84g amd r7-3800xt, 8c, 105wchmwg amd r9-3900, 12c, 65w6kjc4 amd r9-3900x, 12c, 105w2f53d amd r9-3900xt, 12c, 105w1mhh5 amd r9-3950x, 16c, 105waurora r10 motherboard tyr0x pegatron 69m10ht20a01 released on january 11, 2021 is supported by dell with these oem cpu =* hxpr2 amd r5-3500, 6c, 65wvvdnw amd r5-5600x, 6c, 65wntmxc amd r7-5800, 8c, 65wp0m7x amd r7-5800x, 8c, 105wmcw0t amd r9-5900, 12c, 65wkgkw8 amd r9-5900x, 12c, 105wmmx5c amd r9-5950x, 16c, 105w\n",

      "content:  since the launch of the wow (world of warcraft) dragonflight expansion, i've been having endless audio issues with my aurora r11. at first i thought it might be game related, but it's looking more and more like it's hardware related. i'll be playing wow and using discord, and the audio will cut out, start to stutter, then completely go away. eventually it might return, but no other audio will work on my aurora r11, including discord and spotify, until i open up the task manager, find \"windows audio device graph isolation\" and force close it. then the audio returns. i then have to close out any other audio using applications and restart them before audio works for them also. this happens 20-30 times a week now. i've been running cpuid hwmonitor and found that when the audio starts to stutter and cut out, it correlates to the core temperatures, some of them, hitting 100°c.try see here: graph isolation 1. make sure you're using the latest realtek high definition audio driver version 6.0.9394.1, a01 released on october 12, 2022.2. if you're already using the latest driver, try the following:-open device manager, under sound, video and game controllers, right click realtek audio.-select update driver.-click on browse my computer for drivers.-let me pick from a list of drivers available on my computer, then uncheck 'show compatible hardware'.-choose microsoft as the manufacturer, and select high definition audio device version 10.0.22621.608.-click next. let it install the driver and restart the pc.still happening, actually more frequently than when i posted this.what are you rig components; cpu, graphics card, ram, psu, cpu cooling solution?i9-10900, rtx 3090, 32gb@3200, liquid cooling, not sure on the psu?i've noticed over the last few days though that the problem only happens when i'm using discord as well  even in the air flow stifled aurora r11 a 65 watt cpu that is liquid cooled should not be hitting 100c. why are you using cupid hwmonitor to check your temps and not awcc?  at what % are your fans running @ 100c? have you tried configuring a more aggressive fan curve. i notice you are not complaining about screaming case fans.\n",

      "content:  intro: i have an essentially brand new pc, ordered in may, received in june, and used for the first time in july. i use a radeon rx 6800 xt graphics card. i am running windows 11 and am up to date on all updates as of the afternoon of august 16th. this was a problem i encountered day 1 of usage, that i successfully avoided until now.context: the problem occurs so far exclusively after the pc has entered a sleep state, which has only ever happened twice. the first time was on the first day i used it, when i let it go to sleep by itself. the second time was today, after intentionally putting it into sleep mode out of old habit. after the first time this occurred and have since disabled the auto-sleep function. i turn it off after use every single day. the first time the problem happened, i got frustrated trying to fix it and went to bed. when i woke up, i turned it on to continue trying to fix the problem only for it to have seemingly fixed itself.the problem: when the pc is woken up from sleep mode, it is no longer able to register my monitor's hdmi input. my monitor simply provides the \"input not supported\" message. my primary monitor is an equally new acer. i also have a samsung 2015 hd tv that can be used as a very low quality monitor (i have used it with this pc successfully before). changing which monitor i use does not solve this problem. i also have two different hdmi cables, an older one and a brand new one i got with the new acer monitor. when the pc turns on i can successfully use the keyboard, key backlight turns on and i can toggle caps lock.failed solutions: switching the hdmi cable and/or monitor does not solve this problem. i have tried blowing out any dust from the pc's hdmi port, both of my monitor's hdmi ports, and all four of my two cables' hdmi plugs. i do not have any other valid cable/port combinations for the pc and either of my monitors (which have support for vga which the pc does not support, and av but the only av cable i own is for a ps1). on direction of an alienware support rep i have opened up the cover, removed and put back that the graphics card and this had no effect on the problem. i have tried using fn+8 as well as windows+shift+ctrl+b.request: please give me literally any advice at all on how to solve this problem, or any idea why this has only occurred after putting my pc into sleep mode. please do not ask me to do anything that involves clicking. i can use the keyboard and login/navigate menus and such but as i cannot achieve any display, using the mouse to click on anything is not a feat i am capable of achieving.when this happens try turning power to the monitor on/off and see if it comes back on.my r14 has an issue where none of the display ports work. at least my hdmi works otherwise it would be an expensive paperweight. currently dell has no solution for my pc. i hope they did with yours.they did not. replaced graphics card and had same issue, then replaced motherboard and had same issue. i've decided to strip it for parts and buy a new and cheaper computer instead with some of the parts out of the r14. hope you figure something out with yours.i have the exact same problem. when the r14, purchased in november, wakes from sleep or hibernate, 7 times out of ten the monitor will not recognize the hdmi input. i sometimes can hit the input button on the monitor multiple times, while shaking the mouse clicking the space and it will bring the computer display  up....this is a roll of the dice  each time. mostly it won't work and i have to reboot the computer.i have not found any replies yet to this problem that shows up here and on reddit. i have a new monitor, 4k, new computer, new hdmi cables. is there any damage to the computer to simply leave it on for 14 hours --i use it for work, turn the monitor off and then at the end of the day just power it off. i don't like leaving a computer on for that many hours daily but this routine of having to reboot to make it work is awful.\n",

technician stated that it must be a hardware problem and needs to be brought in for out of warranty service. should i just wait for the next bios update and try to install that? any other solutions available?i think some user found r8 power button stopped working after bios update. so your trouble now of updating bios may be a blessing in disguise.  no need to update bios unless absolutely needed to.that's more than likely because the usb file system is fat32 instead of ntfs. i would suggest formatting it to ntfs format, and then follow the procedure below. formatting it means all information on the usb drive will be lost, so ensure you have any important files backed up.i don't think there's a hardware issue with your r8.updating the bios from bios boot menu (independent of operating system)note 1: before updating the bios, ensure that you suspend bitlocker encryption on a bitlocker-enabled system. if bitlocker is not enabled on your system, you can ignore this step. for information about how to disable bitlocker, see how to enable or disable bitlocker with tpm in windows at support.dell.com.note 2: do not turn off the power or interrupt the bios update process during the update.note 3: your system requires a restart after installing the bios. the restart can be deferred but must be completed to ensure that the update is installed.installation1. copy the downloaded file to a usb drive. the usb drive does not need to be bootable device.2. insert the usb drive into any usb port.3. power on the system.4. at the dell logo screen, press f12 to access the one-time boot menu.5. select bios flash update in the other options section.6. click the ... button to browse the usb drive to locate the downloaded file.7. select the file and click ok.8. verify the existing system bios information and the bios update information.9. click begin flash update.10. review the warning message and click yes to proceed with the update.the system restarts and displays a progress during bios update. the system restarts again when the update is complete.i'm also having the same issue, was prompted to update my bios today and can't do so. i had memory integrity on and was greeted by a scary noise and the first image below. next, i turned it off and tried updating it manually through both supportassist and the dell website but i got an error as well. apparently windows update will automatically update critical bios version for you unless you edit group policy to disable bios update in windows update.  perhaps just sit n wait and hope the next windows update will do everything smoothly for you without issues.that error typically means your bios version is too far behind to go straight to the version you are attempting to update.open alienware update and click on system information to determine your current bios version.  dell has a very foolish numbering schema where 1.0.3 is older than 1.0.25 (considered rev. 25 vs. rev. 3 for version 1.0).go here: https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-ca/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=3hcx2&oscode=wt64a&productco...then expand \"other available versions\"find your current version, and then download all the versions after your currently installed version.install them one by one, and you will be able to complete all updates.  remember to follow the guidelines (i.e. turn off bitlocker, etc.)  hi all,i had a problem with bios 1.0.25 installing via alienware update, but iirc i did manage to get it to work by placing the bios image on a flash drive and updating via f12. i couldn't get that to work with 1.0.26 however. the flash drives were never recognised, as with the op.in the end, what did work for me was to :note, now that i'm writing it, since windows pe had access to all my discs, copying the bios update executable to the flash drive wasn't strictly necessary, but it made it easier to find. depending on your comfort with the command line, you could skip this.hope this helps someone.cheers,kieran ps: i did try @vanadiel suggestion wrt to the file system on the flash drive, when i was attempting to update using the bios image, but neither fat32 nor ntfs allowed it to be recognised. in fact the only disk it saw was my internal m.2 ssd. i also have a sata ssd and an external usb that were similarly ignored. \n",

      "content:  hello.i ordered a specific alienware aurora r13 (amd radeon rx 6800 xt, i7-12700kf) with a big amount off over the black friday sales.  by all accounts, it was a huge seller.  it had a specific setup that we couldn't change, and so i'm assuming that most people who got my same setup are dealing with my same issue.  after a week of headaches, i found a fix, and wanted to share it here where a lot of people will come looking to see if they can find the answer.the issue: after sleep, hibernation, a long period idle or even turning off the monitor a bit, the video won't come back on.  the monitor will say it's not getting any signal.  no amount of power setting twiddling, updates, make any difference.  this is on amd video graphic cards only.the cause:  this is related to a ridiculous little hidden amd \"feature\" called ultra low power setting.  if you're idle a time or if your gpu detects your monitor is off, it goes into the ultra low power setting, and for whatever reason, it doesn't kick itself back out of it on many setups.  your pc will still be on, you can even press buttons and hear things going in the background, like video if you had it on pause, you can hear it playing and everything else on your pc will still be working and on, just the video card doesn't send any video to your monitor and nothing you do or press kicks you out of this mode.instructions for fixing it:1) click start - type regedit.exe, right click on it and select to run as administrator.2) back up your registry in case you make a mistake.  click on file, then export, and save a copy of the registry somewhere.3) in the registry editor, press f3 and type enableulps, hit enter.4) it probably will find this as the first search entry in a sub folder 0000.  make sure the value is only \"enableulps\" and nothing more (not enableulps_na).5) double click the registry entry for enableulps and change value from 1 to 0.6) again, do not touch anything else, such as the related file named enableulps_na7) continue to press f3 and look to see the enableulps file in the other numbered folders (0001, 0002, and so on - for my card it went up to 0006).  it will probably already be 0 in the other numbered folders, but in case it's not, if it is 1 in any of those, double click the registry entry and change them from 1 to 0 in the other numbered folders as well. continue to press f3 and you will also see the same entry in a driver subfolder (enableulps).  double click on it and set it from 1 to 0 wherever you find the specific entry.9) if this fixed your situation, do a little happy dance, as this horribly annoying issue is finally done and over with!10) save these instructions for the future. when you update your drivers or have to do system rollbacks etc, it may come back, and you may need to disable this function again. it also is almost always the cause of this horrible issue, and we need to make sure to pass it around to other amd users.in case you're worried that this is disabling something important, it's not. ulps stands for ultra low power setting. it's this ultra low power mode, unrelated to your usual power settings. if it sees that your monitor is switched off for a little bit or you're idle long enough, it turns itself on. and yet for some stupid reason, for too many of us, it doesn't turn itself back off when you turn your monitor back on or try to use your pc. so it's in this ultra low power mode that can't even send a picture to your monitor, and for a great many of our systems, it doesn't know enough to toggle back out of it unless we manually reboot (or worse - unplug for some people). so it's nearly useless, causes all sorts of issues, and you don't have to worry that you're turning off something important.we tried this on a r13 with a 6800 xt yesterday where the aw3420dw wont wake up from sleep after a couple of hours idle but unfortunately it didnt seem to work.disabling power save mode in the osd didnt work either.today we will try to see if uninstalling awcc might help since other users in this forum reported this as a possible solution.fwiw. i have an rx6600 in my self built desktop.  i don't have this problem. dell forum member since 2002dell inspiron 15  gaming 5577 laptophome built desktop pc with gigabyte designare z390,  i9 9900k cpuwindows 11 64 bit pro, 22h2, ssd drives. cakewalk by bandlab and studio one 4.6 pro recording studio software, motu ultralite mk5 recording interface unit.dell s2719dgf monitorhey, can you please help me in below post?https://www.dell.com/community/alienware-desktops/area-51-r2-upgrade-in-2022-2023/m-p/8305723/i am facing the same issue and want a solution for it.thanks\n",

      "content:  hey,i am using windows11 with an amd graphics card (6800 xt) and the newest firmware for the monitor(m3b102) and ddm 2.0.0.135i am trying to set up hdr: smarthdr is active and also hdr in win11. in the ddm i can for example set the profile to displayhdr or hdr peak 1000. but if i want to set color -> auto, i only have the different sdr profiles to choose from.is there a solution to showing the correct hdr profiles under the color tab?i also encountered lagging and blackscreens for some seconds sometimes when going into and out of fullscreen youtube videos with smarthdr enabled. it seems the monitor is trying to switch unsuccessfully to sdr in that time or something similar. i can reproduce it easily when going in and out of fullscreen for like 10-20 times it will happen at least once. maybe the problems are connected.thanks in advance!i attached the screenshots from my ddm:the settings show up properly on mine. it's weird, because the ddm is working for switching between the smarthdr modes but still showing the sdr profiles under the color tab. i tried installing the older version of ddm (doesn't work with this monitor), .134 and .138 beta -> no difference, same problem as with the .135 version.at least the blackscreens i could find the problem, it only occurs if i switch under the color tab from manual to auto (even if on auto both desktop and uwp application stay on \"standard\" profile). it seems ddm tries to switch to this sdr standard profile then. now i let it stay on manual with the \"standard\" profile and that doesn't happen anymore. so these problems are connected.is there any possibility to force ddm to show hdr profiles in the drop-down menu instead of the wrong sdr profiles?i have my monitor set to smart hrd 400 true black at the monitor menu and have windows set to hdr mode. ddm shows the correct hdr versions.i do use windows 10 rather than windows 11, and i have no issues with any black screen or switching modes when viewing youtube or other videos.when you set the windows desktop to hdr mode and the monitor to hdr mode it should stay in hdr mode.i have the exact problem. using rx 6950 xt latest driver and newest ddm. i also have major problem using windows 11 hdr calibration tool to create a hdr color profile. using the slider to set black level etc the amd driver times out and often crashes totally meaning i have to reboot.  i just reinstalled windows 11 but the problem persist. it does not do that with mine. when the monitor and desktop are set to hdr mode, it should stay in hdr mode regardless of ddm selections.you can check the hdr mode using the osd menu from the monitor. if you go to game and then select a preset mode, a message will show up telling you it's currently in hdr mode and it cannot switch until you stop playing back hdr content. the hdr content here is the desktop hdr mode set under windows, which will apply hdr mode to everything that is displayed using the desktop.  i uninstalled dell display manager and hdr is working now on my system. seems like amd drivers with this dell display manager is not working correctly.  ah that could be possible. i am using an nvidia card.\n",

      "content:  i am upgrading my aurora r13 ssd drive for more capacity. once i do how do i get the computer's factory os and software reinstalled? from what i know the recovery partition is on the drive i am removing, and i can only find support to create a usb recovery image, but my system doesn't let me boot to a usb. so how do i go about getting my windows 11 reinstalled?  this is how i think it goes . . .use macrium reflect free version to create an image of your current ssd and a bootable usb flash drive. replace the current ssd with the new ssd and connect the bootable usb flash dirve. power up and f12 into bios to change your boot sequence to boot from the usb. once you are booted into windows, use macrium reflect to copy the image to your new ssd. yes this is how it would normally go but for whatever reason this alienware doesn't let you use boot from usb. i went through this before when trying to load a third party memory test that tested the memory after it booted to itself from usb. when i couldn't get it to work i went searching the message boards and i found articles saying there is something in the system bios which prevents it.i need to go research again though because the option to change it i think was available but it just gave a warning about screwing up the current system but if i am starting fresh that wouldnt be an issue to change.  i think it had some thing to do with my system being uefi and using secure boot  with the drive in raid (even though its a single drive they defaulted it to raid and it needs to be the other option starts with an 'a') or something like thati replaced my system hard drive (nvme) with a new model about two years ago with no problems since.i used macrium reflect home to clone my old hard drive to an ssd i installed in the computer.  then i replaced the nvme with the blank new model; and if i recall correctly, it booted into windows 11 automatically from the ssd.  then i used macrium reflect home to clone the ssd to the new nvme; removed the ssd and bingo...windows 11 and all data from old nvme transferred to new model.no problems after doing this on my aurora r9.  switching out the nvme was time consuming since i had to remove both of my video cards (sli) to get at the nvme.  the only disadvantage i have found with the nvme format is access, since it's mounted to the mother board; of course, the tiny aurora case doesn't help any.  all drives were 2 tb, and i was using only about 1tb.  i always powered off and unplugged, better safe than sorry, before disconnecting/reconnecting any drives.also, i do not have windows fast start turned on. hope this helps.  best of luck!an external m.2 nvme adapter something like this will allow you the copy the image or clone from macrium to the new m.2 ssd.don't need to go to bios to select usb drive too boot from. simply press f12 during post and it will present you with a 1 time boot menu, and you will get a list of all detected drives and the option to select which one you want to boot from.select the usb from that list and it will boot from usb. make sure you can boot from the boot media and do not delete any drive information until you have your new drive up and running.\n",

(buying a machine is not an option since my credit score is low and i have no family to sign with). hope everyone had a great new year's.where there's a will there's a way 2x rtx 3090 wow system requirement recommended directx® 12 capable 8 gb gpu nvidia® geforce® rtx which includes 2080 or 3060 or higher d4 recommended nvidia geforce gtx 460 or ati radeon hd 6870 or better, which is much lower than wow.therefore if you have a stock dell gtx gpu you can consider rtx 2080, 2080ti, 3060 or higher depending on your budget for those games.note r2 cpu is old and will bottleneck high end rtx gpu significantly benchmatk if cpu is i7-3820 in r2  benchmark if cpu is i7-4960x to make a long story short, it will not be economical to upgrade that machine for wow/diablo4 with the best settings.if you want the best settings, a complete new machine is the only economical system upgrade. your best option for that would be to look for holiday deals, if you can afford it.otherwise there's not much i can recommend, unless you can find a cheap second hand 1070 gtx or something like that. but that comes with it's own risks since it would be a used card. you would also have to make sure your power supply supports any gpu upgrades, and as mentioned below you are likely going to run into a cpu bottle neck. what components do you currently have in your rig?unless i missed it, your post doesn't say what components or video-card are inside it now, so not sure how we can advise you on which 1-2 components to upgrade.i can tell you that system requirements for wow and especially diablo-4 are very low. based on previous experience, i can tell you a normally configured aurora-r6, with just an ssd, intel-i7, 16gb ram, and gtx-1070 can easily run those.\n",

      "content:  pls help me! i got my son the bottom of the line r11 a few years ago. we just upgraded the gpu to a geforce rtx 2060 which is causing it to over heat. we bought a new case thinking it would help with air flow but after switching noticed a few issues1. the pre installed fans can’t be used with that mobo2. it doesn’t power on now but when holding down the power button on the psu the cpu fan spinscan anyone advise as my son is quite upset his pc is not working. so did you move all the parts from the bottom of the line r11 into a new case? if so you will need to find a way to remove the r11 fans and connect those fans that came with the r11 motherboard or the system will trigger a bios error. don't use the fans from the new case. the alienware aurora's are picky what parts it will accept. what size power supply was in the bottom of the line r11? if it is too low in power it may not be able to run an rtx 2060 and as a result the pc might not power on.he was able to use the 2060 before we switched so i assume it should work in the new case. it’s a 550 psu and yes we switched everything except the power on/off buttons and wiring. i did switch the fans that came with the r11 too and still not powering onit's possible the wiring is oem and does not conform to the atx standard. i am surprised the motherboard did fit in the new case. usually they don't fit properly.the front i/o panel wiring is indeed proprietary . . . but there is a work-around. this discussion provides the pinouts and jumpers necessary.i would try two things:1) put the original gpu in the pc and see if it boots.2) i would try and re-seat the memory modules just in case they got bumped.does the fan on the cpu cooler spin when you power it on?here is the whole guide how and what to do to make it work!!!https://youtu.be/yk4qubjufoowow i appreciate this info but this goes beyond my scope of knowledge. is there any way someone could dumb this down for me? if not i’m just going to put everything back in the old case and call it a day!i did try both of these things. the fans only spin if i hold down the power reset button on the actual psu. other than that….nothing. another option is to purchase a retail motherboard and put that in the new case, than move over all your components to the new board/case.it will be a lot easier and more compatible with future upgrades than trying to get that alienware board to work properly in a retail case.\n",

      "content:  hi, our alienware aurora r4 isn’t getting past post.we are running on windows 10 alienware bios version a11 and it’s had a windows update which required the pc to be restarted.gone ahead with the restart and it gets to the shut down point and won’t then get past post without giving us beep code 1.it has happened previously (see image) (don’t know why it thinks we have overclocked as we have never touched those settings)and we have been able to get it started again by removing the mouse or keyboard and replacing them. but now there has been another windows update as explained above.yesterday we tried removing hardware (removing the ram gave us the two beep code and returned to one beep code when we reinstalled the ram) so we power drained and removed the graphics card and cmos battery and left it over night. this morning we put the cmos battery and graphics card back in and managed to get it past post to this screen:posts online said to press f2 so we tried it and next it took us to the bios menu where it said to change the boot mode from uefi to legacy. we did this and then the computer went to restart and went back to the post screen (one bios beep) and got stuck there again.we just want to get to the os so we can run system diagnostics as we believe it may be a windows update issue (parents have an alienware r8 that just had a windows update and had misplaced personal settings but i managed to solve it with the windows onboard diagnostic software which fixed the misplaced files and i believe that may be our issue if it is a bios fault)the computer has only been used for digital artwork with a drawing tablet and photoshop. no heavy hardcore gaming and there has been no issues with the computer when in use apart from being a bit slow on loading photoshop up.hope you can help.update: just tried the ram sticks. got 1 beep code in every slot tried, until we got to slot 4 where it started up with no beep codes but no video either so couldn’t tell if it was getting past post or not.i have seen that w my r4.  mistake is to allow windows 10 update which often messes up cmos settings.  in this relatively old model, disconnect all storage devices and replace cmos battery w a new one.  you may also try clear cmos settings by rtcrst jumper on motherboard.  try to boot into bios without hdd/ssd to establish a good post first.  if successful then put a blank hdd in and do a clean os win 10 pro latest ver install.  after install use gpedit.msc to disable auto windows update for good.thank you for your help and apologies for the delayed response.we tried booting with a new cmos battery and did the jumper reset too and tried to boot without hdd/ssd as suggested but sadly it couldn’t get past the post check and kept giving us the repeating one beep.a few weeks prior i did manage to do a system hardware health check (sorry i tried to share a screenshot but it’s not working) that basically said the performance of everything is poor and needs replacing and also said ‘missing events in event log 44%’ not sure what that is about. not sure why it keeps loading upside down from my phone and apologies for the poor quality but hopefully it can be read. if not i can write it out. tried it again and managed to boot it up (sorry about the clutter, it’s a small room)we then pressed f1 and got this:so we pressed f1 again and it booted and finished updating windows and shut down.we tried to switch it on again but went back to the post issue again. will have another look later and try the rest of what you suggested (good job we had literally just ordered a new ssd and has arrived)thank you for your help!  a 1 beep error is usually bios corruption and it can sometimes only happen occasionally or sometimes constantly with no boot to the os.i have repaired a few aw laptops with a 1 beep error but never tried it on a desktop. on the laptops it requires you to extract a file from the bios, put it on a bootable usb, and force the system to boot from the usb by holding down the end key while plugging the power in. i'm not sure if this process is possible on a desktop but it could be a last resort if you have no choice. main machinesalienware m18x r2 i7-3920xm, gtx 970m, 16gb 1866mhz ddr3l, 970 evo nvmealienware area-51 alx i7-975, gtx 980, 16gb 1600mhz ddr3, dell u2913wm ultrawide othersm18x r2, 17 r1, m17x r3, m17x r2, m15x, aurora r4 alx, x51 r1tried it again and managed to boot it up (sorry about the clutter, it’s a small room)we then pressed f1 and got this:so we pressed f1 again and it booted and finished updating windows and shut down.we tried to switch it on again but went back to the post issue again.  so, you dragged the alien-monster out from under the desk huh? they are heavy and well built aren't they ? (i still have my working aurora-r1).it's really an aurora-r4 alx (very rare) because it has the extra leds and louvers on top. be sure the 3 aa batteries for the extra alx light are good-and-fresh (for some reason, iirc, that causes some weird problems).that display looks very messed up. like you might want to try a spare pcie video card? maybe?as far as the over-clocking message ... correct ... it should not be over-clocked and if you can ever get into the bios, load bios defaults and be sure all oc is off.between the unexpected oc messages and that weird split-screen-ish display at post or around bios initialization ... it looks pretty jacked-up. i'm surprised you got it back into windows. could it be an issue with a11?found this on another forum:windows-10-killed-my-dell-xps-2710-a-10.html quote:\n",

      "content:  hey everybody, it seems as if my asus vg259q monitor is starting to brightness flicker (screen briefly turns into a darker color) when playing any game in 144hz full-screen.this is very disappointing as my preferred refresh rate is 144hz when playing games as it is very smooth! i managed to figure out that g-sync is the main culprit of the flickering which is great but i do not want to get rid of it.upon further research, a lot of people say that the flickering is normal but i had no issues for the longest time. i am still not able to update my alienware bios (1.0.23 july 2022) to any other version including the 1.0.26 build from this month. another possibility could be my 1660ti in some capacity. these could be the reasons why it is acting up, some advice would be appreciated.my nvidia and intel drivers are up to date, so i'm not sure what is exactly causing the flickering and do not want to return the monitor if possible.update: i changed my monitor to \"fixed refresh\" in the nvidia control panel which seemed to fix the issue. however, this turns off g-sync which completely defeats the purpose of having the technology. also, i still don't know how to update the bios even after attempting to install the current version through supportassist and older ones on dell's website.any advice to remove the brightness flickering to enjoy g-sync and update my r8 bios would be appreciated, thanks!it uses amd freesync and is gsync compatible. i highly doubt the motherboard bios has anything to do with it.it could be a driver issue, a setting, or an issue with the monitor itself.it's also possible your frame pacing is all over the map and causes the vrr not being able to keep up. if you get no screen tearing in fixed refresh rate, than you should be good to go.i agree with @vanadiel in that blaming the aurora-r8 bios is quite a reach.i think more likely asus monitor, the video-card, the video-card drivers, your nvidia settings, or even the cable (in that order).i just got my first g-sync capable monitor. i found this page helpful:https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-nvidia-g-sync-for-smooth-tear-free-pc-gamingthanks for the information, i tried re-plugging all cables to the monitor but no dice.i purchased a new cable today that will hopefully fix the issue.for the frame pacing part is there anything i can do to fix that situation? thanks for the help!you would first have to determine if you have a frame pacing issue. guide  add frametime to the monitored values and make sure it's shown both in numbers and graph. you want a flat as possible graph. if it contains constant up and downs you have a frame pacing issue.i hope your day is going well. when using \"fixed refresh\" is it okay to keep my previous settings i.e. v-sync on in nvidia control panel, v-sync off in games and cap the max frame rate three frames from my refresh rate? (144hz)i'm just trying to get the best combination in order to maximize frames and avoid screen tearing since i was so used to relying on g-sync.as always, thanks in advance for the help!with v-sync on it will sync to the monitor's set refresh rate, or try to. i cap the maximum refresh rate at the refresh rate of my monitor and let gsync handle the frames below max refresh rate. i don't use vsync. \n",

      "content:  windows 11 user here.  just got this dell alienware monitor and it is incredible.i calibrated it with an i1 display pro in the custom sdr picture setting and let displaycal manage the profile association (have an nvidia 3070 gpu).  to support the high refresh rate of the monitor, i must create a custom resolution in the nvidia control panel and bump the refresh to 144hz and color bit depth to 10bit.  the question i have is that i would like to switch between sdr and hdr modes but every time i swap to hdr then back to sdr, all my settings get cleared.  i must recreate the custom resolution, set desktop scaling to 125%, reenable the displaycal icc profile, etc. as if it was the first time i setup the monitor in windows.this could quite possibly be a microsoft or nvidia question, but does anyone have a suggestion to allow swapping between picture modes (sdr to hdr and back) without wiping the sdr color and resolution settings in windows?  windows does have a shortcut to do this.thanks!solved!go to solution.thanks!  i think i found the way to retain settings.  using the \"win+alt+b\" shortcut in windows 11 to flip from hdr to sdr, the monitor honors my default settings and properly swaps between my vibrated custom sdr preset and true black 400 hdr.  looks like i am all set!view solution in original posthi @psuhammer welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. qd-oled gets cheaper - alienware aw3423dwf vs aw3423dw - youtube hi @dell-chris m seemingly this aw3423dwf, rtx 3070 toggle sdr between hdr thread should be posted in monitors - dell community. please move. thank you. similar thread solved: s3221qs, rtx 3070, cannot enable hdr? - dell community.  for some reason, i didn't see the option to pick a specific forum.  it asked what product it was and when i entered \"alienware\" it must of defaulted to laptops.  if i could move it, i would.  hi @psuhammer thank you for sharing clarification, no problem, a forum moderator has been asked to move this thread for you. i have this exact same monitor and calibrator. the monitor should have come with a factory calibration report.since this monitor is factory calibrated with a photo spectrometer rather than a colorimeter, there's little to no point calibrating it for better performance. you would need equipment that would cost well over $30,000 to be able to try and get a \"better\" calibration.this is the probe they use at the factory to calibrate each of these monitors: konica ca-410 the de of the monitor comes from the factory with an average de below 3, meaning any adjustments to get a lower average de are not visible to the human eye.this monitor can display a very wide color gamut and has very high color accuracy in both sdr and hdr modes. i find the best hdr mode to be true black 400, with dark stabilizer set to 1. in sdr the full gamut (default setting), or dci-p3 both cover their full spectrum without any noticeable errors. chances are high any calibration with the display pro will make it actually less accurate and likely will mess up the almost perfect gamma curve.  the true black 400 mode is vesa certified. forgot to add this monitor supports up to 165 hz, so i am not sure why you need to set a custom display resolution. the default refresh rates supported should be 100, 144 and 165 hz. anything over 100 hz is 8 bit with color dithering. you will not see a difference between 10 bit and 8 bit color modes. thanks for the response.  couple items:the calibrated modes are srgb and dci-p3 as per the calibration sheet. you can validate any color mode you like, but be aware this oled does not use wrgb but instead uses a triangular rgb sub pixel layout.you would likely benefit from a correction profile. i don't know if they have one available for that meter and this panel yet. they are usually available from other users on the displaycal forum.you can validate and see how yours compares to other tests with different equipment:tomshardware rtings same panel dw  as for 8 versus 10 bits, it affects color depth and provides more shades of color to decrease the banding effect. however, this monitor has no banding effect to speak of.you can check for banding online: gradient check thanks!  i think i found the way to retain settings.  using the \"win+alt+b\" shortcut in windows 11 to flip from hdr to sdr, the monitor honors my default settings and properly swaps between my vibrated custom sdr preset and true black 400 hdr.  looks like i am all set!hi @psuhammer thank you for sharing the \"windows + alt + b\" key combination shortcut in windows 11 to toggle from hdr to sdr. \n",

      "content:  i purchased my alienware area-51 r2 around september of 2015. i know, it's an old pc, but it still has some decent components,the pc has a gtx 970,intel core i7-5820k32gb of ramthe pc ran like a beast up until 2021 where i can remember clearly the pc running perfectly fine until i played the game anthem, upon loading the game the pc fans kicked up to 100% i never heard my fans get this loud where it sounded like a jet engine for a good minute or so, until i closed the game application. since then, my cpu has not been the same since. on a pc where the fans were barely noticeable, now are running at 60-70% usage to keep the cpu from reaching even higher temps, the cpu now just booting up will reach 70c, and on windows reach up to 90c - 92c the pc is basically unusable now.i did attempt to see if the thermal paste dried out, so i redid the thermals, it helped a little lowering the temps to around 85c - 89c, i also tried reseating the cpu just to make sure nothing got moved around weird, but the temps remain pretty much the same.i did notice some noise from the aio pump, i hear a rattling noise upon booting up the pc, so i don't know if my aio pump died? i also notice when the cpu gets up to 90c that one of the hose's gets extremely hot where you can burn your hand just touching the hose, while the other hose feels like room temperature to the touch.i was questioning if i should try to go on ebay to buy another aio pump, or is there damage to the cpu that i would need to replace the cpu instead?anyone have an ideas what could be the issue?solved!go to solution.a51 r2 it is oem aio made by asetek for dell.  according to cass original alien cooler (k31vh) for r2 is entry-level 27mm wide (120x27) which is also used in r4/r5r4/r5 also uses a newer aio which is backward c/w r2.r2 = k31vh or h4tyr (slightly older gen asetek 27mm circa 2014)r4/r5 = nvddx (newer gen asetek 27mm circa 2017)i would use this opportunity that original aio died to upgrade the cooler if within dell oem family rather than keep on using the same used old stock. the newer pump uses sleeved tubes which look more premium than the plain tubes of old pump. view solution in original post7 year old aio is end of life. i would replace the aio. you cannot just purchase the pump, you need to purchase the whole unit.i am assuming you removed all the old thermal paste before applying the new one?i would also double check the cooling fan on the aio, to make sure the bearings are not gone on it.and a good cleaning with compressed air would also be a good thing to do.i figured the aio is end of life, and yeah, i would replace the whole unit.i did clean up the old thermal paste before applying, it did help the temps a bit, but the fans are still running pretty highi did a really good cleaning before applying the new thermal paste, the pc is quite clean, so i'm guessing the aio pump died cause i notice the two hoses aren't the same temp, one is room temperature while the other is extremely hot to the touchwould you suggest buying the same / used pump on ebay? or should i buy a non alienware aio pump?  this is one of the options i was looking at: https://www.ebay.com/itm/385167258678?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=dculsnshtgg&sss...the easiest is to purchase the exact oem replacement, so you don't have to fiddle around with anything.you should get another 7 years out of it.a51 r2 it is oem aio made by asetek for dell.  according to cass original alien cooler (k31vh) for r2 is entry-level 27mm wide (120x27) which is also used in r4/r5r4/r5 also uses a newer aio which is backward c/w r2.r2 = k31vh or h4tyr (slightly older gen asetek 27mm circa 2014)r4/r5 = nvddx (newer gen asetek 27mm circa 2017)i would use this opportunity that original aio died to upgrade the cooler if within dell oem family rather than keep on using the same used old stock. the newer pump uses sleeved tubes which look more premium than the plain tubes of old pump. thank you for the information! i'm going to purchase the newer pump you linked, i'll post an update here if this resolves the temperature issues.this from dell chris marea-51 r1 2009hrgd5 asetek 35-101-1012118 & 35-101-1012150r5tnt asetek 35-101-1012119 & 35-101-1012151area-51 r2 2014h4tyr asetek 35-102-0000002area-51 r3 2017 (august)vtrg3 asetek 35-102-0000145area-51 r4 2017 (september)h4tyr asetek 35-102-0000002vtrg3 asetek 35-102-0000145area-51 r5 2018 (february)h4tyr asetek 35-102-0000002vtrg3 asetek 35-102-0000145area-51 r6 2018 (february)hr6v4 asetek 35-102-0000163i finally got the new pump, sadly to find out that the screw holes don't line up with my area 51 r2 case, i also notice the heatsink looks beefier than my previous r2 aio/heatsinkis it possible to remove the screw plate and add it to the new pump? or would i damage the pump doing this?this is the pump, with the screws not lining up with the motherboardtry rotating it 90 degrees in either direction.\n",

      "content:  hi..i recently bought a brand new alienware aurora r14 (ryzen 7 with 6600). windows side works fine. but when i load valorant or minecraft or fortnite. the pc suddenly shut down. i had google. could it be gpu or power supply. what software or tools can i use to determine the issue?thanksdid you get the air cooled package or is it liquid cooled? if it's air cooled, install and run hw monitor and check the temps. you might want to run some benchmarks to gauge what the temps look like to see if it shuts down besides when you are gaming.i would run the pre boot diagnostics and make sure it passes everything.pre boot diagnostics its liquid cooler.  i will try to run the diagnostic tool when i get home.   thankshi panda,first, you should identify whether the problem is hardware or software/driver related.hardware:1. run pre-boot diagnosis, and individual thorough test (stress test) for every hardware component. see if there is any error. normally if there is faulty hardware component, the report will show.2. run temperature checking tool (with logs generated and saved) while you are running the game. then after the shutdown/restart, open the log file and identify whether there is overheat issue with the gpu or cpu.software/display driver:1. update bios to the latest version available.2. update the display driver from the official website (nvidia or amd).3. read my following post which i have successfully resolved the display driver related issue. (add 2 registry keys will resolve the issue).https://www.dell.com/community/alienware-desktops/aurora-r13-auto-restart-when-playing-wow/m-p/81031... all diagnostic tools tests passed. but pc keep shutdown when game starts.  on friday i spend 3 hours on phone and remote access with tech support.  then then tech support joined another (level1) team leader, upgrade, uninstall, reinstall driver, amd gpu, ssd (samsung). bios, and many other.  still same problem.  then he said uninstall the game and reinstall the game and find afew more games and try see if it shut down with different games.  he check all crashed report (real event, hwinfo and many other software in pc)on sat, uninstall valorant reinstall the whole thing abt 20gig and took abt 3hours.  install fortnite, total accurate simulator.  they all crashed.  call tech support again. speak to different tech support, and then connect to level 2 team leader.  do same test and ask me to start different game beside valorant.  so i start with the free and  <profanity removed.tos73> gpu game (total accurate simulator - my little boy love this). crashed - shut down straightaway.   so he download again all the crashed report and other hwinfo and real event data.  he could not give me an answer but he said he will escalates to high level and get back to me for more testing or an solution.  i ask for replacement since it brand new and setup on friday afternoon thats when i called in.  he said he can see the service tag active that day.  now i have to wait till monday!very frustrating and disappointing with alienware/dell dealing elf (early life failure)  for a $4299 pc that didnt work from day one. will update this on monday   check with bsodviewer if is a bsod or not. if is a bsod what is stopcode.the amd versions (r10/r14) are usually very stable with few reported issues.as always, you could have been the unlucky one. just make sure to start the process as soon as possible for either a refund or exchange, since there are time limits on it.a person who can assist you with any warranty issues is @dell-cares all i want a working gaming pc for my son. its his xmas present.  so exchange with delivery given date is fine.  i just couldn’t believe that dell/alienware didn’t take it very seriously. two separate teams and team leaders can’t diagnose the problem and find me a solution.  all tests and all crashed report and system info have been collected should be enough evidence of elf. i dont think it zyren (amd).  i think it the gpu.  but dell think its something else like driver or software side. well wait and see what they have to tell me on monday!   run this, probably a driver crash cause your shutdownblue screen of death (stop error) information in dump files.

      "content:  so there appears to be an issue with the latest awcc 5.5.26.0, a00 and at least my particular configuration. i have a case open with support and they are escalating it to engineering. i spent two hours on a call with a very helpful tech. after a few uninstalls (with and without revo) and some unsuccessful reinstall attempts it appears that (surprise) awcc is buggy. it looks to be somehow related to how system peripherals are identified during installation. they are also working on the conflict with windows core isolation and awcc. dell support is aware of the ongoing issues with awcc and it remains a work in progress. so we'll see what happens going forward.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! i had a similar issue with the latest awcc and my r13.  did the same thing with the uninstall, clearing the registry, even installing older versions.  look for my post from this thread \"aurora r14, awcc not working, cannot reinstall\", if you would like to try another wacky solution that does not involve reinstalling windows!  i am now up and running totally fine with 5.5.26.  in summary, it was a stuck prior version of the peripherals/components drivers that no amount of registry editing was going to find. thanks for the tip. unfortunately, it didn't work for me. the 5.5.26 installer still does not successfully complete for me after following your instructions. but i did find another temporary fix that i'm going to go with for now. i managed to successfully reinstall awcc 5.4 and that is working. so until they come up with a working solution for 5.5, i'll just run with awcc 5.4 for now.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! further update. the earlier version of awcc is not fully functioning either. the failure again points to a couple of factors. inability of the installer to continue if it encounters files missing that it want to clean up, and also a failure on peripheral identification and initialization. where i am now is that the core awcc will load but only identifies the cpu.it then indicates that it needs to download additional components which i suspect are the peripheral drivers. if i skip the download awcc continues to run in the crippled state ii described. if i start the download, it will hang either with or without the spinning purple dots. windows notifications will indicate that the component download is complete but then hangs at 70% installed. that’s probably the same point at which the main installer program quits during a complete install attempt. i’m going to report this on my open ticket in hopes it will help engineering to identify and fix the issue(s).i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! and a final update. after being away for a few days, i restarted my computer, and awcc auto-updated to v5.5.35.0, a00, and magically fully works again. there is still the issue with core isolation not playing well with the oc settings, but other than that, awcc seems back to normal.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! unfortunately as new windows updates come, awcc will give you more problems. everything is a temporary solution. it's ridiculous that this software is so bugged. if there was another software that i can control my fans and prolong the life on my laptop, i'd pay for it in a heartbeat. i've been using my m17r3 for 2.5 years now. on average, every other month i encounter problems with awcc. however, for the past few months, i can't even install awcc because the wizard keeps getting interrupted. so i resorted to a 2020 version - worked for awhile - and then today my thermals and peripherals are just in an infinite loop again. i reckon it has to do with windows update and what not. ridiculous.i have said before they should break up awcc into it's base components, like fan control, oc control, rgb control and sound control etc...this way you can install what you need and drop all the rest that you don't need.agree completely. most “all-in-one” types of software packages are sort of like “jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none” deals. this goes back to my earliest experiences with integrated software. in the 1980s, ashton-tate was selling framework. that package was nowhere close to as good as lotus 1-2-3, wordperfect, and d-base were separately. thus began a long parade of mediocre all-in-one software suites, the latest of which are office 365 and awcc. the ability to pick and choose would be a good thing, imo.i am a dell techexpert. i am not a dell employee. i enjoy using my free time to help the community. if you find my posts useful, you can thank me by clicking on kudos! i think a full awcc is over a gigabyte, which is a lot for what it does...i thought i was able to prevent awcc from auto-updating on my working 5.5.26, but i was wrong.  i have microsoft store set to no autoupdates, and i disabled awcc from the firewall.  it still auto-updated to 5.5.35, must launch some hidden service that allows it to automatically download and install without user prompts (is this bypassing microsoft security?). the firewall block did prevent the modules from updating, which of course the .26 modules do not work with .35.  so had to manually download and run the full awcc installer. all is working fine now on 5.5.35, would really like a method to prevent these auto-updates. \n",

      "content:  hi,i had issue with awcc and wmi that kept running. constantly had my mouse showing the blue circle  as when something running backgroundissue appeared when i installed the 5.5.9.0 version awcc version and add constant wmi issue. previous version was 5.5.8 coming from 5.4.35 (5.5.0.0 was not working, installation failed)so, i uninstalled and tried back to 5.5.8. but had the same issue. don't know why it was working before the 5.5.9 was installed (5.5.8 was probably not correctly or fully installed after 5.4.35)went back to the last version  i knew was working 5.4.35 + oc control 1.3.68.1380. (as of 5.5.0 it seems oc control is included). it works fine with this one.i noted that when deactivating dell display001vcpsrv via msconfig makes it work without problem (but i want something that runs without my intervention, so went back to 5.4.35 anyway ) also, display001vcpsrv is not installed with 5.4.35, so i suspect the issue is with this one. wmi is arround 0.1% usage (caused by awcc as it was 0% all the time after system startup and when awcc was not installed), but i don't mind now as my mouse doesn't constantly show that something running int the background hope a solution will be found  went back to the last version  i knew was working 5.4.35 . it works fine with this one. you don't mention what alienware model/release you have, but sounds like you are now running the correct aw-cc version for your machine. each machine tends to have a \"final validated version\" and you really can't go much higher than that it you want it to work properly.hi,i have a aurora r8 (bios 1.0.23) and awcc 5.5.9 was proposed to install by dell support assist.indeed, i guess each machine has a final validated version, and, if the support assist works as intended, i should be able to install the last version proposed without issue.i don't think that this is a question of \"working version\", but a software not stable/tested enough. among all the installed programs, the alienware/dell suite is without a doubt the one that caused me the most trouble, whether it be at the level of installation, stability or slowing down the system. i have alienware computers since 2011, and i know that softwares are not the strong side. but don't get me wrong, i'm not saying the software side is bad, but i'd like it to work without me worrying about.i like my computer but i like having a proper installation, software running nicely, and keeping my stuff updated, but here, well, not the best experience.  that bothers me, but yeah, just my ocd.i suppose that in the next version, the issue would be solved.hi,i have an alienware x17 r2 and i am having the same problem. or maybe a worse problem.1. killing the process \"awcc.background.server.exe\" makes the wmi provider host usage drop from ~8% to ~0.7%. to kill the process i ran: \"taskkill /f /im awcc.background.server.exe\". whenever i start \"awcc.background.server.exe\", the wmi provider host cpu usage rises to ~8% again and several \"errors\" are shown on windows event logs (run \"eventvwr\" and go to \"services and applications logs/microsoft/wmi-activity\"). 2. when the process \"alienwareon-screendisplay.exe\" is running i get 1 error message every 2 seconds. the message is as folows:\"id = {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}; clientmachine = thedeathstar; usuário = thedeathstar\\******; clientprocessid = 102680; componente = unknown; operação = start iwbemservices::execnotificationquery - root\\wmi : select * from biosevent; resultcode = 0x80041032; possiblecause = unknown\"for now, my solution is kill this processes with:taskkill /f /im alienwareon-screendisplay.exetaskkill /f /im awcc.background.server.exei am also running awcc 5.5.9.0, i will try @milkou solution and go back to awcc 5.4.35.0. i hope dell fix this in the next version of awcc.  same issue here. awcc service / awcc background server keeps polling wmi every 2 seconds for something. it's causing noticeable lag in overall system response and issues with mouse movement - the mouse ends up reacting similar to its batteries being near dead (intermittent pauses in cursor movement while moving the mouse).if i stop awccservice, the wmi polling goes away and wmi cpu usage again drops to <1%.here's an example of the error logged in the event log. every. two. seconds. it's rather frustrating.i think i have the same issue with my new alienware m15 r7 laptop... extremely frustrating!  i see wmi cpu usage very high to the point i can barely even troubleshoot the issue.  it just locks it up completely every few hours.  looking at the event log (which took forever), i think i have found it is due to the awcc according to the clientprocessid. i have un-installed awcc completely now to see if this solves the issue (fingers crossed).  when is dell/alienware going to fix this?   \n",

      "content:  i bought the alienware aurora r7 a year ago and the case lights dont stay on longer than the boot up time so im buying a new case the corsair 220t and i want to put all my parts into it, however i need a new psu and im unsure as to what power supply my model is my model number is: \"awaur7-7982slv-pus\" and when i swung out the psu arm there is not a single helpful sticker in sight. i am also interested in a general speed upgrade whilst i have an i7 8700 and a gtx1080 the ram is such a low speed and i need more ssd slots and space and also a better motherboard thats not dell propietary so im thinking the asus z390 ud with new ram sticks corsair vengeance and a new psu but ive no idea which one i would be best fitting with for the 8700 and 1080. can anyone give some suggestions...  it will all be goin in a mid tier corsair 220t will the stock liquid cooler from alienware go into any other pc? or is it only fitted for the aurora???? or should i sell it and get a diff? perhaps rgb i will probs result in that but in the meantime whilst on the road to upgrade i will need it cooled somehow.thanks for any help, general summation of the questions- will alienware stock liquid cooler fit in any other case?- what power supply is my above model number^  \"awaur7-7982slv-pus\"@keyholl16  if this is the case you are getting there is a list of compatible corsair hydro series aio cpu liquid coolers in the tech specs.corsair icue 220t regardless of what your r7 psu is, get something that can handle some future upgrades. i would not get anything less than 850 watts.if the cables can be unplugged from your psu it is 850w, if the cables are not removable it is 460w.  it is made by either delta or huntkey, manufacturer is not relevant for purposes of upgrade.the aio is intel standard 75 mm spacing, mounting bracket is on the backside of the mobo.  so it would work but the rad hoses are probably way too short for all but really small cases.@keyholl16 :1. yes, the aio from your r7 will fit in another case. it's similar to corsair h55 aio. all made by asetek (my new friend on twitter because we be chatting about the new cooler they made for the r11 graphics card).2. that isn't the psu product code. what you pasted is the r7 product code. every system has a unique service tag and with it the original build configuration. you can go to support.dell.com and plug in the service tag to see the psu configuration of your system.are you familiar with building a pc from scratch? because that sounds like what you plan to do. just migrate the cpu, gpu, ssd, ram over.@gts81   are you familiar with building a pc from scratch? because that sounds like what you plan to do. just migrate the cpu, gpu, ssd, ram over.actually, @keyholl16  said we get to buy new ram because the existing is slow . . . and more ssd space. they mentioned more speed, so if the i7-8700 is going to be upgraded, we may not be locked into the z390 motherboard. the gtx 1080 is what i have in the pseudo alien, so i know the perfect water block        personally never done it before but i have a friend whose built around 4 pc's and hes going to help but not going to lie it practically is just migrating those four aspects and putting it into a new casei'm thinking of doing a case swap so i can fit an rtx 3080 in my r7 system. i know i'll have to swap out the psu and get a case big enough to fit the 11.2\" card. have you completed the swap or figured out if the stock r7 liquid cooler will fit into the corsair 220t @keyholl16? if so i might do the same swap. i'd love to know how it went and/or if you had any problems that i should also be wary of. thanks!!!i haven’t swapped yet actually in favour of saving money for a decked out lian li custom loop case cos i got a friend whose gonna help me with it, i recommend upgrading psu and all should work fine so i know that this is an older topic but i wanted to say that i did in fact move all my components from the alienware r7 stock liquid cooled to the corsair 220t.  it was a little nerve racking because i had to use many different forums and sites because of how different alienware does things.  anyways the motherboard will fit i had to move the stand offs in the new case to accommodate the alienware motherboard but they just screw in so that part was easy.  the liquid cooler that came with my alienware did fit however you will have to use it as a back fan/radiator and not a top one like in the alienware case.  as for the power supply i had already upgraded to a fully modular focus px-850 i originally had the 450 power supply that came with the alienware and it just wasnt going to cut it for future upgrades and short cables.  i did not move over the front intake fan from the alienware theres no need for that many fans with three intake fans on the front of the 220t.  for the power button: i did not have to keep the stock alienware head power button from the old case (many people ran into this problem when i was looking up info)  on the cables that come with the 220t take the power sw cable and insert it into the 3rd and 4th pin connection on the led controller connector (white input on bottom left of motherboard next to yellow audio input) this will let you turn on the machine however you will have to use start shutdown to turn off. as for the fans and the light node on the 220t: there is no usb 2.0 connections on the alienware motherboard you will need to purchase an adapter. there are no extra plugs for the fans to go so you will need an extender.  personally what i did was buy a usb 2.0 adapter and then also purchased the icue commander pro to plug the fans into and give the ability to change colors and speeds. now just for a quick fix you can connect the light node cable to the processor fan connector (white connector on left of ram slot) and one of the front fans to the front chassis fan connector (black connector on right of ram slot) this will give you lights and allow one of the front fans to run. the i/o shield on the r7 is part of the case and cannot be removed however you can remove a padded cutout on the back on the i/o shield to use in the new case or purchase an i/o shield for the new case which is what i did. you will get a startup message check saying there is an issue with hardware (front fan etc.) you can either just hold down the esc key to bypass or go into bios to change settings.  i hope this helps someone it took me forever to get it all figured out some by trial and error and some by forums\n",

      "content:  i'm a casual gamer (play games like witcher 3, fallout, greedfall, skyrim, etc) and am looking to upgrade my r4. i've only upgraded the graphics card once prior (gtx 555 to 760), so the list of upgrades i'm looking at is more than a bit intimidating to me. i'm mostly concerned with the compatibility of all the hardware; from what i've found it appears that this list is all compatible, but i'm looking for someone more knowledgeable than myself to verify if that is true before i go and potentially brick my computer. any advice is appreciated.current specs: geforce gtx 760, i7-3820, 8gb ram, windows 7, 1tb storageupgraded specs (depending on compatibility and capacity limits): geforce rtx 2060, i7-4790, 16 gb, windows 10, additional tb of storage for 2 tb totalsolved!go to solution.all the info may be overwhelming.  to upgrade (?what component) or to buy a complete new model.looking at your current gaming benchmark, i would say upgrade only the gpu from 760 to gtx1070 which can be currently bought used for $130 obo is quickest bang for the buck.  vsview solution in original postwell first, i would definitely upgrade your bootable c-drive to a 2.5inch sata-3/600 ssd. since the aurora-r4 is uefi, you might even be able to install a nvme-ssd onto a pcie-addin card (and it will actually boot and be even-faster).memory at 8gb (or 16gb) is fine.i put a msi gaming-x nvidia gtx-1070 into my aurora-r1 and i was able to play fallout-4 (and eventually fallout-76 and many others) at 1200p with high-effects. mine has the 875w power-supply.https://www.dell.com/community/alienware-general-read-only/recommended-nvidia-graphics-cards-for-ali...i have an aurora-r6 now, but the aurora-r1 is our living-room now. its now our htpc for kodi (movie and music) and gaming on projector (steam big-picture-mode with ps4-controller) ... forza-4, nfs-hp-remastered, and the others. audio also via hdmi to onkyo amp.re: upgraded specs (depending on compatibility and capacity limits): geforce rtx 2060, i7-4790, 16 gb, windows 10, additional tb of storage for 2 tb totalrtx2060 has been validated by 31 users in aurora r4.  this includes one using same cpu as you i7-3820.  note all the x79 cpu are old and would bottleneck 2060 significantly.  an older gpu such as gtx 1080 will match the x79 cpu bettervsvs a perfect match  r4 is a unique model in aurora series because it uses hedt x79 chipset that dell normally reserved for area 51.  x79 and lga2011 socket means r4 can only use x series cpu c/w that socket shown below.  i7-4790 is a mainstream consumer line cpu for lga1150 socket and is thus incompatible w r4 motherboard.  if you want to use i7-4790 you would need to get a microatx intel 80 or 90 series chipset lga1150 motherboard to support it, such as xps 8700 (chipset z87). for gaming upgrade, a faster gpu is the crux.  ssd will help you load windows 10 and load games faster but does not help improve gaming fps, which is predominantly determined by gpu.list of user validated cpu in r4list of user validated gpu in r4  in all honestly, rather than trying to upgrade i would just get a new one.by the time you factor in all the pricing for the upgrade components, the issue of making it all work properly, and the chances of pooching something like your motherboard in the process of the upgrade, i would look for holiday deals on a complete new machine. all the info may be overwhelming.  to upgrade (?what component) or to buy a complete new model.looking at your current gaming benchmark, i would say upgrade only the gpu from 760 to gtx1070 which can be currently bought used for $130 obo is quickest bang for the buck.  vsthank you, honestly i will need to google most of those acronyms but this gives me a good starting point.thank you so much for the in-depth response! will most likely go for the i7-4960x / geforce gtx 1080 combo then. i haven't ruled out getting a new pc yet, it's still an option. i need to do more research yet. there are some pretty good sales out there right now on new ones.  current specs: geforce gtx 760, i7-3820, 8gb ram, windows 7, 1tb storageupgraded specs (depending on compatibility and capacity limits): geforce rtx 2060, i7-4790, 16 gb, windows 10, additional tb of storage for 2 tb totalintel i7-3820 is fine (because it's already an i7). clean the liquid-cooler radiator, fans, (and whole insides) but be very careful with it (i would not mess with a re-paste).you can upgrade to windows-10 64-bit (likely for free, still) but no further. not only because windows-11 needs tpm and a newer processor, but because your last aw-cc is only validated to run on windows-10.personally, i would just do ram (if you feel you must), ssds and video-card. any more than that and you should really consider a new computer. i've done some thinking on this, and i'm going to hold off on upgrading the processor for now, and focus on upgrading the os, graphics card, ram, and storage capacity (can always do the processor later if i feel i need the extra boost). i have more questions:1) what should i upgrade first, the os or the hardware?2) how do i determine what ram i currently have, so i know what to buy to go from 8gb to 16? (or possibly 24gb, i am considering this now.) system specs say i have either ddr3-1333 pc3-10600, ddr3-1600 pc3-12800, or ddr3-1866 pc3-14900. also, i read on a different post that you can't just add another 8gb to get to 16gb, you have to discard the old ram and put in all new ram, but i don't know if that's true for my pc? seems to me as long as you install the same type, you shouldn't have to discard the old ram?3) how do i upgrade the storage from 1tb to 2tb? do i just get a second hard drive that matches the first? i am clueless in this area, never upgraded storage capacity before.\n",

      "content:  we just unboxed a alienware r10 ryzen and hooked it up to power, data, keyboard and monitor and turned on.  lights come on, keyboard and and mouse light up.but....the monitor receives no signal.  we tested the monitor and cable using a nintendo switch and both worked fine.  when we hook up to alienware the monitor says \"no hdmi 2 signal\" (when we have it plugged in the 2.0 port, when its in the 1.4 port it says \"no 1.4 signal\").  we tried a usb monitor cable and we got a \"no dp cable\".do we have a faulty computer or are we dumb ?just checking, did you download the monitor drivers and extract them?the first time around i downloaded my drivers, but they are not self extracting, so it's a two step process.all the other drivers for the computer loaded with just the install button, but not the monitor drivers.  and for my monitor, there are separate drivers for display port or hdmi.  something else to keep in mind.hope this helps.@andrew braniff what happens if you connect to the display port of the discrete graphics card?this reply is obviously 2 years too late for the op. but maybe it'll help others searching about this.it's possible that you're not fully pushing the cables into the graphics card such that there's no connection between the computer and the monitor.i've found that on my geforce 3060 ti card, the top of the 4 output ports (where you plug in cables going to the monitors) are sitting too high inside the case such that the ports are barely accessible from the case cutouts. it seems the tolerances for the computer case weren't tight enough such that the output ports are \"blocked\". i've thought of 2 possible solutions: 1) you can open the computer case, loosen the graphics card, and then push it down so that the 4 ports are more accessible through the cutout. 2) take a rotary tool and make that cutout bigger.the top of the graphics card output ports are flushed up against the back of the case\n",

      "content:  <moved out of alienware laptops board and into alienware desktops board. dell-admin>so on christmas i received a alienware aurora r13. at first it was fine, but then yesterday (12/27/2022) it started crashing. i play minecraft (not a hard game to run) and my old asus laptop never had this problem (my frames on this computer are better but it crashes). with what i've seen i think the problem is the graphics card. because when my game crashes the screen freezes and i can still hear the game noises but then my game crashes. another reason that i believe that the graphics card is the problem is the problem is that if i'm using shaders or a high res texture pack it makes the crashes much more frequent. if you could find a solution and inform me how to fix this that would be great. it says it has warranty but i just want my computer running, not really worried about the cost.\n",

      "content:  greetings, i have read quite a number of posts on fan upgrades on this forum and wanted to learn more. i have a liquid cooled r10 and while i do not game i do 3d rendering. with 3d rendering, once you click the “render button” it is full throttle for the next 4 hours or more. i am not currently over clocking (but might dabble into that) and mostly want stability and quiet cooling. my system is currently totally stock. quiet is important. i am hoping to learn what the community arrived at as conclusions, and to gain information on what we are trying to achieve - meaning what specs we are trying to match or beat. i am aware there is a case fan and the aio cooler radiator fan. it would be nice if the solution does not throw bios errors or throw off the alienware apps/bios for monitoring cooling. i am not sure what the radiator fan specs are but know the air cooled fan is quite the beast at nearly 150 cfm. i do not know the case fan specs. i believe both are 120mm.guessing the radiator fan is pwm 4 pin and not sure of the case fan. so far on this forum i get the impression the details matter like rpm, cfm, pwm and the like. appreciate any help moving forward.  i guess there are a lot of previous discussions so i will only add something never discussed here. 1. the radiator fan has an rpm range 800-4000. my assumption is you need at least 2000 rpm fan to avoid bios error ( and it is not the only criteria to meet bios requirements) 2. this forum only discussed ml120pro that can avoid triggering bios error, but there could be some better alternatives! ml120pro is relatively louder compared to noctua a12-25 (only got reports that it works on r10, not r11/12) or be quiet! wing 2. 3. the front chassis fan could have a much wider range of selection since it rarely throws an error code. you can opt for higher cfm or lower noise level depending on your needalso some trivial things that you may not aware:  the widely criticized stock radiator fan comes from nidec, which is a premium vendor supplying high-end server class fans. it may not be quiet but performance and reliability should be better than any retail fans you can buy from the market    noctua fans are your go to here.  noctua 120mm nf-a12x25 pwmthank you for your comments. i did notice the radiator fan this morning as i took it out to photograph it and understand it better. what stood out is it is 147 cfm. that is really close to the air cooled top fan which is 148.9 cfm.i get the impression those are powerful fans. i did not look deeply, yet i did not see any noctua fans that match that including their industrial line. i appreciate you mentioning the rpm of the fan. it would be interesting to know about the actual specs of the fan like acoustics. i took the chassis case fan out to photograph it, yet the fan did not have a sticker saying what it is? does anyone know what it is? is this the same fan? noctua nf-a12x25 pwm, premium quiet fan, 4-pin (120mm, brown) https://amzn.to/3ivekr3also has anyone tried this fan for the case fan? that seems to be the intended use of that fan. noctua nf-s12a pwm, premium quiet fan, 4-pin (120mm, brown) https://amzn.to/3iaonsui wanted to add some additional details….air cooled top fan:avc model data1225b2gdc 12 volts 1.02 ampsps02ball bearing7m0f5:a00148.9 cfm4 pin connector. liquid cooled radiator fan: nidec model 35502p/n b35502-35del7pp749-a02 0z25g ub dc 12 volts 147cfm min. max 1.54 amps max. 4 pin connector. https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-performance-comparison-to-nf-f12-and-nf-s12aif you can afford it, the a is genuinely impressive.interesting. on amazon ( b07657vbqq ) it says it's for low-impedance applications. i take that too mean, it's more of a case fan than a radiator fan?is it that whole static pressure vs airflow thing?i've noticed there are two versions, a 3- and a 4-pin, the latter being more expensive. and it comes in nicer colours, not that that matters in an aw case.i think impedance means resistance - resistance to airflow. so a smooth properly sized duct would offer very little resistance. a complicated computer case with a lot of turns, screens and protuberances would have a  higher resistance. is the inside of case “aerodynamic” so to speak?the r10 case is unique in design. i wonder if the community thinks of that case as normal resistance or high or low or… nexus gives a bad review of airflow.https://youtu.be/8ulhfi5n2hc\"hilariously bad alienware r10 ryzen pc\"\n",

      "content:  my alienware aurora r10 ryzen (build date may 2021) w/ a r7 5800 doesn't appear to have pbo support in the bios, when most users with later build date aurora r10s with ryzen 5000 series procs do. i'm running bios 2.3.2, and the only 'overclock feature' i seem to have is xmp. i've tested the cpu under load and i'm not boosting to the speeds pbo usually does on this chip.machine is air cooled currently, but i have an mh0hn inbound from dell australia. will that unlock the extra features on the mobo? or is something beyond the bios out of date?the other option is that maybe i'm just being dumb? in order to enable xmp, i have to check the box 'enable overclocking feature' --so does that mean that pbo is always enabled when running an xmp profile? i just don't actually see a setting for pbo --and i don't seem to be seeing the 4.8ghz that pbo seems to achieve.it's 4.6 ghz boost, not 4.8 ghz. 5800 oem that being said, i had the same issue on my 3700x on my r10. never was able to see any pbo settings in the bios, while other users had pbo options listed in their bios. how high it can boost, and for how long it can boost, depends on thermals amongst other things.if it runs higher than 3.4 ghz it is boosting. is that because your mobo is zen 2 or because dell has some kind of dual mobo arrangement they're not telling people about? my machine originally shipped with a 3060ti (i got it open box with an oe 3080 last week and i am probably going to get the authorized reseller to exchange the gpu for a liquid cooled oe 3090) --so did my mid-spec gpu machine ship with a different, less oc friendly, mobo? btw from what i've seen the stock boost clock is 4.6 but with pbo on, it seems 4.8 is the norm. i'm hoping the mh0hn i have coming will help with boost clocks, but neither oc1 nor oc2 in awcc does anything to the cpu. likewise, i have zero oc controls in the bios even changing them out. i do have pretty good ram control, and i've been able to get the voltage and timings stable above spec. have basic gpu control in acc but i cannot seem to be able to increase cpu speed at all even in the bios.there's only 2 versions of the motherboard, you have the \"second\" version. i never figured out why it's not visible in the bios. if you use ryzen master you will be able to enable pbo that way.i am pretty sure a liquid cooled 3090 is not going to fit in that case.  the boost frequency is not the same across all models. the 5800 is limited to 4,600 mhz maximum boost. it will not boost over that with pbo.there are no multiplier settings or anything like that in the bios, so ryzen master is your friend.thanks for that. do settings saved in ryzen master persist after reboot for you? i don’t much care if i set the oc in windows or in the bios. i just want to set it up and leave it be. r10 gen1ryzen master settings do not persist after a reboot and they are not automatically applied at boot either.thanks again, do i have the situation correctly: 1) every r10 ryzen, should, in theory have at least minimal cpu controls in the bois.2) some do, some do not. which ones do and do not are somewhat random.3) nobody really knows why and dell hasn't been forthcoming on the issue. thanks!1. not necessarily, as in your case.2. that is correct. i never figured out or received an answer as to why exactly some do and some do not.3. correct.\n",

      "content:  having raid on a single ssd is crazy in my testing of very fast ssds like the kingston kc3000 can kill 25% 0ff its performance.the only benefit to dell is that users will not be able to change the ssd without first going into the bios and changing the settings from raid to achi.as raid hurts performance over stand-a-lone single ssd drives why does dell tech want to still persist in its adoption especially when the latest g15 has only 1 ssd slot? solved!go to solution.the main reason is that it simplifies production -- only one software image is needed regardless of the ssd shipped with the system, rather than needing to have different drivers for samsung, wd, crucial, etc. ssds. view solution in original postthe main reason is that it simplifies production -- only one software image is needed regardless of the ssd shipped with the system, rather than needing to have different drivers for samsung, wd, crucial, etc. ssds. yeah, that makes sense if others are using a different ssd and you want to get the most out of your ssd go into bios change from raid to achi reboot then go into f12 and reset pc saving all your files first to go back the way simply reverse the steps. this knocks off the raid in favor of a single ssd solution mesh on youtube -changing ssd in 5521 explains the steps for a new install if you are thinking about upgrading there seems to now be a revision 2 of this laptop since new.1/ full 140w 3060 the launch only had 115w2/ the mobo is much cooler no matter what you try the max sustained cpu temp only reaches 91 c.3/ power socket mobo inlet now has a click to it early versions did not have and now stays in place4/ trackpad quality much improved.fantastic 12700h performance, brilliant 240hz screen,  3060 scores 22.000 on performance 10.2 which beats an average score from a 3080ti.it is also necessary if your system has optane memory installed.the latest testing i have done, which was a couple of years ago, showed the intel sata/pcie premium driver to be about as fast as a samsung driver in nvme mode.hi, i knew that but that is not an option on this generation of g15 as the motherboard has no specs for it as far as i am aware at this time.that word \"raid\" in bios is not actually raid.i have seen mass confusion because of dell choosing the sata mode to named \"raid\" this particular sata mode works better with dell irst drivers. in my lenovo they call it \"ahci\" and \"nvme\"  and that's the way dell should do it too\n",

      "content:  i recently got a g15 5521 laptop and i use a wired hyper-x cloud ii headset with a usb audio plugin. when everything is normal, i listen to music, videos, etc at around 20-30%, and i have done the same with my past dell laptop. however, if i leave the usb audio plugged in when shutting down the laptop, every time after that the audio through the headset is extremely quiet. if i turn it up to 100% it will about match the 20% before. when this happens i reinstall the audio driver and that seems to fix it until the next time i shut down the laptop with the headset plugged in. any advice?\n",

      "content:  hello dell community.a week ago my i went to charge my laptop again with a new charging socket and a new fresh dell 180 watt charger as suggested in my other discussion well what has happened now is that my laptops charging port sparked and buzzed and even made a smoky, burning smell. after i unplugged it i plugged it back in luckily this time no burning smell but now i get a message saying that my charger cannot be identified and that its going to adjust system performance to the power available which apparently means disabling my gpu which makes the laptop useless and perform like a 1970s ibm computer. how do i fix this silly problem and if possible can i bypass this useless \"performance adjusting\"check the system and adapter carefully as that symptom surely would appear to be a short of some type. did you use a genuine dell oem dc jack or a compatible jack?i used a dell oem dc jack and it was professionally installed. if you do, do you know where the short would possibly be?\n",

      "content:  i have been trying to update the firmware through support assist 1.7.1 to 1.9.0 it tells me to esp disk space not enough, tried restart, install new windows, & it tells me the same message. i don't know what is going with dell i have a g15 5515 amd processor, & never had any issues with updates until now.how large is the hdd/ssd in your system and how much free space is left on the drive? this web page at makeuseof may help.it was a samsung 970 1tb, it had originally at least 600gb left, when i replaced it with intel 660p 1tb it was able to update the bios 1.7.1 to 1.9.0, and my guess it's the ssd chip may have failed. thank goodness i had a warranty for ssd to get another brand of ssd.doing a little googling around... in all likelihood it's not a hardware failure. apparently you're running out of space in the efi system partition, which you don't normally have access to. i'm guessing that over time that partition can fill up, if it isn't managed well by windows and tools like dell's bios updater. (if the author had taken more time to craft that error message, we'd at least be less confused at this point.)i haven't yet looked into ways to access and edit the efi partition, but you don't want to fool around in there without knowing what you're doing (i certainly don't). it's possible to resize it, but that (depending on your layout) requires resizing c as well, and again, potentially invites trouble. i haven't looked at that yet either but it's possible.you can avoid dealing with the efi partition by downloading the .rcv version of the bios update from drivers & downloads and installing the update from usb media, though when it comes time for your next bios update you may have the same issue again. another option would be to reinstall windows from scratch, making sure to delete the partition so it's re-created during installation. this gives you a fresh un-cluttered efi partition along with your fresh un-cluttered windows installation, though restoring your files and re-installing your apps can be rather a pain as well.just want to clear up that when i suggested installing the .rcv version of bios update to avoid expanding the efi partition, that's based on google research, not any personal experience. i can't personally guarantee that it will succeed where the installation utility that runs in windows failed.after seeing your post and having problems with dell bios updates for years, i decided to look around.  i was able to update using the flash drive so all it good, but i checked the system efi partition for what might be in that.there is a dell folder with several layers and in one of them are two bios updates labeled biospre_img.rcv and currbios_img.rcv or at least something close.  if the update needs to replace those files, maybe it is not able to do so.i am currently thinking this might be involved with other failures, but no message is being given, the update just reboots back into the desktop.  i also notice the msinfo32.exe utility show the correct updated bios, but the firmware section of the device manager still shows the older version.\n",

      "content:  so i've bought a new dell g15 5510 gaming laptop, it was all fine the first few weeks until one day i just suddenly got a bsod right after the screen going black after showing the \"shutting down\" screen on windows 11, now this is not a repeating thing because it doesn't always come, sometimes it just comes then it wouldn't for another day or two, what i've found out from some experimenting is that the laptop only shows the error when i shut it down almost instantly after playing a game or after heavy use like watching yt at 4k, other wise it wouldn't if i leave it idling for some time then shut it down, the error stop code was pnp_detected_fatal_error, and bluescreen viewer shows the driver causing it to be something like ntoskrnl or something, after some digging i got to know it might be caused by my alienware command center or due to overclocking, i never tried to do the latter and i don't think that's possible anyways, so i uninstalled the command center, since then that particular error never came back, but i got 2 random bsods again, while i left my laptop idling the other day when i was downloading some games, those 2 were reference_by_pointer and system_service_exception. both of them happened couple of days( or a week) apart, i never got a bluescreen when i'm actually using my laptop and it's just annoying to get these, all these error was caused( according to softwares like bluescreen viewer ) by ntoskrnl. i've uninstalled my alienware control panel ( g-mode doesn't work anymore after i updated bios anyways so that's useless), yesterday i've re installed both my integrated and dedicated gpu drivers, i've run chkdsk and dism, dism fixed one corrupted file( after the reference by pointer bsod) and i ran chkdsk yesterday (because i got the system service exception bsod), it didn't find any errors, i don't think its a hardware error because its a brand new laptop, didn't get an error till now after all that but i will update if it comes again. only thing i've done is basic updates to windows, through support assist as well as windows itself, like bios, everything went successfully with 0 issues.probably the biggest single cause is overheating.with that being said, bsods have a wide number of root causes. my computer became very unstable. i limped along for a long time using dism and sfc utilities to keep windows limping along because i kept putting off the hassle of a clean reinstall. the root cause wound up being memory corruption causing windows file corruption, the memory corruption being caused, i think, by a psu failure. i finally bit the bullet and did a clean reinstall after the bsods became too frequent and too annoying.i've checked the temperatures and it's nothing out of the ordinary temps for gaming laptop, staying usually in the 70-85 degrees celsius range, and again, it doesn't occur when i'm playing games, even for hours, only when i'm shutting it down after playing, or rarely, randomly when it's idling like installing a game, i'm now suspecting the antivirus i have, mcafee, it's always running a million tasks in the background, and does scans when pc is idle, maybe that interferes with the pc while shutting down or something.\n",

      "content:  hello everybody.sorry in advance in case i didn't use the correct section, i'm quote new to the forum itself.i bought my dell last week of november, and since them i've experienced this problem like 2/3 times.it's a win 11, ryzen 7 model, with a 3060 on, and i've basically tryed out all the hardware diagnostics without real results (all were passed with positive results). all my drivers are also up to date.what happens is that my pc would freeze, no bsod or error whatsoever. if i would happen to be in a discord call, i'd still be able to hear the others, but won't be able to talk.i'm not really sure on what to do anymore, hope somebody can help uhm it's really hard to tell. it could be caused by a crashing nvidia driver/process, but normally it would give you a bsod and we would end up having a nice little minidump file to analyse, which would be way easier.on the other hand, quite a few users have been experiencing this same issue while using discord, laptop freezes and they are left hanging with just the voice of their mates in the headset, suggesting it could be a problem with discord, perhaps some audio setting is triggering the crash... do you happen to know if discord was active and running each time this issue occurred? if i were you i would try lowering discord audio settings as much as possible, removing any kind of unnecessary option: voice will probably sound worse but if the system stops freezing then you will have found the culprit.then i would do one simple thing, something i always suggest to every new dell owner: remove supportassist! all it does is scanning your laptop when you least exåect it, it consumes loads of resources for no reason, and it's one of the major causes of bsods. you can install dell update to keep drivers updated, and if you ever want to run diagnostics on your system you can easily do it by pressing f12 at dell logo when you turn on your computer to access the preboot menu.last thing you should check is that both the integrated and discrete gpus are updated on the last driver release distributed by dell, not amd or nvidia. very important. if you see a different/newer release, uninstall it with ddu and install the correct one(s).thanks for the prompt answer!so, 2/3 times there was discord up and running with me in a call, while the third one i was actually in a videocall on whatsapp (windows app) so it could actually be related (?).for the supportassist matter, should i uninstall \"supportassist\" or \"dell supportassist\"? i've got both installed as it seems...last thing is: i actually thought that it could also be related to some windows11 mubmbo jumbo, and was thinking about uninstalling and reinstalling it.you should go ahead and uninstall both the apps, one is likely to be the first/original version which was replaced along the way (around 1 year ago) by a new and improved -lol- release. you can probably still run either, though the old one probably won't detect some of the latest updates... i mean... dell's heart was in the right place, they are trying to offer bug early-detection, drivers update and online support all in one app, but it would need much more polishing to effectively merge with windows utilities and not constantly clash with them, this way it just isn't working.it could have something to do with the audio driver, would you mind going to device manager > sound, video and game controllers and make sure that the driver installed for the realtek high definition audio is the 6.0.9414.1 release?then check for any realtek app installed, it should come with realtek audio controller preinstalled, as well as dolby audio and possibly intelligo audio. try and reset them all, remove any kind of special effect, sound enhancement, try the simplest setup possible, like a basic 2.0 stereo or headset. by the way, if you're using a usb headset set it aside, because usb headsets use their own integrated dac (like a whole different audio chipset) which could be the actual culprit (bypassing the main audio chipset).lastly, if you have half a mind to reinstall windows... don't let me hold you back haha and if/when you do it, this time don't rely on dell os recovery tool: create a windows installation media using the official microsoft tool, and reinstall everything from scratch. don't install any dell app except for dell update, go to the drivers page for your laptop and install everything you need, in the following order: by the way, when you are about to reinstall the os (and only then!), enter the bios and make sure that sata operation is set to ahci, not raid or anything else, otherwise you will likely need to install the intel rst driver during the os installation (or it won't detect any connected drive), which can be quite annoying...i've tuned down all the audio specs in the audio apps you pointed out and, for now, it seems that i didn't experience that issue anymore (in the middle there was also a windows11 update so, who knows?).thanks again for the assistance, i'll let you know in time if the problem was definitely solved!i'm happy to hear that!yes please, do keep us posted, i am sure this will be useful to other users.\n",

      "content:  i'm having a ram problem on my dell g15 5515 ryzen edition laptop. recently, i bought 2 crucial branded ram modules (2x16gb 3200mhz) to replace the original ones (2x8gb 3200mhz), which are compatible with my notebook as specified by the manufacturer.it turns out that only one of the memories worked in my dell g15, i've tested them together, tested them separately, changed slots separately and only one of the two worked (i also performed the procedure of disconnecting the battery and resetting the bios by pressing the power button for 30 seconds before making changes). i also tested with 1x16gb and 1x8gb original that came in lenovo, reversing slots and reversing the memory i tested, and it's always the same 16gb memory that doesn't work. after so many tests, i was convinced that one of the modules was faulty, but i tested both 16gb ram memories on another notebook (lenovo) and both worked (even the module that didn't work on the dell g15).that way, since both worked on lenovo, it doesn't seem to be a hardware problem. however, i don't understand how the two memories have the same settings (both 16gb and 3200mhz and compatible with the specifications of the dell g15), and only one of them works on the dell g15, while on the lenovo both work. could someone please help me with this problem?working in a lenovo system does not guarantee compatibility with a dell which are very picky regarding ram compatibility. judging by your testing procedure it is likely the one ram module has a compatibility problem.  crucial ram can be returned for replacement as per their warranty information at their site here.i'm having the same issue on a dell g15 5515 ryzen 7 5800h with rtx 3060.i also have a dell g15 5511 with intel i7 11800h rtx 3060.on dell g15 with intel i7 11800h i have 2 adata memories, 2x32gb (64gb) working perfectly. i removed them of this laptop and inserted them on dell g15 with ryzen 7 5800h and they don't work together.when i insert only 1 adata memory of 32gb on the slot b, it works. if i add + 8gb on slot a, it works and i can have 40gb of memory on ryzen 7 5800h. but when i switch the 32gb memory from the slot b to the slot a, the battery light starts to blink (2 amber 4 white), indicating memory or ram failure.i have no idea why only slot b accepts the adata memory. and i also have no clue why both of them works just fine on intel but not on ryzen.i have bios 1.18.0 on intel and bios 1.8.0 on ryzen. please, anyone could help?\n",

      "content:  this is a recent issue i've noticed while watching twitch. 80% of my screen freezes, the rest is a projection of what is actually on screen, but with lines. i can see my mouse on the top of the screen. i thought this not be a display issue, since the display works sometimes. i tried updating both of my graphics drivers, but this did not change anything. i ran an advanced diagnostic, with no fault found. plugging an external monitor to my laptop fixes this issue, but it's pretty annoying to always use a display with a laptop. i've attached picture of the screen. i've attached pictures of the issue, and here is a video of it.

      "content:  hello all,i have been diagnosing a power connect 6248 for the past couple weeks now where many devices connected to said switch intermittently drop packets. some devices work without drops but others flip flop between dropping and not. i am fairly certain the issue is with the switch since using a separate small switch between two dropping machines fixed the issue. at this point i am open to any sort of suggestions or help.the switch is connected in a stack normally but for testing purposes i have just the one switch running.below is any logs/configs that i believe to be

      "content:  hello,i have a dell g15 gaming laptop. i've had this laptop for over a year and a half now. just this week i've started to notice that the d key on my laptop is unresponsive at times. this is most noticeable during gaming when i am using wasd for movement. my character will get stuck and not move to the right. this is very frustrating and gets me killed sometimes when it happens at the worst moment.i've removed the key and cleaned out any dust and debris buildup, but this issue is still persisting. it doesn't occur when i am typing, but it seems to be affected by frequent pressing of the w and s keys during gameplay movement. i've also tried exiting a game while the issue is happening, and it does persist for awhile but then fixes itself and the d key is responsive again. i once had to mash d 14-15 times just to get it to type the letter one time after closing out a game. i want to add that the entirety of my time typing this post, the d key has been normal and responsive.i have tested this across multiple games and it is certainly not a particular game issue, especially considering that it does happen when typing after gaming. what could be causing this issue? if i have cleaned the keyboard properly, what else can i do to try to fix this? i really don't want to resort to buying an additional keyboard or use a controller all the time. any advice would be greatly appreciated.check if the keys are stuck on keyboard. another step you can try is to check the keyboard functionality in safe mode and see if it exhibits the same behavior there as well.restart the computer.tap the f8 key on the keyboard during the boot process until you see the windows advanced options menu on the screen.select “safe mode with networking” from the menu using the arrow keys on the keyboard and then press the <enter> key.select the user account at the log in screen.try using your computer and see if the issue persists there. in case of keyboard, you may also try using a usb keyboard and see if it works. if issue persists, remove the usb keyboard and use an onscreen keyboard to see if the issue persists with that as well. to use on screen keyboard:choose start/windows logo → control panel → ease of access → ease of access center.click the start on-screen keyboard button.test out the on-screen keyboard input in any application where you can enter text.click options, select the turn on numeric key pad check box, and then click ok.open a notepad and try typing on that by clicking on the keys of on screen keyboard.\n",

      "content:  blue screen as soon as i try to install support assist. found few threads for resolution for intel boards. what for ryzen boards?as you 'd learnt, install and update incorrectly could cause serious problem to your machine.  here is dell support assist and resource for your machine drivers.similar to your installation choices, you posted in optiplex desktops forum.  requesting mods to move it to laptop section and it may get better support from g15 machines owners.you did not mention if you removed supportassist. it's not a required (or particularly useful) piece of software.have you tried living without it? support assist is important. it is what you need to update dell drivers. windows update only gets important dell drivers like bios type important drivers. any other driver normally doesn't show up at all in windows update not even in windows update > advanced options > optional updates. usually the only way to get it to show up there is by downloading the .exe file to install the driver. even doing that doesn't give you a 100% guarantee that the driver will show up there. any and all dell drivers for your device that need updating can be found and updated using support assist.\n",

      "content:  hello guys,i have a g15 5520(i7 12700h+3070ti) setup with lg 27gp83b external monitor using type-c to displayport cable.so, the problem is, when i am running games like forza horizon 5, it is fine and i am getting around 100fps with max graphics settings. however, csgo is getting just 80-120fps which is really surprising since i was getting around 400fps using hdmi cable with the same monitor.i did some search around and i think the problem is the way thunderbolt is wired to intel integrated graphics. my guess is that since the graphics have to go through both dgpu and igpu, somehow lowered the efficiency and dropped the framerate. so i used afterburner and checked gpu and cpu usage during gameplay, and it turned out that dgpu is running just around 30% but cpu temperature is maxed all the time. my question is, is there a way to deal with the detour so i can load more work to dgpu?  i've tried 1. turn off hybrid graphics in bios. 2. nvidia control panel manual setting for csgo. 3. disable intel graphics adapter(just killed the thunderbolt connection)also, since forzahorizon is running just fine, i was thinking if it is also a problem with directx. forza is running under dx12 while csgo is running under dx9. thanks!\n",

      "content:  i bought a dell g15 5520 (the retailer says it is the g55201800u model). it has rtx 3060, i7 12700h and 120 hz display. i have a few very important questions. unfortunately my research wasn't enough and i learned some stuff after i ordered the laptop, now i can't open its box because i may have to return it.- they say the pc has no second ssd slot and has no slot for an hdd, but i need a pc with large amount of storage. can i replace its ssd with a 2 tb ssd? will i be able to use all of its capacity?- is the rtx 3060 in it a max-q variant? what is its tdp? (the thing they show with \"w\")- does it have advanced optimus feature?- does it have a mux switch? if it has and i disable the intel igpu, will there be an issue when i connect a monitor to its hdmi port?- is disabling the intel igpu in bios considered mux switch and does it increase nvidia gpu performance?- someone on the internet said that the screen of his g15 5520 stopped working after he disabled the igpu in bios. if i do that will my screen stop working too?thank you.- is the rtx 3060 in it a max-q variant? what is its tdp? (the thing they show with \"w\")it's not listed as maxq, and dell does not generally publish the power rating of the gpu. - does it have advanced optimus feature?it should, yes.- does it have a mux switch? if it has and i disable the intel igpu, will there be an issue when i connect a monitor to its hdmi port?no, it does not - it's muxless. - is disabling the intel igpu in bios considered mux switch and does it increase nvidia gpu performance?see above;  the system is software-switchable, not hardware/firmware. - someone on the internet said that the screen of his g15 5520 stopped working after he disabled the igpu in bios. if i do that will my screen stop working too?there's no point in trying, since the system will not function without the intel gpu (the nvidia gpu is a co-processor).if you are looking for a notebook with a true, discrete gpu, they're available in most alienware and precision models, and on the rtx-equipped xps 17 and some ryzen systems.  that is not what this system is, though.  thanks for the reply. since it has only one ssd slot, if i replace its ssd with a 2 tb ssd will it work properly?is its power adapter 180 w or 240 w? like i mentioned, my model has rtx 3060, i7 12700 and 120 hz display.the adapter power rating will be listed on the table (or the current and voltage will be;  just multiply the two). there's no reason a  2t drive won't work fine. \n",

      "content:  the biggest piece of baby dump i’ve ever purchased. bought a dell g15 5511 6 months ago and i’ve encountered several problems with this. the first 2 weeks of owning the laptop and the screen malfunctions and died, sent it out to repair and got it back 3 weeks later. 2 months it ran without a problem and then it decides to die and not turn on. sent it out to repair once again and got it back 2 weeks later, replaced the motherboard. not even a day later it died again so i had to send it back out and repair and they did the exact same thing so it died again. this took about 1 month total. got it back and it ran 1 month without a problem then the hinge broke, sent it out to repair, it took 1 month for them to fix this screen. got it back and 3 days later it doesn’t turn on. i’m fed up with this, they won’t give me back my money and i’m just stuck in this loop of returning it back and getting it broken 2 days later. \n",

      "content:  hello,i'm experiencing an issue with my laptop. when unplugged, the computer will turn off by itself apparently at random or when the screen is closed. sometimes the computer can be running on battery perfectly fine, but when the adapter is inserted it shuts down. the issue arises when the computer is running on battery for a significant time, but not at a particular amount of power usage; it's occurred once at 60% capacity, and once at 80%. when this problem occurs, sometimes the computer can be rebooted when plugged in. in this state, the system will run as long as the charger is connected. however, the battery does not charge, and trying to run power-intensive programs like video games or autocad causes the computer to turn off. when it's in this state. other times it cannot, and it is necessary to disconnect the battery and drain all power from the system before reconnecting and replugging. this fixes the issue, allowing the battery to charge properly and allowing intensive applications to be run. attempted fixes:battery check via powercfg returns normal results.swapping out adapter for new dell-brand adapter has provided no appreciable change.removing battery and purging system of flea power has provided a temporary fix, but the issue returns soon after. thank you\n",

      "content:  hi guys, at some point a week ago, my laptop starts to sleep/hibernate in the evening after i finish work. in the morning, i can't wake him up. to start i must turn it off after pushing the power button for ~20 seconds, and then push on the power button again to start windows normally, but this is not cool at all. i don't want my laptop to go sleep/hibernate, i keep laptop on ac power and only set display to turn off (nothing more).i got latest updates on windows, latest downloaded/installed dell drivers, i changed settings in bios, changed settings in power configuration plan - but after all that my laptop still go to sleep/hibernate (i still don't know which is the right one).if you have any idea how i can stop the laptop to go sleep/hibernate or turn off, i will be very glad to know.thanks in advance!pp if you think any logs, settings or anything is on my side - just say and i will reply with them. \n",

      "content:  i've had my g15 5510 since june 2021. i'm happy with the performance but i've run into an issue.i've had the laptop set to dell's adaptive power mode, running from wall power when i'm gaming and the battery when i'm not. according to the bios and dell power manager my battery health is excellent, but when i generate a windows battery report or check hwinfo64 they both say i've lost around 30% of my battery capacity which doesn't sound excellent! is that normal battery wear for a gaming laptop after 17 months? does anyone know what level of wear is required for the bios or power manager to change from excellent battery health?i've switched to custom battery settings and set it to start charging at 50% and stop charging at 80% so will see if that makes a difference but doubt it in the long run.pics of the battery reports -hwinfo64windows battery reportdell power manager      depending on use and number of charge cycles the battery will last somewhere between 2 and 4 years. dell support page here states 18 - 24 months. so a 30% loss in 17 months is about right and that would be around 3 years or so lifetime. again a lot depends on how heavy a use and the amount of charge cycles which is usually around 1000 charges.thanks, at least i know it's normal wear and not a problem. i actually spoke to dell technical support and asked where to buy a new battery because it's not listed on the parts page. they said it's not for general sale and because power manager says excellent health they can't sell me one. doesn't fill me with confidence for when i need to replace it.the best place to buy genuine dell oem parts, including batteries, is at the parts-people site here.dell battery & adapter shop: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/partsbytype/batteryselector sells only for some models.if dell doesn't have it, the next most reliable place is parts-people. i see that parts-people has genuine dell batteries for your model.  thanks for the links. the only problem with parts-people is that i'm in the uk. it says batteries can only be shipped by ground methods and if shipped by air there is a dangerous goods surcharge. that makes it $87 for shipping and $227 in total, not sure if i'd have to pay import duty or taxes as well. does anyone know a uk based supplier of of genuine parts? if not i suppose i'll just have to pay it when it needs replacing. \n",

dell mobile connect 3.3, bing wallpaper, realtek he audio universal service and windows security notification icon. aside from the browser, the services that are taking up the most memory usage are windows driver foundation - user mode driver framework host process and antimalware service executable.when running the video, cpu is at 13%, mem 50%, disk 0%, gpu 10%. on the latitude, cpu 16%, mem 39%, disk 0%, gpu 39%. i realize the inspiron has 12gb memory while the latitude has 16gb but, the inspiron has the intel iris which gets much better benches than the latitude's uhd620.here are some specs:inspiron 5502/5509619-ahcq : windows 10 home english555-bgcc : wireless driver for 9462/ax201part number description quantity8vgk0 srv,drvr,wifi,9462/ax201,mtln5 19hjv9 srv,drvr,bt,9462/ax201,mbtgln5 1555-bftf : intel(r) wi-fi 6 ax201 (2x2) w i-fi + bluetoothpart number description quantityjtygj lbl,reg,wrles,ax201,ww,bc 1xvv0p crd,wrles,m.2,intel,ax201,new 1490-bggr : intel(r) iris(r) xe graphics w ith shared graphics memorypart number description quantityw21jj info,gnrc,oem,tracking,pn 1400-bger : 512gb m.2 pcie nvme solid stat e drivepart number description quantity2hmfm info,c drive,pciessd 18c3cp ssdr,512g,p34,30s3,toshiba,bg4 1370-affy : 12gb, 8gb+4gb, ddr4, 3200mhzpart number description quantity6vdx7 dimm,8gb,3200,1rx8,8g,ddr4,ns 1cdt82 dimm,4gb,3200,1rx16,8g,ddr4,ns 1338-bwxd : 11th generation intel(r) core( tm)i5-1135g7 processor (8mb ca che, up to 4.2 ghz)part number description quantity6gm80 assy,base,nbk,i5-1135g7,u,mn5t 1cntvp assy,spkr,3204,2514,mkb15 1 latitude 5400619-ahkn : windows 10 pro english, french , spanish555-beum : driver for qualcomm® qca61x4a 802.11ac dual band (2x2) wirel ess adapter+ bluetooth 4.2part number description quantity8mkj5 srv,html,wrles,61x4a 1yh2fc srv,drvr,wrles,61x4a,ntb 1555-bcmw : qualcomm(r) qca61x4a 802.11ac dual band (2x2) wireless adapt er, bluetooth 5.0part number description quantityd4v21 crd,wrles,m.2,qca61x4a,ww 115t2f lbl,reg,wrles,61x4a,ww,m2,bc 1400-bdxg : m.2 256gb pcie nvme class 35 s olid state drivepart number description quantitycyhfx scr,m2x3,d4.5,flh,mscr,ccrmf 4kjk50 frm,ssd,m2,sata/pcie,nb-all 107hmh hldr,a,2230 ssd,5400/5500/3540 185j62 plt,ssd,m.2,pcie,thrm,nb-all 12hmfm info,c drive,pciessd 1fwjtg ssdr,256g,p34,30s3,toshiba,bg4 1379-bdlc : i5-8365u processorpart number description quantityw21jj info,gnrc,oem,tracking,pn 1370-aecx : 8gb, 1x8gb, ddr4 non-eccpart number description quantityhyxpx dimm,8gb,2666,1rx8,8g,ddr4,s 1338-brmf : intel core i5-8365u processor with integrated intel uhd 620 graphicspart number description quantity3wm4c pwa,pln,t,uma,vi5-8365u,5400 1mxh2w fan,u type cpu,uma,5400/5402 1xyg4c assy,htsnk,u,uma,w/o fan,540x 1vmg7f tray,usim,lte mb,wlan/wan,540x 1x84r8 srv,sw,os,pwr,mgmt,e10 1 curious to see if anyone has thoughts on why there is such a big difference in performance between the 2 and what i can do to close the delta. i know the 2 laptops are not exactly identical but, i feel like the inspiron should be outperforming the latitude in graphics processing but the opposite is actually happeninglatitude is a more powerful business computer which is better than an inspiron. thanks for the response. i'm curious if you know something i don't about the latitude being \"more powerful.\" the latitude has 4gb more memory, sure. but the inspiron processor in the specs gets better bench against the latitude processor. the inspiron gpu is significantly better. i'm having trouble finding specifically where this particular latitude's specs are better than this particular inspiron's specs. from what i've sen on paper, the inspiron should be outperforming the latitude but the opposite is actually happening. it's bafflingif i can find precisely what about the latitude is better, i can purchase that hardware to improve the performance. but the inspiron already has better hardware so i'm confusedafter troubleshooting for several hours with drivers, etc, i finally reset to factory defaults. the first video test had good quality but, there were still minor performance issues. now, the problem has returned only 1 day after being reimaged. i can disconnect the inspiron from everything (only running display on the inspiron screen), connect the latitude to one of the monitors (running display to the latitude screen and the lg monitor), run the same video at the same time on both laptops and the latitide still outperforms the inspiron. this doesn't make sense. something is wrong. the inspiron has better hardware across the board with the exception of the amount of memory which shouldn't be an issue because running one video with almost nothing running in the background is not coming close to maxing out the memory.video on the inspiron not only has low quality but, significant judder. very choppy.can i get someone from dell to respond. something is not right with the laptop and i suspect it's the display hardware.\n",

      "content: i have an inspiron 7620 2-in-1 and the recommended active pen pn5122w. it works for a few minutes after restarting the laptop, then just stops being detected by the screen. the battery in the pen is brand new and i have tested it and confirmed the battery has full power.i have looked at dell peripheral manager but it does not have any option to manage a pen available (despite what the user-guide says).i have tried an alternative dell pen that i normally use on another dell laptop, and it does the same: it is detected by the 7620 for a few minutes, then stops until the laptop is rebooted.after the pen stops working on the 7620, i am still able to use it with my other dell laptop with no problems (latitude 7400).this suggests to me that the problem is very clearly on the laptop, not the pen.unless i can get this working more reliably, i will have to return the pen as it's useless like this.solved!go to solution.it wasn't the battery, and this pen doesn't pair via bluetooth.with help from dell support, i found the solution, which was to install the latest intel and nvidia graphics drivers.view solution in original postensure that the coin cells battery holder is tightened firmly into the top cap. top button stops working. pen is not paired correctly with the device. remove the pen from the bluetooth list in the device and pair it again.it wasn't the battery, and this pen doesn't pair via bluetooth.with help from dell support, i found the solution, which was to install the latest intel and nvidia graphics drivers.i have the same problem as you. could you let me know how to check if i need to update the drivers and how i can do it, please?go to the support page for the laptop, find the display drivers, and reinstall the latest versions. don't check whether you \"need\" to - my system said i did not need updates, but reinstalling the drivers did the trick. then come back here and let people know if it worked for you!what specific drivers?? i just reinstalled the nvidia drivers dated 6.10.22 and the problem persists.  the pen works for a few minutes and quits.  the device status in peripheral manager shows that the battery is 100% (it's about a month old and tests at 1.6v) and has been in a drawer for most of that time.  any help? here are the specifics on the driver:version: 30.0.15.1274, a01file name: nvidia-geforce-mx-550-570-and-rtx-2050-3050-3050_ymkf0_win_30.0.15.1274_a01.exethe problem goes away (temporarily) even if i just put the computer to sleep. i installed the latest nvidia driver dated 7/21/22 with version 31.0.15.1694 and the problem repeated itself after using the pen for about half an hour.  very frustrating...i am also facing this issue with my dell inspiron 7620 2in1. i am already in contact with dell support since the release of this laptop (over three months now) and the issue is still not fixed!i have already talked with many dell technicians over phone and in person. the issue could be narrowed down to a hardware issue which affects all dell inspiron 7620 2in1 (at least with the same hardware specifications as mine). with the dell technicians we have ruled out any software issues by reinstalling windows, updating drivers etc. --> this rules out software issues, so the pen issues must be hardware related (either the pen or the laptop).after that i got in total 6 different pen/stylus replacements (three times dell pen pn5122w and three times dell penn pn7522w). non of them worked for a longer period on my dell inspiron 7620 2in1 system. but all of theses pens do work flawlessly on another dell latitude system which i own. --> this rules out hardware issues on the pens themselves.then the dell technician has already replaced hardware components of my system. he replaced the screen (including the digitizer), some cabling inside the system and now even the motherboard. --> but the pen issues persists.after that i have got a 1 to 1 replacement and received a completely new laptop, which i could test after a few minutes had also the same pen issues. --> this would indicate that all dell inspiron 7620 2in1 system are affected by these hardware issues and that they can not work without issues with a pen for a prolonged period of time.until now i do not have a solution for my pen issues, and my system is not useable as a convertible with pen support. that is absolutely not acceptable for such a expensive device.\n",

      "content: hi team, i recently installed intel wifi 6e ax210 on my i5 11 gen. the hotspot worked fine on driver version 12.150.x.x but after updating to 12.180.x.x, it stopped working. on my iphone, the hotspot suddenly disconnects and there is a lot of hustle to reconnect. moreover, the issue persits even after updating to newset 12.190.x.x. the hotspot disconnects after some time. it happens when its utilizing 802.11ax mode. on 802.11ac it buys more time but still disconnects. kindly help.the processor is its dell inspiron 15 3000, 11th gen intel(r) core(tm) i5-1135g7 @ 2.40ghz 2.42 ghz and it's all running on windows 11 pro.i just put my system in your configuration.  i will keep an eye on it but could the hotspot disconnects be due to your host system going into a low power state?hello, well, even if host system goes into low power mode, it should automatically wake up or receive and send data for background services at least. it just shuts off, like the button is pressed on but its says 0/8 devices connected with hotspot with my phone showing wifi icon connected to hotspot but no data transfer. it is pretty weird. the laptop is inspiron 15 3000 and mobile is iphone 13 pro max. i would appreciate if someone finds out what could go wrong. it works fine while connected to any modem/router. only mobile hotspot issue.if your hotspot won't work, ensure the internet works and you're entering the right password. you can also try disabling battery saver or low power mode or restarting your phone's wi-fi. if your phone's hotspot still won't work, then tethering or turning the phone on and off might help.bro tried all, it just turns off in the middle of the connection. it just turns off in the middle of nowhere. seems there might be issue in the driver. here is a link to couple threads with the same issue. but things should be clear from dell and intel both for smooth working.https://community.intel.com/t5/wireless/ax210-driver-22-180-x-x-problem-mobile-hotspot-mode/td-p/143...https://community.intel.com/t5/wireless/wi-fi-hotspot-issue-intel-ax210/m-p/1443896/emcs_t/s2h8zw1ha... i hope all the issues clear out. if anyone can check any issues from dell, i would highly appreciate.  i have an iphone x and, as far as i can tell, the wi-fi drivers have not affected the connection, but i don't use it like you do.  since, in your links the newer drivers seem but be involved, i suppose all you can do is roll it back.  if it asks why, give it the incompatible drivers response.i left it all day and the only time it switched to another network was when the host computer was asleep or off.  i think it did go back to the hotspot when i woke it up.  i am wondering if there is something that keeps the host computer from going to sleep or low power mode, which the hotspot is active.the hotspot seems to indicate only 8 devices can be connected.do you leave the lid on the host system open or maintain it orientation to the wi-fi signal?and i just noticed something else.  my system will show around 2300 mbps receive and transmit rates on the router.  if i turn on the mobile hotspot, the receive rate drops to 6 mbps.  the host system is using the 6 ghz radio to communicate with the router and the hotspot is using the 5 ghz radio.the bizarre part is when i roll back to the older drivers on a 200mbps connection, i can't  get more than 15 mbps on my iphone with laptop \"mobile hotspot\". as soon as i upgrade the drivers, the hotspot then keeps with the actual internet speed.well the lid is always open, all the problems are during laptop awake. like you are working on your laptop with mobile hotspot on and all of a sudden this bizarre behaviour starts. my phone switches to mobile data because the hotspot does not work.even for this low power thing, we don't want this level of power saving  well,  how can the transmit rate drop from 6 ghz to 5 ghz band. it's all just not making sense. this issue of yours is a bit similar to the speed drop issue on old drivers.you can do nothing on a 6 mbps transmit rate. did you try connecting with 5ghz? also, they haven't yet enabled 6ghz hotspot band on laptops. they should btw or maybe there are not so many common mobiles equipped with 6e system.i had my phone on a mobile hotspot sponsored by a dell laptop, for several hours yesterday and i saw no disconnects that were noticeable.it appears, the dropping to 6 mbps might be a glitch on my axe16000 router since the hosting system shows normal speeds.  the mobile hotspot seemed to be stable. in case i misunderstood, is your phone dropping the connection to the hotspot or is the hotspot dropping the connection to your router, which causes the phone to disconnect?  and you have no other networks your phone can connect to when it loses the hotspot?i have one more system which is a modern standby system so i will try that today.  it is, however, a win 10 system.my modern standby system did drop the hotspot when it went into low power mode.  when i tapped the space bar, it did come back with almost no effort.what i might suggest now is to start timing certain events against what power settings you have for the system.   i still do not have a guess as to why the newer drivers would cause you problems.  my modern standby is an older system that uses the 22.70.x.x driver version.i am using my systems for music/video streaming only.   i have no experience with utilities that use two way audio, such as teams or skype.well, we'll have to wait for the improvements. also i updated the windows version to 22h2. still no improvements on the hotspot issue. turns out i have to manually reconnect wifi from my iphone to work. that may a low power mode issue. but is should just wake up and function normally.all the settings are on default except the \"preferred band\" which is set to 6ghz. even setting it to default does not make any difference.\n",

      "content: i purchased this laptop for its functionality back in september 2021 and have been satisfied since. about a month ago, the laptop started making clicking noises at the hinge when opening the display but i brushed this off as a normal issue and didn't think much about it.yesterday, when i was opening my laptop, the hinge broke and in the process cracked the glass display. as a careful user this was very unexpected since i have always trusted dell for its reliability of its products (my 7.5 year old dell inspiron is still running to this day). when i contacted dell support, i was disappointed to learn that it would take almost 4 weeks to replace the broken parts and that it may not be covered under warranty.would really appreciate if dell was able to loan a laptop in the meantime or replace my laptop with a working one. 4 weeks is way too long for replacement of parts and i expected a fast fix. definitely disappointed in the service.upon further research, i learnt that this is a common issue for dell laptops due to the lack of calibration for the hinge when it was manufactured, resulting in excessive force needed to open the laptop and hence leading to issues like this. dell should consider changing their design or use better materials for the hinge problem.this is identical to my issue. they scheduled next day repair followed by emails stating parts are not available.i have experienced a similar problem. i bought my laptop in october 2021 and have encountered endless problems with it. most recently the right side hinge started creaking and at a closer look the screen had started popping out. i contacted dell and sent my laptop in for a repair which they said would take 12 working days. it has been 12 working days and i had not received any updates. i called dell today and they informed me that the required part is not available until the 15th november and a replacement laptop would also take 2-3 weeks to arrive. what am i meant to do? i cannot work without my laptop and it will have been 6 weeks by the end and that is if i receive it by thena closer view the right hinge has the trouble. i bought this laptop from dell india in january 2022. now i am in sri lanka, my home country. this hinge was damaged despite my very careful handling of it. dell india said i have to apply online for a warranty transfer. however, my application was rejected twice during the last one and half months. after a hectic triumph, i was able to find the dell sri lanka authorities. i don't know what will happen in the coming weeks. my warranty is expiring next january (2023).\n",

      "content: so, i have a inspiron 7306 laptop. all was working great, but i wanted to give it to a family member. i tried to do a fresh windows install within windows. it didn't appear to work and instead loads windows & brings me back to the login screen. however,  it is now not accepting my password. at this point, my only option seems to do a fresh install from a usb drive.i created the media on a usb drive from the microsoft website. when i boot my inspiron into the usb drive and start to go through the windows installation setup, i am getting the following screen (below) telling me \"it couldn't find any drives\" for the windows installation.i know the drive works as it will still boot up fine (but can't login) so its not damaged. any idea how to fix this in order to do a fresh reinstall from the usb?    i suspect that your hard drive has gpt partition scheme.your usb flash drive was probably created to install windows on a hard drive with mbr partition scheme.  ok, any idea how to fix this so it shows up and i can continue to do a fresh windows install? do i need to use another method for installing windows? should i download a different version to my usb stick? just wondering how to continue with the installthis page at easeus describes how to change a disk from gpt to mbr. it also has a link to partition manager which is used to perform that function. aomei partition assistant here can also be used for that purpose.ok, any idea how to fix this so it shows up and i can continue to do a fresh windows install? do i need to use another method for installing windows? should i download a different version to my usb stick? just wondering how to continue with the installthe 7306 is just a year old. you don't want to be converting it to mbr.https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windows-10-usb-bootable-media-uefi-supporti've got the same issue with my 7610: by default, your disk uses intel's rapidshare technology (raid).either you disable the raid mode in your bios or you download the rapidshare driver, extract it in your windows usb drive and load the drivers (you can see it in your screenshot)insert in your target system your dell recovery usb key. power up and immediately press f12 to show bios boot menu. select under uefi boot: the uefi: dell recovery usb selection. follow the dell recovery usb process.hi @mfranch87 i also faced the same problem and consulted dell about this. they provided the below .exe file and guide to sort this matter. i haven't tried yet but i feel it is a potential solution. try this and let us know if it solves the matter. snip of dell's reply is attached.link driver: https://dl.dell.com/folder08107263m/3/intel-rapid-storage-technology-driver_xw8pp_win64_19.2.0.1003_...link guide: https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-au/000132969/how-to-load-intel-rapid-storage-technology-driver...<image removed due to privacy concerns. tos76> \n",

      "content: i bought a dell g15 5515 ryzen edition for gaming and it worked fine for 1 month, then it started to black screen and occasionally blue screens and then restarts. i made sure to check for all the updates. now just launching a game (eg: path of exile, torchlight 3, guild wars) it instantly crashes and restarts. recently if i open 2 or more youtube videos it crashes..... i know this computer is powerful and should be able to run much more hardware taxing games with ease.hi jabismas!what error message do you get on the blue screens? is it always the same or a different one.can you maybe take a look at the windows event viewer and check what exactly is happening and if it shows a critical event or something like that with a specific error number and so on?did you install hwmonitor and check the temperatures with your unit? from what i see in the service manual - it has two fans and a decent heat-pipe installed - from a analytical perspective i would like to nail down whetever youre having a driver / bios / incompability related kind of error, or maybe a unit getting too hot and causing a crash. did you replace the stock ssd and ram modules with something new, or did you keep the original configuration? i got the same problem here, already reset it then 1 month after i got blue screen again while opening chrome and youtube, but while playing the game freeze, it always happen every 4 days.trying sfc , chdsk, dism online repair none of it repair the laptop, already check via dell hardware check no problem at all. if ur location close with dell service center then take it to them, if not then u should try reset it but probably u will get same freezing again.sorry if my english bad i hope u understandthanks for posting.  apologies that your system is not working as expected.freezing issues can be difficult to troubleshoot and diagnose.  please try running a systems diagnostics by pressing f12 at startup or by running dell support assist.  make a note of any error messages and contact tech support for further troubleshooting and possible resolution.  you can contact tech support at 1-800-624-9896  or 1-800-288-4410, or you can initiate a chat session http://dell.to/2v4snvmhi, sorry for taking so long to respond. finally got my old laptop back up and running (slow as heck tho). the blue screen was always the same error message. \"we have encountered an error and are sending necessary data back\"....would load to 100% and restart. as for cooling i thought this was the case after it did it the first time so i got a cooling pad (which helped for a while) and it's been on it ever since.  recently changed the ssd and was able to roll back to windows 10 (did a full system wipe). booted up did all the updates except for upgrading to 11 again. and it looked as if the problem was solved until i did a system scan and it instantly blue screen. rebooted and  not even staying on a minute before crashing again. mid updates, scans, it just crashes again. at a lost as to what to do now.good day, at this point the laptop isn't staying on long enough to do anything without crashing. tried running dell support, scan disk, etc. and as the scan started it would crash. at one point it blue screened while rebooting....i gave up at that point. afraid to do anything bios related right now because of the crashes and there isn't a dell service center anywhere near my region.i have similar issues too with my g15 laptop. in my case, rather than getting a blue screen, the monitor just goes black.when it gets to that state, i can’t turn it off/on, hard reset, nothing works. i end up needing to leave it off the power plug for a while until it suddenly starts working again after plugging in. (i’m assuming i have to wait until the battery is fully drained/dead)the last few times it happened, i just had to test that process daily until it would work usually around a week later. it now just happened again this morning. i’ve had many laptops before and never had an issue like this. it’s very weird and i haven’t been able to find a pattern for when it happens.hi there. i have a g15 and it's only photoshop that freezes after about 30 seconds - windows11 everything (including all drivers) up to date.this is sound weird but i am also facing same issues from past one year since i have bought the laptop. trust me its the worst decision i made. the laptop is super impressive at specs but when used it cant even handle simple video play. it even freezes if i scan through my video folders. so basically off late the screen just froze whenever i play anything or work with videos. only option i left is always to hard boot it. many calls and tickets with dell didn't solved the issue. i cant even give it back as i have moved out of us (but it was additional international warranty) . so basically i bought a laptop which has freezing problem by design and i am learning to live with it! \n",

      "content: i've just bought an inspiron 16 plus 7620. it comes with a usb-c power adapter even though it also has a round pin dc plug. there is only one usb-c port so this is wasted if used to power the laptop. much better to use the round pin dc plug which is also better located closer to the back of the laptop so away from usb cable congestion.it seems nuts to me that dell supply the usb-c power adapter as standard, but am i missing something? is there some reason why it is worth wasting the usb-c port for power supply?i want a second power adapter with a round pin so that i don't need to waste the usb-c port but there isn't one listed on the dell website that is compatible? does anyone know of a suitable dell power adapter?all new systems are trending toward usb-c power only -- and many who use docking stations power the systems that way.it is true that some systems draw more power than usb-c can deliver (these usually have high performance discrete gpus and/or power hungry uhd screens).  you can easily use a standard dell adapter with a 4.5 mm plug if your system has the barrel jack.this adapter will work fine.https://www.parts-people.com/index.php?action=item&id=19684 there is literally no advantage as far as performance comes type c charger though long last, at there are no moving components, as the port is on the motherboard itself. dc in port however is a separate part and can become loose after a few years of usages. i agree you should have regular charger , unless you are buying a docking station which can charge the machine.  https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-slim-power-adapter-130-watt-with-1m-power-cord/apd/332-1829/pc-...  it makes no sense for dell to supply a usb-c power adapter as standard.here in the uk the only power adapter available like the one you suggest is this one:https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/dell-uk-ireland-130-watt-3-prong-ac-adapter-45mm-with-1meter-power-c... i'm fairly sure it is suitable for use with the inspiron 16 plus 7620 but it is not listed under compatible products and when someone asked the question dell replied \"this product is not suitable for a dell inspiron 7620 plus\".i think this is misleading and that dell are driving customers in to wasting their usb-c port for charging instead of using the correct round pin dc plug.@peterc65  there are many who prefer type c charging over anything.  anyways i will suggest go to an authorized dell retailer connect the charger to machine and see if it charges, also boot in bios (f2) and ensure charger is detected as 130w. if it works pay and if it doesn't don't. also dell uk has a 30 day return facility so you buy the charger from there you will  have ample amount of time to test.  one more thing , never listen to sales whether dell or any other company. they read from a manual completely agreed with you that, from a customer's standpoint, it makes no sense for dell to supply a usb-c power adapter as a standard for this notebook, which has only 1 usb-c port. i would not care much about this issue if this notebook were to have at least 1 usb 3.2 gen 2 usb-a port. but no, we are talking about 2022, and dell gave us 2 usb-a ports that are fancily called usb 3.2 gen 1, but basically are just usb 3.0 ports with up to 5.0 gb/s data transfer rate. because of that, any user with a fast external ssd (such as the samsung or sandisk ssds that have at least 1000 mb/s transfer rate) would want to use the thunderbolt/usb-c port for fast data transfer instead of for charging the notebook. don't tell me to \"temporarily remove the usb-c charging cable from the usb-c port anytime you need to connect your fast external ssd to your notebook.\" heck, for my storage-intensive applications, i may need to have a fast external ssd connected to my notebook longer than the duration that the notebook's battery can provide (before the battery needs another charge). for those who are not familiar, this thunderbolt 4 port can provide up to 40 gb/s data transfer.so, dell, it is ok to be hip or to lower your cost by providing us with a \"usb-c cabled\"  power adapter as a standard, but please give us another usb-c/thuderbolt-4 port.i've been using the laptop for six months now, using a power supply with a round dc plug. it turns out that any dell power supply with the correct sized plug able to supply at least the same power as is provided by the standard power supply will work just fine.dell eventually sent me two for free, so i now have more power supplies than i can use. their customer support was a lesson in incompetence until eventually, after after several days and dozens of conversations, i was finally put in touch with one of their rare 'capable' support people. i had just needed a mains cable but she showered me with power supplies instead.nuts ! \n",

      "content: what is the maximum ram upgrade in new inspiron 3501  and how many sots available for the same ??since i am buying 4gb ram model is it feasible for ram upgrade.welcome to the dell community @noithatgooccho 16 gb two sodimm slots dells specs.inspiron 3501 setup and specifications:https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/inspiron-15-3501-laptop/inspiron-3501-setup-and-specifica...there is a good chance that 32gb will work but you would need to here that from someone that has tried.best regards,u2my laptop arrives tomorrow and i'm thinking about adding ram.  it is 8gb, i'm thinking of upgrading to 16gb. the support link to my tag says max ram is16gb, it has 2 slots, support says each slot can take up to 16gb.  i don't need 32gb, but would be good to know if it is feasible.will the factory installed ram take up one or 2 slots?  guess i need to know what additional ram i need to buy e.g one 8gb if 8gb already installed or 2 x 8gb is 2 x 4gb are pre-installed.  how can i check this? many thanks  most likely it'll be a single 8g sodimm, but you won't know definitively until you receive the system. in windows task manager, if you click the performance tab it will tell how many slots are in use.hi, you may purchase an 8gb module for 2nd slot if an 8 gb module is already installed. if two module of 4 gb each are installed then you have two options i.e. add 8 gb module by removing on 4 gb module. it will be total 12gb. 2nd remove both 4 gb modules and add one 16gb or two 8gb modules. it will total 16 gb. hello,that is slightly incorrect i mean the amount is correct but for full dual channel ram you need to install 2 sticks of the same brand also note  that dell systems are very picky about the ram they accept and the following brands are known to cause issues : \n",

      "content: hello,i have a dell g15 gaming laptop. i've had this laptop for over a year and a half now. just this week i've started to notice that the d key on my laptop is unresponsive at times. this is most noticeable during gaming when i am using wasd for movement. my character will get stuck and not move to the right. this is very frustrating and gets me killed sometimes when it happens at the worst moment.i've removed the key and cleaned out any dust and debris buildup, but this issue is still persisting. it doesn't occur when i am typing, but it seems to be affected by frequent pressing of the w and s keys during gameplay movement. i've also tried exiting a game while the issue is happening, and it does persist for awhile but then fixes itself and the d key is responsive again. i once had to mash d 14-15 times just to get it to type the letter one time after closing out a game. i want to add that the entirety of my time typing this post, the d key has been normal and responsive.i have tested this across multiple games and it is certainly not a particular game issue, especially considering that it does happen when typing after gaming. what could be causing this issue? if i have cleaned the keyboard properly, what else can i do to try to fix this? i really don't want to resort to buying an additional keyboard or use a controller all the time. any advice would be greatly appreciated.check if the keys are stuck on keyboard. another step you can try is to check the keyboard functionality in safe mode and see if it exhibits the same behavior there as well.restart the computer.tap the f8 key on the keyboard during the boot process until you see the windows advanced options menu on the screen.select “safe mode with networking” from the menu using the arrow keys on the keyboard and then press the <enter> key.select the user account at the log in screen.try using your computer and see if the issue persists there. in case of keyboard, you may also try using a usb keyboard and see if it works. if issue persists, remove the usb keyboard and use an onscreen keyboard to see if the issue persists with that as well. to use on screen keyboard:choose start/windows logo → control panel → ease of access → ease of access center.click the start on-screen keyboard button.test out the on-screen keyboard input in any application where you can enter text.click options, select the turn on numeric key pad check box, and then click ok.open a notepad and try typing on that by clicking on the keys of on screen keyboard.\n",

      "content: hello community,my inspiron 3793 is 2 years old and out of warranty.it worked perfectly fine up until a few days ago, when the space key started to act weird - it only works when i hit it right in the middle, when hit on the left or right side it does nothing. secondly, there is a new and unusual klicking sound when i hit the space key on the left side.i lifted it carefully from the keypad and checked fpr anything broken or some dirt, but it looks perfectly ok.another small issue: sometimes the keyboard seems to react extremely slowly, i.e. i type let`s say 15 characters, which do not appear on the screen, like the system is stuck, and then suddenly they are there.unfortunately, the laptop is used almost exclusively for writing, so without a working space key and sometimes slow reaction time it is extremely unnerving and almost impossible to use.apparently, the top case (palm rest and keyboard) is not available as a spare part.any suggestions what else i could try to solve the problem?best regards and happy holidayshadalanthe assembly is available for replacement.https://www.parts-people.com/index.php?action=item&id=30417service manual:https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/inspiron-17-3793-laptop/docs hi ejn63,thank you for taking the tima and finding the part. my mistake: i forgot to mention that i need a qwertz  (german) keyboard is it maybe possible to change the relevant keys form the old keyboard to new one? that should work....or maybe just put keyboard stickers on the new keyboard.anyways, thanks a lot, that my solve the problem!happy holidaysmarc open settings by right-clicking on the start menu and choosing settings. next, navigate to system > troubleshoot > other troubleshooters > keyboard (run). this will pop up a troubleshooting wizard that might alleviate the issue.\n",

      "content: does anyone know if my dell inspiron 5570 laptop has a hdd?  my c drive is almost full (my c drive only has storage space of 223gb) i want to increase my storage space to either 1tb or 2tb.  however i have no idea what to buy.  any help would be much appreciated.  you can see whether you have a hdd or ssd by opening windows disk defragmenter (in start menu, start typing \"defrag\" and the application name should appear for you to click on it). in the optimize drives window that appears, the column \"media type\" will state whether you have \"hard disk drive\" or \"solid state drive\".here is what dell's specifications say that your system supports: any m.2 pcie drive will be faster than a sata drive. you can choose any size, up to 4 tb. you are not limited to the sizes listed in the specifications, as those are just what dell tested several years ago when the laptop was designed.follow the disassembly and reassembly steps in dell's service manual.look on youtube for videos showing disassembly of your model. but, be cautious with them, as some use steps or methods that are not appropriate. use the videos to add to your understanding of what to do, but follow the steps in dell's manual.whenever touching components or working inside a computer, wear a grounded wrist strap, also called anti-static wrist strap, esd wrist strap, or ground bracelet. it's a cheap and sensible precaution. rest the laptop on an anti-static mat or at least a reasonable alternative such as corrugated cardboard.many thanks for your reply.  i have checked and i have ssd.  any ideas what to look for on the internet to increase storage on this laptop?i thought i said. any m.2 drive. if you want highest performance, search for m.2 2280 nvme. that will be faster than a non-nvme pcie drive, which in turn would be faster than a sata drive. you can use any of those, it just depends upon how much performance you want and the price you're willing to pay.you'll find lots of choice of manufacturers and models in any of those categories.seeing that you have a system that accepts both a m.2 and a 2.5\" drive, the easiest solution would be to install a 2.5\" ssd and move your documents over to that drive. if your current drive consists of mainly programs and apps, then it's best to replace the m.2 drive with something larger rather than installing a 2.5\" drive and using it as secondary storage. this complicates the process a bit, as you first have to back up any personal files and app data that you want to keep, replace the existing m.2 ssd with the new one, and then re-install and set up windows and your programs. you also have the option to clone your existing drive to a new one using a program like macrium reflect free, but that requires a usb adapter of the correct m.2 interface (most only do one or the other) for the second drive that you are cloning to, so if you replace the current drive with a larger nvme m.2 ssd, you need to purchase a usb adapter that supports that interface. once cloning has completed, remove the existing m.2 drive from the laptop and install the new one. if everything went correctly, the new drive should immediately start booting into windows.when purchasing a ssd of any interface or form factor, buy a good name brand to ensure good performance and reliability. samsung (evo or pro series) and crucial (mx series) are usually considered the best. cheaper ones may not perform as well, and may only last a couple years before they start to fail.\n",

i understand that most of the people who post online are those experiencing problems (and not many people post online when an issue is resolved), but could you confirm that dell knows what the issue is and are able to fix it? i've read a lot of posts from inspiron 16 plus users who claim they returned their units to fix this issue, but then got their inspiron 16 plus laptops back with the same issue.i'm not confident it's a software issue because the exact same issue occurs when using linux (and you can see signs of it in the bios when moving the mouse around, although the bios isn't really a good way to test this).it's unacceptable to expect dell inspiron 16 plus users who suffer from this issue to just \"...live with it...\". the clock is still ticking, dell must have been made aware of this issue months ago. i don't know the exact numbers, but there must be hundreds of inspiron 16 plus users suffering from this issue. it's a serious issue - the touchpad is a major component of a laptop, and this issue makes the dell inspiron 16 plus borderline unusable (it's more than just an \"inconvenience\"). i don't think they've been able to solve this problem, as the customer service team hasn't been able to solve this issue for about a month. i understand that it's not up to them and they work according to the instructions the company gives them, but i think that not being able to return with a problem like this is unacceptable. unfortunately, my new laptop has been unusable for a long time now. i am very disappointed with this company and the fact that i gave them my money for nothing.i agree with you, but i didn't pay money to investigate or figure out how to solve this issue, i supposed to use this laptop without facing any problem and in the beginning i though i have a bad luck and i'm the only miserable person who facing this issue. but obviously it's a common issue. dell need to act responsible and solve this issue to all the users we need to get a better service.for me i have nothing to do and i bough an external mouse to be able to use the laptop.i really need a solution because it's a bad indicator that dell aware with this problem and let users to face the problem alone without doing something to solve the issue.it's a very bad experience for me with dell\n",

      "content: hello,i have a dell g3 15 3500 with 1tb of storage (m2 pcie 2230/2280) and tried to add a crucial p3 4tb pcie m.2 2280 ssd in the additional 2280 slot. apparently this slot is limited to 512 gb of storage, i wanted to know why and if there was a way around this? why are slots limited in storage? after scanning my laptop crucial claims the ssd to be compatible with it despite it seeming to be fundamentally unable to host more than 2 tb of storage per slot at best according to specs. it seems to detect the ssd but the laptop just won't boot on the original drive despite me clearly ordering it to boot only on said drive via the bios.and if there is no solution what ca i do of my 4 tb 2280 ssd to atleast make it usable somehow with this pc?i want to add that the laptop is running a uefi compatible firmware so in theory it isn't supposed to have limited storage space unlike legacy firmware.the specs state 512gb for the intel optane not for an ssd. and specs only list the drives dell has tested with the unit, not all the compatible drives. it was not clear from your post if you cloned the 1tb drive to the 4tb drive or if you clean installed windows. if you cloned the drive, remove the old ssd and boot the system and if all looks good then reinstall the old ssd. if you are clean installing, i would recommend pulling the old ssd first and then installing windows. if all looks good, then reinstall the old drive. and crucial specs are accurate, the 4tb ssd is compatible. and make sure that windows boot manager is the first option in the bios boot order.thanks for taking the time to answer me, i appreciate it.sorry if i wasn't clear, it indeed corresponds to the intel optane.i have 2 m2 slots, i already have the 2230 one used by my default 1tb ssd on which the computer boots on, and i tried adding the new 4tb ssd on the other free 2280 slot. when doing that, windows should still boot on the original drive, but doesn't. i tried different boot orders in order to get the computer to boot on the correct drive but i was unsuccessful.i would like to have both the 1tb and 4tb ssds in the computer, with the computer booting on the original drive.i'm back with more info that will hopefully help identify the problem. here is the setup, below under the copper plate is the default 1 tb m2 2280 ssd that came with the laptop, and above is the crucial 4 tb 2280 ssd that i added. here is the boot sequence of the bios :it starts with the boot manager as expected.both ssds are perfectly detected as shown below :you can also see that the boot path is set to \"mbr of disk 1\", disk 1 being the 1 tb original drive. so far so good right? until i actually try to boot the thing : i am stuck in this infinite loop unable to do anything. startup settings won't help, recovery environment brings me back to this very page, and escape opens the bios in which everything seems to be in order.prior to that i was also stuck in an infinite loop of bitlocker asking me a license key, but despite it being correct i was always redirected to this page so i disabled bitlocker altogether for the moment.you stated that the original drive is a 2230 but then stated that under the heatsink is a 2280 1tb. i assume that the 1tb is a 2230 then? if you pull the 4 tb ssd does the system boot normally? is there an os installed on the 4 tb ssd? also have you tried to swap the position of the drives? slot 1 is where the 4tb is now and slot 2 is where the 1tb drive is located.yes i stated 2230 assuming from the default configurations available on the dell website but after checking it turns out that i had a 2280 under the copper plate in slot 1 (fan side) from the beginning. i'll try to swap them. but the 1 tb it definitely a 2280 and has always been in slot 1, i never swapped it.and the 4 tb crucial is completely new it has nothing no os.i swapped the two ssds and it didn't change anything, still the same issue. wish there was a way to tell the pc not to consider the new ssd when searching for boot options... because whenever i disable it the pc just works fine.also here's a pic that didn't upload correctly showing the two ssds being detected correctly by the systemupdate:i bought an orico m2 to usb adapter to read it via my pc, it works just fine i partitioned it in four partitions, the thing is gpt and fully usable via usb, so my ssd isn't faulty, my motherboard port isn't faulty since i swapped my 1tb and it worked just fine.i tried setting up a windows install on a usb drive and boot only on the new 4 tb ssd but the pc seems to endlessly load in the beginning \"dell\" black screen logo. i set in the bios the boot priority to the uefi usb drive with the windows installer on it but it just do'enst work. when replacing the 4 tb by the original ssd, it does boot on the windows usb drive.so to sum up, everything works fine unless this 4 tb ssd is inside the computer. boot order becomes irrelevant, i'm now thinking of some ways of updating the bios perhaps? i don't understand why this perfectly working ssd and my perfectly working computer are just not working together...hey damien - it's entirely possible that there is an issue with this specific p3 drive.please reach out to crucial's technical support for further information and warranty options (please be sure to mention that you have a new p3).https://www.crucial.com/support/contact.\n",

      "content: hi,i just got my new laptop yesterday and i found out that if i leave my laptop in sleep mode for a long period of time, the keyboard area is becoming very hot and when i turn back on the laptop, the fans are just kicking in crazy.i would like to let dell know about this issue, so it can be fixed. normally, in sleep mode, nothing should run, so i don't understand the heating problem. thank you3 things i can tell you:1 - update your bios to the latest version if you haven't already, and also update your nvidia driver to the latest version from nvidia's site, not dell's. i also had this problem, and for a long time i resorted to the 2nd piece of advice that i listed below. recently i reinstalled windows, and found that this problem was completely fixed! the only 2 things i can attribute that to was that i had been updating the bios and also the nvidia drivers. i do remember this problem being noted as a \"known issue\" in the rtx 3050 drivers about a year ago.2 - if the above doesn't work, you need to enable s3 sleep by editing the registry. s0 is enabled by default by microsoft in windows 10 and 11. it just turns off the screen and throttles down the cpu to save power. s3 sleep is a deeper standby mode than s0 sleep, and will actually cut power to the gpu (which is what's running and heating up while your lid is closed). i'd close my laptop lid, and an hour later it would be extremely hot, fans spinning at 100%, and i'd see that the laptop had run some weird uefi-level diagnostic. i actually wrote a post on reddit explaining how to re-enable s3 sleep in windows 10 and 11, the link is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/rzv5l1/xps17_s0_modern_standby_kills_battery_in_9_hours/hry8i...3 - if the above doesn't work, or you don't feel skilled enough to edit the windows registry, you can alway set your power settings to hibernate when you close the lid instead of \"sleep.\" it's less convenient, but will actually save you a little battery power.i hope this helps.  you can press the power button for five seconds, (called a hard shutdown). then reflash the bios–doing this will reset your machine. this technique should avert your dell laptop from overheating. there are also a few other workarounds you can do to get it back to normal operations.i have the rtx 3060. i will try to update the driver from nvidia.i also have the latest bios and windows update.for sleep mode, i will look into that later. i will use hibernate in the meantime.thanks.i have the same exact problem. my brand new dell inspiron 16 plus delivered a few days ago gets very hot in sleep mode near the keyboard and the speaker area. i never faced such a problem with the other brand laptops i had used previously. one would expect that no processes are running in sleep mode and cpu is not much in use. i don't know if this problem is specific to inspiron 16 plus. i installed the bios again to default and re-installed the nividia drivers etc. tech support of dell tried to troubleshoot the problem but i don't think it is helping. dell should investigate and resolve this issue asap.  i want dell to respond to this post.i had that same issues with an dell inspiron 3511. normally when you close the lid the laptop would remain in sleep mode until i open it back as long as the battery isn't low.  when i had it plug in sleep mode the laptop would get extremally hot. when i left it unplugged it goes into hibernate base on the time i set like when you put the laptop to sleep all it does is just turn of the screen. i test it on another 3511 and the next one doesn't have this issues. i even got the board change via warranty after it failed and it was still doing the same. so i'm wondering if it something with lcd ribbon cable or the lid close sensor or switch. i think i found a solution to the problem of overheating of dell inspiron 16 plus. one does not see the \"hibernate\" option in power. one sees only sleep, restart, or shutdown. but one can get the hibernate mode option by going to control panel, advanced options, and enabling hibernate option. after this, one will see hibernate in power. by putting the laptop in hibernate mode instead of sleep mode, i notice that the laptop does not get hot. one can close the lid after this. restarting from hibernate to active mode can be done by opening the lid. try this and let us know if this has helped overheating problem of the laptop when not in use. i had this exact problem on my weeks old 7620 and my solution was the exact opposite of what you are suggesting. basically it is because the laptop goes into hibernate mode after several hours of being in sleep mode and when it does that i was getting the heating with lid closed problem. i resolved it by deactivating hibernate through powershell. now it goes to sleep and stays in sleep until i reopen the lid and i dont have the heating issue anymore.i cant believe that the dell engineers missed this !i have the same problem with a inspiron 16 bought november last year, which seemed to go into a half a sleep mode, keyboud lit up but the machine wouldn't boot up but really worried me. so did a search and found your posts. i'll leave it up to dell to sort it.bought 2 inspirons so this is one of a pair so i guess that will have the same problem when i get round to booting it up.would be good if dell posted on here to tell us they are updating it.\n",

neither internal drive, nor usb sticks.tried two different usb sticks, tried all usb ports, tried to reset bios to default/factory/last known good settings, safe boot on/off.i can boot in legacy mode external drives but that means no secure boot and therefore unable to install windows 11 (unless using rufus and turn off the tpm/secure boot requirements.. and even after that it won't boot from the internal drive).methods attempted:-dell os recovery tool usb drive- windows media creator tool usb drive- rufus and windows 11 iso (uefi)- @philip_yip  usb drive guide. i always get critical error \"no bootable devices found\". usb sticks work correctly on a different laptop (e.g. dell os recovery tool happy to book on asus zenbook but on the g3).it must be a bios issue, but i cannot find a way to fix it. the only half baked solution is booting to legacy with the windows media creator usb (installation fails due to safe boot not enabled) or rufus with windows iso and using mbr + disabling the options to check for tpm/safe boot (installation completes successfully, need to use the flash drive to boot every time otherwise it will not boot from the freshly installed windows in uefi). any idea what might be preventing any kind of boot when uefi is set in bios?thanks in advance.to add to the above:used f12 to choose uefi/legacy usb during boot. tried to restore the partitions of the original ssd from a macrium image to the new ssd. tried to rebuild the bcd, assign letter to the efi partition and can't remember what else, while trying to stay sane and not give in to desperation. the most frustrating thing is that the original ssd has not been touched following the upgrade, but putting it back in the laptop still results in the error rather than booting to what was there couple of days ago.uefi, secure boot, tpm (or ptt) and ahci should be enabled for windows 11. also make sure after you install windows 11 that windows boot manager is the first item in the bios boot order. and try another usb port as i have seen the installation get sketchy on one port but not another.thanks @jocean ,uefi, secure boot, ptt and ahci are enabled in the bios, but i cannot boot to any of the usb drives in that config, always get the error. all usb ports have been tried with no success. tried biosconnect today, recovery os was downloaded from the dell cloud  and after the message that the device is rebooting to recovery it came up with the same error for no bootable devices, it did not load the recovery at all.tried to remove the cmos battery (unplugged the main battery too) and time and settings were reset, but still same error.tried to flash the latest bios using the recovery image file - same.tried downgrading the bios to v 1.15 using recovery image file - same, no boot from devices in uefi, legacy works for usb.  booting to just the uefi usb drive should not be problematic, if it is configured correctly.  as long as secure boot is enabled, you should be able to see it as a uefi option.do you run optane memory in that system?the replacement drive was new and did not need to be cleaned?  i have seen situations where a problematic system drive could mess up booting the system.  you might try without the drive installed to see if you can boot the usb drive.your current configuration of the usb drive is one created using the media creation tool?can we assume you have a have a working system you can use for downloading?any chance you could get a picture of the bios and what it shows as current bootable devices.  keep in mind, a uefi drive needs to be available to the system prior to booting or restarting.thanks @saltgrass , the laptop is with the original 8 gb ddr4 samsung ram, no optane installed.the replacement drive was brand new, no need to clean it (also performed several clean commands in diskpart during my attempts).i disconnected the hdd and removed the m2 during troubleshooting and attempted booting from the usb drive only - i get the same error for no bootable devices.currently have three differently built usb sticks: windows media creation tool windows 11 (tried with windows 10 as well), rufus built usb stick with windows 11 iso from the media creation tool and dell supportassist os recovery usb - none can boot when i select a uefi option from the boot list. the windows media creation tool created usb stick can boot in legacy, dell supportassist os recovery usb requires uefi and fails in legacy.i have alternative working system which i can use for downloads and usb building.pictures to follow shortly.ok, optane memory is not system memory but a prefetch device to speed up drive operation.  it shows as optional on your system.  it is normally in an m.2 slot, if you had it.you should only have the primary drive installed when trying to do a clean install.  the old drive can confuse the install.  what is the model number of the new drive?when you look at the boot device listing, do you see the uefi version of the usb drive.  in some cases, it may be listed as both types so you have to select the correct one.it might help if you could take a picture of what you are seeing when you try to boot.boot sequencelegacy option romsafe bootptt/tpmerrorsandisk extreme usb 3.0 with windows media creation tool windows 10 22h2 - same drive used on both systems below:asus zenbook, uefi boot with safe boot enabled.dell g3 with uefi boot and safe boot enabled - entries in the boot sequence have been autodiscovered by the uefi fw and not manually created by me.boot from usb \n",

no such thermal settings there dell inspiron 7577 btw.is the thermal management support intel-based laptops only?i have an amd-based dell laptop and no thermal management option found in the dell power manager.dell-cares moderator asked me to private message laptop details..i had 2 laptops 1 is new intel-based and the other is an old one amd-based. i had an issue with amd based that is already out of warranty.  i was not expecting the answer from dell care on this dell community that \"your product is out of warranty\"  if it would be in warranty, i would have raised a complaint to their technical support directly.dell inbuilt app \"dell power manager\" should be fully functional even after the warranty expire as this is the app only.dell-cares didn't even answer if the amd laptop supports fan control or not.i found the workaround to my laptop overheating problem by installing \"hwinfo and by configuring it properly and adding task scheduler with the highest priority and bypass windows \"user account control\" to auto start the fan at full speed at power on.dell-cares are most unhelpful.  we have a new inspiron based on the ryzen 3450u apu and it has no thermal management tab either, a year on and they are clearly not fixing this issue.basically, the engineering is terrible.  the machine defaults to zero fan speed and cooks nicely until it gets to a critical temp, it then blasts the fan at 100% until the machine is cool again and then turns the fan back off until it cooks again.  we need a fan 'alway on' setting, not a full blast panic mode like dell sets it to, just a constant low fan would work fine, the apu only has a 15w tdp to deal with.thanks for the tip about hwinfo. i will have a look into it and see if third party software can solve what dell doesn't want to solve.dell power manager comes in 2 parts main app from windows store (open store and choose update) second part is the power manager service which has to be installed from support sitehttps://dl.dell.com/folder07383273m/1/dell-power-manager-service_gd7j6_win64_3.9.0_a00.exe i have an amd chip on my g5 5505, so this is not helpful. the dell website say \" intel dynamic platform and thermal framework driver (chipset)\" is not compatible with my system.how do i enable the \"power management\" settings? or alternatively, how to i set my fan controller to \"cool\" mode so my fans spin up before my computer crashes.note i don't want an ultra performance mode or something that increases my cpu speed and heat. i just want to increase the fan speed, nothing else. so don't tell me to turn on gaming mode or something because that's just dumb.\n",

      "content: the latest dell oem graphics driver for the inspiron 15 5510 is 27.20.100.9749 (intel iris xe), and there are problems in the following games, so far (will test others):ark: survival evolved - turning on/increasing game sharpening slider in the intel graphics command center causes severe graphical issues in-game, to the point which makes it unplayable. turning off game sharpening fixes the issue for now.halo: the master chief collection - grass in halo: reach looks dotted when you move away from it. the ambient occlusion in halo: combat evolved anniversary also suffers from dotted-ness, turning of anti-aliasing in halo: combat evolved anniversary reduces the dotted ambient occlusion. halo: combat evolved anniversary is unplayable in classic graphics mode (very low fps), but remastered graphics work fine, with some stuttering.also, pressing the windows key or alt-tabbing out of game, then going beck in-game crashes the graphics driver.intel's latest generic graphics driver 30.0.101.1191 fixed many issues with many games, including halo and ark, but i haven't installed them because everyone knows that you shouldn't install generic drivers on oem laptops. but dell's drivers are unfortunately quite outdated.i also have 3 questions for dell:1) are you planning to update the graphics drivers for your laptops soon, because i bought it for gaming, and i've read that some oem's update their drivers rarely?2) i read that intel unlocked it's generic drivers so that oem users can install them without losing oem customizations. so if i install the latest generic intel graphics drivers, do i have to be worried about anything, can i revert back to dell's oem drivers and my laptop and games will work, or will it screw up my system in some way and i'll have to reinstall windows to properly reset my graphics drivers back to oem ones?3) there are updates for the intel graphics command center, intel optane memory and storage management, all of dell's apps (my dell, dell mobile connect, dell digital delivery etc) and other apps in the microsoft store. i checked dell's website and they have no new drivers or updates. so should i update them through microsoft store or will it overwrite the oem drivers or cause errors/issues?i forgot to mention this game: doom (2016) freezes when i try to reduce the in-game resolution scale graphics option to a number below 100%.actually you can do that and i am also the onwer of inspiron 5510. the newer dch based drivers if downloaded from intel only updates the generic intel based implementation in the original driver and leaves the dell based implementation untouched.alright, thank you so much!new graphics driver released by dell. check it out.i updated it as soon as it was released and, ark is playable with game sharpening on, but, the entire screen turns red (including the main menu), so the problem has gotten worse, and the graphics driver crash when alt-tabbing out of a game and then going back in is still there, so basically, the new driver fixed nothing :(.dell, please update your intel graphics driver for the inspiron 15 5510, the latest driver released by intel is 30.0.101.1660, while dell's driver is 30.0.100.9955. i bought the inspiron 15 5510 mostly for gaming, i understand that you have to release drivers for a bunch of systems and models, like inspiron, xps, vostro, latitude etc, and that takes a lot of time and effort, but please, take my request for updating graphics drivers more frequently under consideration, since the iris xe is surprisingly good for gaming and the newer drivers are fixing many issues with a lot of games. thank you!hello, i see you are looking for technical assistance. if you need our help, you can start a private message with us and we will be happy to assist you.#iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".dell, the latest iris xe graphics driver for the inspiron 15 5510 is 30.0.101.1692, which was released in july 7, 2022. intel's latest graphics driver is 31.0.101.3430, which was released in september 27, 2022, has fixed issues in the following games:1. monste.r hunter rise          - it required shader compilation at every game launch on 11th and 12th generation intel core processors, (fixed in the latest intel drivers)2. call of duty: vanguard          - an error message pop-up when launching, (fixed in the latest intel drivers)3. gears 5          - a black screen or tdr used to occur after launching, or during gameplay, (fixed in the latest intel drivers)4. assassin’s creed valhalla          - application crashes or error messages during gameplay, (fixed in the latest intel drivers)5. dolmen          - application crashes shortly after launch, (fixed in the latest intel drivers)6. red dead redemption 2 (vulkan)           - application crash when performing an alt+tab to desktop, (fixed in the latest intel drivers)could you, please, update the intel iris xe graphics drivers for the inspiron 15 5510 to the latest version (31.0.101.3430), much thanks in advance! i have to thank you for one thing though, whenever i have requested/asked for driver updates for the intel iris xe, you have, indeed, updated them to the latest version i requested, i really thank you and appreciate that!!! and again, i bought the inspiron 15 5510 mainly for gaming, because the iris xe is amazing, and that is why i keep asking/requesting for driver updates for the iris xe, i hope you understand. again, thank you!!!intel's latest driver for iris xe is 31.0.101.3729 as of october 20, 2022, not 31.0.101.3430.\n",

      "content:  i had a lot of problems when i first received this computer with the touchpad acting erratic. it was mostly fixed when they finally replaced the touchpad. in the late april timeframe. it still did it when i startup or wakeup my computer. takes 5 minutes or so until it settles down. i believe this behavior is because the system is busy taking all the resources for other startup operation. you really wouldn't think this should be an issue with a 11th gen i-7 processor with 16gb of ram. the issue still happened here or there and was annoying.fast forward to now in the winter when it's super dry in my home. the erratic touchpad issue is back a lot more. however, if i pull out the power plug just enough that i can get my fingernail on the shell but still keep it powering the laptop, then the issue resolves itself, sometimes instantly and others some matter of seconds. it comes and goes repeatedly so i repeat the grounding scheme.back when i had the original issue, i read on a forum of some grounding pad issue inside. i looked when it was serviced, and it seemed like it had the adequate grounding. now i wonder if it needs more grounding. or maybe a palmrest that is connected to ground; scrap the paint off of it??? i have about 49 days on my service contract which would easily pass based on how long it took to resolve the previous issue.thoughts? oh yeah, i forgot to mention that i messed with the win10 touchpad sensitivity and didn't notice much difference. i left it on low sensitivity.\n",

      "content: i unfortunately have an issue with one of the hinges, shortly after expiration of the warranty (always like that, isn’t it?!). first, it only seemed to be a straight crack (right where the seem is). after three days i now am not able to close my laptop anymore. if i try to do so, the back of the screen separates from the front part and it makes a very unpleasant sound.so i contacted dell customer service and sent pictures. their response is, i need to pay $40 so ship it in and they will contact me in 1-2 weeks or so to let me know how much i would have to pay for. i will get a box shipped to my house to send my laptop in. now with my problem, not being able to close the laptop, dell doesn’t have a box big enough. after 30 minutes on hold, her talking to the team, (what i did appreciate!) i was told that the lcd needs to be replaced for around $140 and since i can’t ship it to them, i need to get a technician to my house for more than $160. and if they would find something else wrong, i (obviously) need to pay for that too.i am very upset how that was handled, especially since hinges are a common issue with laptops, especially inspiron series, so have i found online. i went on a hunt how and where i can get it fixed for less money and also faster. i make part of my living via that computer, i cannot afford to not use it for even a week. i found a local computer repair shop this afternoon (friday) and he will fix the hinges for $65 and i can pick it up monday!!! the lcd has nothing to do with my laptop not closing. good job dell, very disappointing move. it is my first, but definitely will be my last dell product ever! and i for sure will not recommend it to anyone. if you have the same problem, please contact a local computer repair shop, they appreciate the money more, you pay less and get it done faster. \n",

      "content: i recently received a dell g15 5525, i installed windows 10 through the microsoft website and proceeded to update the drivers. i restarted and everything seems fine. i updated the nvidia graphics card when it was promoted through nvidia geforce experience software. i restarted after the update and the laptop monitor wouldn't register anything. the only way to know what's going on with the pc is by connecting another monitor with hdmi after the laptop has started up.i can't see the bios on either monitor, i assume because windows is the only thing that is letting me see anything on the external montior. i have reverted the graphics diver but still, the issue persists. i tried reverting everything back and even resetting the windows but to no avail. i used my warranty to get a replacement unit and the same exact issue happened. with the first unit, the company said that it was a memory problem. but how likely is it to have both new devices happen again? i haven't yet contacted my warranty. what could be causing this and how to fix it?did you manage to solve? i have the same problem since the beginning of december and i still haven't been able to use both drivers simultaneously. i can only use the integrated monitor if i disable advanced optimus in the biosno mate, unfortunately not. i even took it to an expert computer shop and they couldn't figure it out\n",

see my post here: https://www.dell.com/community/latitude/latitude-7420-w-lg-27ul850-monitor-wd19s-dock-4k-only-30hz-b...thanks dcs, i previously gave up looking into this issue, but checking again now, it appears to be running at 60hz.i am not sure if the quality is worse. it looks pretty clear for my setup, but i have only done a quick test. i will have to do a more thorough comparison.strangely the monitor osd display info just says \"2160p\" (doesn't show the hz) when plugged into the dock, but explicitly says \"3840x2160, 60hz\" if i plug it into the laptop hdmi.the win11 advanced display properties say \"ycbcr420\" color space at 60hz when using the dock, but \"rgb\" color space at 60hz when plugged into the laptop. maybe the ycbcr420 color space is causing the image quality issues for your setup?i will have to get a dp cable so i can try and run both my external monitors through the dock. as you indicated, plugging monitors directly into the laptop does kind of defeat the purpose of the dock.thanks for taking the time to reply to my issue with your solution!good point on the color format. i confirmed the wd19s hdmi port is ycbcr420, while the 7420's hdmi port is rgb (both 8 bit). seems to indeed be the issue, but i can't find a way to fix it. in the \"intel graphics command center\", i get a lot of choices for color format and bits when plugged into the laptop's hdmi port. if i switch that to ycbcr420, the built in hdmi port looks as bad as the dock (blurry/odd colors as described in above post). switching back to rgb fixes it. the rub is when i plug into the wd19s, those settings choices go away (no longer can change color format, etc.). so i don't see a way to move the hub output to rgb which would likely fix my problem and allow me to only plug in one wire (hub usb-c), vs. two (+hdmi).  any ideas?from the intel graphics command center, i see this interesting bit of info...when directly connected to the laptop it shows as \"hdmi\", in the information tab, and allows color format changes in the general tab: yet when plugged into the hdmi port in the wd19s, the app things it's a displayport!  and any color format settings options go away.  seems the dock is doing some internal translation/shenanigans which the pc/intel drivers mis-interpret.  given this i may be sol    okay, i think i've got mine working now. anyone trying to use a cheap 4k tv as a computer monitor from a wd19s hub via hdmi on an hbr3 system may benefit from this (make sure you set to game / pc mode on your tv to get the best monitor setup and lowest latency without any of the tv's image smoothing algorithms turned on).i noticed in the hub specs that hbr3 systems max out at a single external 4k@60hz, but can go to 8k@60hz (or dual 4k@60hz) if using display stream compression (which i think only applies to dp, not hdmi).  since this wd19s shows it's hdmi port as dp to windows, i thought this may free up some bandwidth to allow rbg color format and fix my blurrines.oddly, many dell systems don't enable dsc by default, but i found an article on how to enable it on my 7420:https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000197102/how-to-enable-display-stream-compression-on-latit... doing so and re-booting now defaulted the wd19s's hdmi port to rgb color format when running at 4k@60hz.i still can't \"change\" the color format, but the extra bandwidth popped this over to rgb and now i'm crystal clear identical looking to the laptop's hdmi port.i've found trying to enable hdr is a waste of time and make the daily \"office pc\" view actually worse.  best setup for my eyes is 4k@60hz - rgb -  8-bit - sdr. sad that a user has to do all this digging instead of it just working as expected out of the box...thanks again dcs,enabling dsc as above has worked for me too, but after playing around with the intel command center a bit.after first enabling dsc and restarting my pc, it was outputting 10-bit rgb 30hz through hdmi, and ycbcr420 30hz through the dock (i think it also showed 10-bit, but can't confirm now). as with you, i can't change the output colour format or bit depth when plugged into the dock, so it seemed enabling dsc was worse for my case, forcing it back to 30hz through the dock.i plugged it back into hdmi, set it to 8-bit through the intel command center and plugged it into the dock again. now it is defaulting to 8-bit rgb 60hz through the dock too.happy days. i still have to get a dp cable to i can finally attempt plugging both my monitors into the dock at once (one 4k, the other 1080p)\n",

      "content: hi every one, i have dell g5 15 5590 laptop (it contains 512 gb nvme hdd) and the original battery that is shipped with it is 6 cells, i replaced it by another one 4 cells to add 2nd hdd to increase storage, i don't find the original 2nd hdd connector flat (12 pins) in its shipping box but the socket of 2nd hdd is exist in its position in the laptop. i connect the healthy hdd with the original connector, it isn't detected and not shown in disk management after restart the laptop, does that means the configuration of the 2nd hard-disk drive is available only on the laptops that are shipped with 4-cell battery or there is any reason? your post confused me, so did you have the correct cable and plug (interposer) for the hdd (it does not come in the box)? the correct interposer would have been in the system already but since it did not come with an hdd you may have to order it from dell or from a 3rd source such as this page at youtube.many thanks mr. ocean for help me to solve my problem, i try to connect used original cable 12 pins but also not detected after restart. i ask for if these g5 laptops models that originally shipped by 6 cell battery not configured to add 2nd hhd or it's possible to replace the 6-cell battery by one of 4-cell and add 2nd hdd (as my case) and the reason of problem in the faulty cable.best regards,please try the steps below:1. make sure all drivers are updated https://www.dell.com/support/2. perform a hard reset on the laptop and use a known good outletdisconnect any external devices including the ac adapterhold the power button down for 10 seconds (20 seconds for alienware)bypass any power strips, surge protectors or battery backupsverify the wall outlet is functionalproceed to the next stepplug only the ac adapter back into the laptopattempt to power on the systemrestart the computer to ensure the issue is resolved.3. battery resetremove the panel and gently detach the battery cable (strip) and press the power button for 20-30 seconds.make sure while performing this steps all the external peripherals should be disconnected.then reconnect the battery cable restart the system and check.\n",

      "content: i have new inspiron 16 plus for a month and  it has touchpad problem  randomly. touchpad has random taps and swipes, inaccurate finger tracking. i will contact with dell but wondering is there anyone has that problem or any simple solution for it.sgaddala, this touchpad problem is a very widespread problem that has plagued users of the inspiron 16 7610 since its launch. it's caused by static buildup on the touchpad, and inadequate grounding. it affects at least a third of insp 7610  owners at this point.there is one diy fix for it, it involves taking the back cover off and grounding the touchpad with the touchpad frame. i'll link you to the thread here that covers this fix, and a simpler aluminum tape non-soldering fix. i actually fixed mine this way, and it's been working perfectly for 3 months now. please be warned this will void your warranty. that's why i need to first recommend contacting dell below...i would recommend you first go through dell tech support. dell is recently aware of the problem, and they *may* have a redesigned touchpad that they can repair yours with, but i will warn you, that's what they told me back in march of this year, and they replaced the touchpad with the same faulty design and it glitched out on me again within a week. hopefully, they have a working fix for this, and you can get it resolved.here's how you approach dell:1-  try to recreate the problem. it's intermittent, so it will happen whenever it decides to. usually after about 30 minutes of using your device. if it happens, use your phone to video the problem. don't just video your screen, record your hand and the screen while you're moving the touchpad.2- try to recreate the problem in bios setup. if you're in the middle of your touchpad glitching out, reboot, and start spamming f2 until you end up in the bios setup screen. no need to change any settings. the touchpad will probably behave itself for a few minutes, and then start glitching out. this footage is valuable because it shows dell it's not a windows driver related problem.3- open your ticket and tell them you have video footage of the problem. they will escalate your issue, and send someone else out to replace the touchpad.in the mean time, so that you don't drive yourself crazy, here are some short-term fixes the rest of us picked up:good luck! and i'm sorry you have to deal with this. this problem drove me crazy for months until somebody figured out the diy fix. i went through a full laptop replacement, and a visit from a dell technician. dell even offered me a full refund 8 months after i bought it. the problem came back 45 days after they replaced the whole laptop, and a week after my touchpad was replaced. now i just want to spare others the grief i had to go through. good luck! looking for the same issue. bumped into your thread. thanks for creating it. looking forward for solution. <non-public info removed.tos73>the most common placement is on the f9 key. to re-enable the touchpad on your dell computer, press the button resembling a touchpad button and see whether you regain the touchpad functionality.the f9 key on the 7610 has nothing to do with touchpad or touchpad settings.the issue as stated below is a design fault. the problem could be remedied by providing a more adequate ground to the touchpad. no one has yet to confirm the latest touchpad design from touchpad replacements provide a permanent fix. i am also getting the same problem. everything works fine other than touch pad and scroll .. very difficult to use the laptop. my brand new inspiron 16 5620 is also giving the same erratic trackpad problem. not sure what to do. dell support has tried a number of software solutions but all have been a temporary fix.\n",

guess i need to buy a new laptop.   hp, lenovo anybody have a recommendation?  more information here which would seem to confirm the problem. the hinges can be ordered and installed by yourself or a local pc shop, or sent to dell as the link describes. and more information here as well. and the parts are here.   i am also facing the same issue and this has happened to my laptop twice without any jerk or physical damage by me.both the times the left hinge broke out. i think this is a design issue with the model. the repair cost is too high and now i am not sure what to do.no help from dell what-so-ever. they are simply denying this being a design issue even after so many complaints. @jocean @4speedbluefwiw, i have a 5577.  it still looks and works like new.  i use my 5577 in my recording studio, not for gaming. dell forum member since 2002dell inspiron 15  gaming 5577 laptophome built desktop pc with gigabyte designare z390,  i9 9900k cpuwindows 11 64 bit pro, 22h2, ssd drives. cakewalk by bandlab and studio one 4.6 pro recording studio software, motu ultralite mk5 recording interface unit.dell s2719dgf monitoryou can get this knot straightened out by dell service team for some amount of money.the loosened hinge can be tightened and you could use your laptop as good as new.you do not need to buy a new laptop.you are right. poor engineering and paper thin bottom case. i have been in it for over 30 years and own my own consulting company. i contacted dell when i found that the bottom case holds the 2 pairs of screws that support the hinges ripped right out. i informed them that this is a design flaw that the hinges are two stiff for the flimsy case to support the screws. dell offered to repair it for around $250 which i refused because it's their design issue. some people have complained (so i've read here in these forums) that the screws weren't completely tightened (poor quality control). eventually the posts that support the screws in the case snap. my left hinge broke and after a short time, the right side posts snap as well. since dell refuses to take responsibility, i notified them that my 20 years of purchase of dell products as stopped.i bought a new bottom case for about $30 and repaired it myself with the help of a youtube video. just take your time and it isn't hard. and tell dell to shove it.i am having same issue, the left hinge is totally snapped out. when i opened the back lid, the screw holding it just came of without even unscrewing. i wonder i have to replace the whole back panel. really bad quality of build. the dell support didn't help at all. same deal here. bought tons of dell desktops and laptops for self and family members since 1993. had the same left hinge issue. rendered the 5577 so damaged that i had to replace the top case and will now be replacing the bottom case because the locking mechanisms have popped out and the plastic holes are beyond repair and new screen wiring because the screen is in perpetual flicker. when i first approached dell when this started, they might as well have abbreviated their response <substitute character removed> because they could not care less once they get their money for the product or you pay through the nose for a warranty program that, guess what?, they wouldn’t recognize calling the problem “wear and tear”. i’m on my third year of the 5577 and i’ve pretty much spent what i paid for it i’m repairs and parts replacements (ac adapters, defective wifi adapter wire (the clip warps and breaks), two batteries, a fan, etc.) dell has simply become a horrible company with fifth-grade quality control and total disdain for customers. i’m just waiting fir the next inevitable part break at which point i’m replacing the whole thing with what, trust me, i’d not going to be a dell. i'm having this same issue. the hinge came away from the case, through the screen, smashing it. as a long time loyal dell user of laptops and desktops, for them not to own this gross manufacturing failure is very poor customer service and more than enough for me to move away from them. unfortunately i just bought another one to replace this laptop before i realized what the cause was. has anyone got any helpful reply from dell, where they owned the poor material selection, design and/or workmanship that caused so many failures? i would be more than happy to replace the case and screen myself but at a part cost of almost $450, if it was even in stock, which it is not, feels like way too big a risk knowing the same issue could happen again. what part in the system did they quote at $450?  the only part in a notebook that costs anywhere near that much is a mainboard.or was that damaged as a result of the hinge failure? \n",

      "content: i bought my inspiron 16 7610 five months ago. the hardware and software had been working as expected for a new laptop, until the cold night i opened the lid and heard a crack. then i realized the right hinge had broken. somehow the mechanism did not open and the top side of the metallic hinge attached to the lower right corner of the screen had come out of its plastic cover. it is worth mentioning, my laptop was never hit or dropped and has no scratches because i have always used my laptop with extreme care. at the time i reached the dell technical support to check the factory guarantee, i was sure they would agree to replace the broken hinge (there is no way they can blame me for a factory assembly problem). but to my surprise, this kind of failure is not covered by the basic guarantee agreement.i’m very disappointed of realize that all dell customers should pay for the repair if their brand new computer if the pieces fall apart. be careful is not enough, it seems you will have to pay for the ‘accidental damage’ if you want to be covered against ‘bad design’, or ‘bad assembly’ problems. which is cheaper than $179 i paid for the repair. i hope this helps others save money!photo i sent to technical support photo i sent to technical support same issuei had same issue.hinge broken when i close the lid.dell cc told this kind of damage will not cover under warranty..i have been using laptop very carefully..this could be the result of bad design.  i had exactly the same issue. after the hinge broke - it damaged the lcd. originally i thought the lcd damage was due to some other issue. but i after i opened it - i realized that it's the hinge broke off and pried the lcd panel from the back. not only i had to replace the lcd for $120, but i could not completely solve the hinge problem: lcd back cover costs a fortune, you can't find replacement hinges anywhere, and none of that is covered by dell warranty. extremely frustrated.where did you get it fixed for $179 i have the same issue and the micro center said it was due to me dropping it (i didn’t) and they are trying to charge me $600i contacted dell technical support this is such a rip-off... the new lcd costs $120. it took me half a day to replace it, however. most of that time was an attempt to make it look pretty, or trying to make it look like it originally looked like.. i guess they are charging $100 per hour for the repair job??.... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  ... still ended up not having the hinge covers. but the laptop works great after the laptop replacement. i had to use superglue to glue the broken hinge. the plastic parts that are supposed to hold the hinge all broke-off... lcd i bought to replace the original lcd was\"16 inch for dell inspiron 16 plus 7610 7610-mhj8f led lcd screen p/n: xc0mj qhd 3072*1920 3k auo9f91 ips laptop display panel\" from aliexpress for $98+shipping+tx, turned out $120..<non-public info removed. tos73> since it seems like common issue. the plastic holders are total trash, they just kinda melt, i think from the hot air that comes from the gpu.i have had the same problem. over £1000 laptop and they build them to last 6month! terrible. i won't be buying a dell ever again. now got to find someone to fix it! yeah i just had the same issue. i've been fairly careful with my laptop as well but one fine morning i opened the laptop to see a loose hinge which ended up prying open the laptop screen and the display unit screws. the screen still technically works. it's out of warranty and i'm still waiting for a quote but according to them they have to replace the whole display unit which according to them might cost 400eur! i was living with the terrible trackpad that they have on this machine and now this hinge! dell surely has terrible qa.\n",

      "content: hi everyone,i am a sad owner of the dell inspiron 15 3567. my laptop has been randomly shutting down (usually on battery power but sometimes on ac aswell) for well over 2 years. the only error code i could find was 'asf2 force shutdown' in the bios.as a pc hobbist i would love if someone from dell can explain in detail, possible reasons for this error and what it actually means (i have scoured the internet already)anyhow, my problem started with the keyboard randomly typing a string of symbols and the letter 'k' one day while working, a few minutes after which my laptop powered off without warning.  it got progressively worse from then on, more frequent random typing and quicker shutdowns. until the point where i could no longer use my laptop at all. during this time the random shut downs happened on both ac and battery power. so i took a break from this laptop an it sat with the battery out for about 3 months.3 months later:the laptop now also struggles to charge the battery (while off or on) to anything over 50%, at which point it starts flashing 4 amber lights and 1 white light before powering down completely and not turning on again unless the battery is removed and reinserted.it also seems that if the laptop is not used for a long time (a month or so) then reconnected using battery it lasts longer without randomly shutting down.resetting cmos also seems to have the same effect.btw this is not a windows issue as this also happens in the bios and even when the laptop is running without any additional components inside.i've seen a post on the inspiron 7000 forum: https://www.dell.com/community/inspiron/asf2-force-shut-down-on-my-15-7567/td-p/6048034where a bios update fixed the issue after 1+ year, just want to know if this is a known solution to this worth the risk of updating the bios because if the laptop decides to shutdown during bios flashing that would leave it completely useless and bricked (at least i can currently use it as a workstation on ac).i have tried resetting the bios, changing out ram, running the laptop without the keyboard but it keeps shuting down the same way.regards!\n",

      "content: hello,i have  a problem with crackling front speaker when music is played. in headphones, such a problem was not observed - basically it looks like speaker problem. that crackling sounds starts around 40% of volume  and can be heard for quiter parts of music (tested on 00:00 - 01:00 hans zimmer - time). initially, i thought this a problem of that particular laptop - but this is a second one i tested. previously, i had a problem with left speaker - now with right one. have you experienced such problems ? your laptop would have have a realtek audio driver pre-installed. assuming that driver is still installed, switch to the windows native audio driver to test the speakers.1. open the device manager (type devmgmt.msc in the windows search box).2. expand the \"sound, video & game controllers\" and right click on \"realtek high definition audio\".3. select to \"update driver software\".4. click on \"browse my computer for driver software\".5. click \"let me pick from a list of drivers on my computer\".6. put a check in the box \"show compatible hardware\" if not already checked.7. in the list of devices, click \"high definition audio\" (the native driver).8. click \"next\".9. on the update driver warning box, click \"yes\" (install the driver).10. restart the laptop if prompted. if not prompted, then no need to restart.[to get back to the realtek driver, do it again but reverse the names in steps 1 and 6.]if the speakers crackle even with the native driver then it could well be hardware failure. contact tech support to have it repaired.\n",

      "content: hii recently bought a d6000 (used) to use it with my macbook pro 13. before using it i wanted to check / upgrade bios. however none of my windows 10/11 laptops (dell, msi, huawei) want to detect the docking station? both on usb type-a and usb type-c.the dock itself seems to work after installing the displaylink drivers. i've display on two external monitors. but it does not work to charge the macbook pro 13. therefore, i would like to try the firmware upgrade due to this post:macos catalina and d6000 - no chargingthe usb hub seems to work selectively. the pendrive works, the usb mouse does not.none of the updater versions: a04, a02, a00 detect the dock?what i can do?hi,i have the same problem with my updater not detecting the dock in a windows env. i tried updating the firmware v 04 and it wouldn't detect. howeveri was able to upgrade the v01 and v02 (see screenshot > 'older versions'), using the usb a connector/adapter. but since i can't find a v03 i am stuck. the d6000 a04 updater does not want to recognize the dock. it seems at some point in time the a03 version existed, but i cannot for the life of me find a safe way to download it. (*tested on an intel thinkpad t14)   i was able to find the page for the missing driver, but i am unable to locate the file. this is a direct link i found to and old dell page, so the v03 did exist. when trying to contact support they keep sending me from left to right with no actual help.. tried facebook contacting:  they send you to the 'out of warranty' team with no decent communicationhowever this team needs a service tag that the d6000 dock does not have.. see below linkhttps://www.dell.com/support/contents/nl-be/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/locat...hi, thank you for hint. but in my case i've tried all available versions before - a01, a02 and a04 which are available on dell website. not discovered by any updater.i've purchased second d6000 dock, from another person - this time dock was detected from the beginning. firmware was also difference between those 2 docs is manufactured date: 2018 vs 2021.ps. on second dock i've another problem, sometimes one monitor is bouncing. after few power restarts / usb re-plug it's stabilized. but is probably due to display link firmware / software. don't know where problem is, but is visible on mac / win. i too am having this issue with my d6000 dock.  i've tried it usb a, usb c, and one multiple windows machines.  a02 and a03 updaters recognize the dock, i had already updated to a02 before attempting to update to a04, so the solution one person on reddit posted (go to a02 then a04) didn't work for me.internet archive will give you t8y8t (a03) though i'm still uncertain why dell pulled it from their website.http://web.archive.org/web/20201111194247/downloads.dell.com/folder05691661m/1/dock_d6000_fw_updater...now i'm on a03, but a04 still refuses to recognize the dock.  i spent some time digging into the temp files the updater extracts while running and it seems to use usbtreeview to query the usb devices, but i can't for the life of me determine what's different between what a02/a03 (which do find it) and a04 are looking for.same problem.dock is able to update to a01, a02 (and is recognized using both updaters) but is not recognized via a04 updater. this behaviour is the same on 4 different devices (thinkpad t480s/t490, hp elitedesk 705, lattitude 7480) using usb-a and usb-cfeel like there's something dell didn't bother to document in this update regarding compatibility with older d6000 chipsets (would be nice if there was any documentation on chipset used?)same issue.in device manager the dell 5480 laptop shows that it is connected to a d6000 dock.when i go to run the firmware update i get that message to connect the dock to the laptop.this was an attempt to fix the front usb ports on the d6000. they recently stopped working. the back ones work fine. also, the laptop doesn't recognize the dock when using usbc, only when the usbc is plugged in using the usb adapter that is attached to the cord.i am running all of the driver updates available with dell command to see if that brings it back.i purchased 2 d6000 used.one unit successfully worked / firmware updated to latestthe other one suffers the same issue as yours.  since one of the two units worked, i can eliminate the pc setup as the issue.  the issue must be with the defective d6000.from what i can tell, usb ports do not work with the defective unit.  hdmi / displayports / audio / ethernet works.  i need to manually unplug the power from time to time.  cold boot / sleep sometimes loses displays.\n",

      "content: i have checked elsewhere and tried many different ways to solve this problem without success.my laptop's screen when not connected to the power adapter changes brightness depending on what's on screen. i've changed all kinds of settings which seem to have worked for when the power adapter is plugged in but as soon as i pull the adapter out the screen goes back to changing again.  it's driving me crazy as i use this laptop for image/photo editing and i get headaches from this continuing flickering brightness change.open settings > system >.battery and turn off \"lower screen brightness while in battery power\" move the slider, click battery on bottom right side and move it towards performance  thanks xps_man,unfortunately, was one of the things i've already done so is unchecked but changes are still happening. very much appreciate your reply though.last thing to check  hi xps_man,i followed your advicei also have adaptive brightness switched to offeven though display power savings is switched off i also previously adjusted power efficency to 1and also previously set enhanced power saving to off just in case.thanks for you help though here is a link to a video on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mil-ibyhlig - showing just how strongly the brightness changes (my phone's camera's brightness settings have autobrightness switched off, as you can see when you look away from the laptop in the video .. the brightness of the room doesn't change and remains constant.just finished a remote session with a dell technician... unfortunately this appears to be happening to a few dell laptop users and is something that has been imposed by windows without any way of switching it off.  i will continue trying to look for answers just in case something crops up, and if anyone has any more ideas please let me know.links i've tried but without success but putting here just in case they might help other people -1) fix: windows 10 adaptive brightness won’t turn off https://appuals.com/fix-windows-10-adaptive-brightness-wont-turn-off/2) how to enable or disable adaptive brightness in windows 10https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/70157-enable-disable-adaptive-brightness-windows-10-a.html3) add or remove 'enable adaptive brightness' from power options in windowshttps://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/85503-remove-enable-adaptive-brightness-power-options-windows.ht...what you are experiencing is the effect of \"intel display power saving\". this is not related to adaptive brightness and is a feature of the intel chip inside your laptop. to toggle it off, do the following:1. download intel graphics command centre from the microsoft store app on your laptop2. open it, then go to system3. after that, go to power4. there would be 2 sections - \"on battery\" and \"plugged in\". both would have a \"display power savings\" option. toggle it off for both.  after this, you should stop experiencing this dimming of display.adrian, unfortunately as you will see from the previous conversation above i have already tried variations of this solution with no change. just yesterday a dell technician remotely connected to my laptop to try to resolve the issue, they too checked the elements you and others have described above and the problem still remains. there is a known bug described by the dell technician that on some laptops the problem is to do with windows itself. they have left the problem as being unsolved and when a solution arises they will let me know.just checking with your specific response adrian none of the options you describe are available in my laptop's version of intel graphics command centre. here's a screen capture so you can see -\n",

      "content: so as the title says, the inspiron 7559 i am working on for my roommate is giving me the 2/7 pattern. it's a nice machine for his purposes. we got it working a few months ago with a cmos drain, but it only worked for a short while. it sat for a bit and i have done a bunch of looking around, so i know that it means there is something wrong with the lcd screen, or maybe the cable, since the self-check test passes when i do that whole thing... all i want to know is if it is worth it try the cable replacement, or do you think that it is an issue with the mainboard and i need to maybe replace something else? i run a small computer repair shop from my house and have a lot of experience with complicated fixes, so i am prepared for things to get complicated haha but i figured i would at least ask here whether or not it's even worth it.also, if it's the board, are things replaceable on this motherboard, or do i basically have to replace the whole thing?solved!go to solution.i have dell inspiron 7 series laptop. i had to disconnect the laptop lcd to fix the broken holds for hinges. now that's another story.coming back to lcd screen issue, i connected an external monitor using to laptop's hdmi port. and the laptop is working fine. the power light keeps blinking the code 2 amber 7 white, but, the laptop operation is not affected by that.initially, i had to go through bios setup because i had disconnected bios battery, but once that was done, the laptop works fine. i have used the laptop part for sending and receiving mails, downloads and some other uses. did not face any issues.so, the blink code, as i think, is neither dreaded nor unworkable. it's just that one needs to get used to work with new setup. this message is being typed using the same laptop....err...now a partial desktop.view solution in original post2 amber, 7 white led blinking indicates an lcd failurethe led code devises a unique blinking pattern in two groups to indicate the error on the system.the first group (amber color) of led blinks (1 through 9) followed by a brief pause, and then a second group (white color) of led blinks (1 through 9) with a longer pause before repeating over again.for other inspiron laptop systems, you can refer to this link for the led codes.need further assistance?

answer: yes, absolutely, this issue has no fix.fair point, but it doesn't change mine either. all i was looking for was some confirmation on a simple question: is it doomed to a motherboard replacement? answer: yes, absolutely, this issue has no fix.if the epsa/psa error indicates that it is a motherboard failure then, yes, you are doomed to a motherboard replacement.we are a repair shop having the same problem today during a a screen replacement job for a inspiron 15\" 7559. device came in not powering on, i thought it was battery flat so i just proceeded without testing to put the new screen on. after putting the new one on it i found it was still not powering on, it stuck at a black screen and led blinking 2 amber then 7 white as described in the heading.  therefore i put back the old screen but it was the same black screen. after some play around and switching the old & new screens, pull and putting the connector back and secure it with tape etc etc. in one of the million times i made it to boot into windows normally, everything went fine so i put everything back with the screen on and shut down the machine. i tried to run a last test before calling the customer in, found it came back stuck at black screen again. i touched nothing at all and the machine shut down like normal, no flickering no nothing. i followed instruction found on some other threads here to long press d then power on, it ran on a self test. so i did with the old screen on, nothing happens. then with new screen on, i could see the screen have slight color changes this time but without any back light at all. putting the old screen back on again, this time backlight lit up but screen was badly cracked so i couldn't see anything, and after just a hard power off, it came back to the black screen again. sooooooo frustrated!after looking up the fault code, the led blink shall point to lcd problem. however the tests result switching between the old & new screens was kinda on & off, there was no solid conclusion of whats wrong also i couldn't make another successful boot into windows. in one of the long press d self tests the new screen has lit up and it could run thru the entire self test with different solid color screens but it just wont boot into windows, and i could not make another self test run with backlight on.i started playing around with the lcd cable, cleaned the socket and connector with alcohol and tried again, same black screen. then i have gently twisted the cable and putting the old screen on. it booted again! so this time i have hooked up an external monitor and did the bios update immediately. after the bios update i put on the new screen very carefully and now it boots every time now. customer has picked up the machine and both of us are happy now ;)conclusion:i really dont know if it was the cable or bios update did the magic for me but i will suggest to first update the bios first if you are experiencing this during a lcd repair. if nothing has been replaced and it happen suddenly. the lcd cable will lead to this therefore try pulling the bezel around the lcd, unscrew the 4 screws and take the lcd out. carefully lift the tape and use the little \"handle\" to gently slide the connector out of the socket in opposite direction of the tape, then putting it back carefully. do not touch the connector, do not bent or pull the cable by force, it is not that fragile but it only take 1 hit to kill it if you do it improperly.  good luck!  here is my fix  2 amber 7 white code dell windows 10hxxps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnx6bjtg5vo&feature=youtu.besame issue. did you find any solution?so i read your solution and bended the lcd before booting and then i saw that pc was booting properly in 1-3 trials which was way long as you said one in millions of trials. i then removed bezel and screws then remove the connector and lcd, then twisted one turn that white cable that connects to lcd. reconnected the lcd and placed eveything on their places. restarted and boom. it works pretty fine and starts everytime. this is the fix i guess for some cases.looks like you just saved my dell 7000 laptop. thank you so much. the first thing that happened was the blinking lights 2 amber 7 white but everything still worked. i plugged it in and powered off and the next time the screen was gone but i could still see it logging me in. i made sure and turned it off then long press d and power on had remarkable full screen color changes while i guess it ran diagnostics and it i got it back. thanks again! j\n",

      "content:   my uncle bought back in 2011 a dell inspiron n7110 made in may of 2010. he gave it to me today because he didn’t need it. the laptop came with windows 7 pre installed but he had upgraded all the way to windows 10. the first thing i did, after i got the laptop and backed up his data in case he needs them in the feature, was to install fedora 37 (my os of choice). trying to boot the usb resulted in an error message saying “operation system not found”. after trying changing some bios settings, i decided to try the same but this time burning the iso with rufus using iso mode. it booted and installed just fine. rebooting the computer resulted in the same error message, this time booting from the internal hard drive. i have tried 8 different linux distros and windows 10 but everything resulted in the same issue. i also tried updating the bios from a08 to a13 using freedos. what i find interesting is that the computer won’t boot and give this error message every time unless i’ve created the usb using rufus. any ideas? i’ve already changed a ton of bios settings, used different usb flash drives, used different ports. thank you in advance!solved!go to solution.so i found the issue. most modern operating system like windows and linux, when on legacy computers, they use the gpt partition table with a compatibility layer called bios boot that emulates the master boot record partition table. this works perfectly fine on most computers except this. the solution was to force linux to install using the mbr partition table and for grub to only install legacy support and not efi. that also explains why only rufus usb flash drives were booting.view solution in original postif you haven't run a thorough diagnostic on the hard drive, that's next (f12 at powerup to access -- run the extended, not just the 10 minute quick -- test). i’ll try it tomorrow since it’s after midnight and i will tell you the results. i don’t think there is an issue with the drive since linux can see and read it during the live mode and so does the bios. what i find odd is how my usb won’t boot and will give the same error unless i’ve made it using rufus.this is why you need to do a complete surface test of the drive.  if the boot sector is written to a part of the drive that has developed bad sectors, exactly what you've described will be the result.i’ll do that now.but if that’s the issue, then why won’t it boot any os on any usb i’ve flashed?the diagnostics have finished and they have reported 0 issues.so i found the issue. most modern operating system like windows and linux, when on legacy computers, they use the gpt partition table with a compatibility layer called bios boot that emulates the master boot record partition table. this works perfectly fine on most computers except this. the solution was to force linux to install using the mbr partition table and for grub to only install legacy support and not efi. that also explains why only rufus usb flash drives were booting.\n",

      "content: hi. seen a lot of people reporting this same intermittent trackpad freeze issue and to be honest i put up with it for almost a year thinking it was just a software update that dell would eventually address, but it isn't.  it's a hardware issue.  the mouse pointer would randomly freeze for no discernable reason, then start working again in 10 or 15 seconds.  while the trackpad was frozen, the touchscreen worked fine. the bios diagnostics were always clean and i tried every \"solution\" i read online about it. i tried updating drivers, purchasing a new power supply, only running it on battery,  updating the bios, resetting trackpad settings, changing the mouse pointer speed, cleaning the ribbon cables, changing the settings, uninstalling/reinstalling the mouse drivers, uninstalling/reinstalling the trackpad drivers, none of it made a difference.  it was very frustrating i came close to purging my data and just throwing out the laptop several times. if you are pulling your hair out with the same problem do yourself a favor, bite the bullet and get the trackpad swapped out.  the solution was to call dell and have them send a technician to physically replace the trackpad itself with a new (non-refurbished) one.  he came to the house and swapped it out in about 30 minutes.  the trackpad isn't just a plastic peripheral, there are some electronics built into the back side of it and i personally think there's a bad batch of them floating around in the wild.  there is something different about the chipset installed in the new trackpad hardware when compared with the old trackpad hardware.  i say that because once the new trackpad hardware was installed and the laptop booted it recognized it as a new peripheral and a completely different driver was needed.  it found new hardware with a different name and needed two new updates installed.  it's great now and works perfectly.  i wish i'd done it when i first purchased the laptop.  have a great day.  the system setup(bios) and drivers need to be updated on most brand new computers.i would like to suggest you first update the system setup (bios), then after the drivers. please click on the links below and enter your service tag number. download the bios require onto the system and install it. \n",

      "content: hello guys,my dell laptop, won't boot properly and stuck in autorepair screen, with no success.i tried some of the options, rebooting - command prompt etc, with no success either!is there any hope? any ideas are more than welcoming!*dell inspiron 3567, win10 (all updates dec 2022)if you haven't run a full diagnostic (including the extended diagnostic on the hard drive or ssd), that's first - f12 at powerup.if everything passes (including the extended drive diagnostic -- allow several hours for this if it's a spinning hard drive  and not an ssd), about the only thing you can try is either a repair install from bootable media or a complete reinstall. thak you for your response ...run the f12 diagnostic test, and detects major hard disk problem, \"short self test unsuccessful\".and the hard disk should be replaced .... (oopssss!)that's about what i thought you'd find.  the system will also take a 2.5\" sata ssd, which is a much better option from both performance and reliability standpoints than replacing with another hard drive.with 1t ssds from respected manufacturers (wd, crucial, samsung, others) going for well under $100, there's little or no reason to settle for a spinning hard drive. press and hold the power button for 15 to 20 seconds to drain residual power. connect the ac adapter or power cable and the battery (for dell laptops). if your dell computer can turn on but is unable to boot into windows, identify the symptoms and follow the appropriate troubleshooting guide.\n",

output.access to working device drivers should not be warranty exclusive.it looks like that on my machine the intel thunderbolt update was installed  through windows update service earlier in november 2021. because of that the system didn't apply \"intel-thunderbolt-controller-driver_tbtc0_win_1.41.1193.0_a11.exe\" for alienware m17 r4 package. strange that output was \"fatal error\". i would expect something like \"the same version is already installed\".   please can you post a solution so dont have to raise tickets ... seems like a common problem i received the replacement system which is a refurb inspiron 5510 on 01-11-2021 in exchange of  a faulty inspiron 5502 i originally had.been using it for 2 days now, noticed an issue and contacted customer support. so far no luck with the issue, brief about the issue-i have 2 external monitors connected to this system1st monitor via hdmi to hdmi2nd monitor via usb-type c to hdmi.whenever a system is on sleep for little while or when system is restarted, the 2nd monitor connected via usb-c to hdmi dont come up. i have to manually unplug the usb c chord from the machine  and plug back in to make it work, which is super annoying. i tried the customer support few times 1st they did some troubleshooting with resolution settings, that fixed nothing.2nd they asked me to completely perform a clean install of the os( windows 11) that didn't help at all either.3rd finally one of the tech supervisors took the remote access to troubleshoot the issue and was trying to install this thunderbolt controller driver but it kept giving this fetal error 0x80070643. after which they promised at home service in which they will replace the motherboard and if that dont fix the issue they will replace it with another unit. but after going through this thread, i am thinking that this issue that i am having may or may not be something that is related to thunderbolt controller driver update. is anyone facing similar issue as i mentioned above and has anyone tried any thing that might have fixed the issue.date above should have been 01-11-22. sorry about the typo.\n",

      "content: hi everyone,got a dell inspiron 5570 gen 8 i3 laptop and the mouse keeps freezing.drivers are fine, re-installing windows did not help - had to as hard disk failed.updated to latest bios version instinctively  (now can't downgrade as it is blocked), and still the same problem.the touchpad even freezes on bios/during windows install so don't think it is drivers/windows related anymore.checked connections and they are fine as well.any ideas how it can be resolved.the same issue happens with my inspiron 5570, even after i updated all drivers. the frequency when the touchpad freezes change from 1 to many seconds and i need to lift my finger for around 8 seconds in order to bring it back to movement. it happens even while i'm in the bios. scrolling (two fingers) and buttons keep working properly while the issue happens.try to check if the following are working correctly:1. whether the shortcut switch is turned off2. whether the device is disabled3. if reinstalling the driver is still useless, think about whether the notebook can be used after updating the system or replacing the system. if it cannot be used, you need to check whether the notebook model supports the current system.100% hardware ( manufacturing fault or bios issue) - dell has been unhelpful as the unit is out of warranty by 6 months. their support don't read messages and standard reply!no good will gesture by them either as it is a reasonable expectation that a laptop would last longer than 1.5 years, especially when it is lightly used, and from a reputable brand like dell. i have had owned several laptops that lasted more than 5 years. we still have in possession 4th gen hp laptop, 6th gen lenovo and 3rd gen toshiba laptop which are working without any issues. in fact, not even one laptop has developed a fault or failed during our ownership – given them to others when we upgraded. dell seems to have issues (hard disk failed) or touch pad not working.fact of the matter is that 1.5 years is not a reasonable time for the average use and life span of that product, which is still in pristine condition. it suggests something may have been wrong with it at the very beginning – was never a merchantable quality, satisfactory quality, sufficiently durable, or free from any defects. dell not only sold a defective laptop but also showed no after care! i updated the bios and restored default setting. seems to be working now.i have the exact same issue with the same system dell inspiron 5570 (intel core i7 8th generation, 16 gb ram), trackpad mouse hangs for a few seconds then system shuts down for no apparent reason. thought it was related to radeon graphics driver update initially but after disabling this device the issue kept happening... dell support useless, not interested in helping once your one year warranty up, despite the fact that this laptop cost me over €1200. typical of these tech companies.....\n",

      "content: after updating the bios of my dell g15 5525 laptop to version 1.4.3, the laptop starts slow when using the battery. but starts normal when connected to the charger?. hi @giovanfrancis welcome to this free user-to-user alienware laptop discussion forum. please download dell g15 5525 system bios version 1.4.3 file onto your os (c:) boot drive. dell g15 5525 system bios | driver details | dell us. please remember to verify the checksum value to ensure the integrity of your download file and then install again. thank you. if that fix does not work, you cannot downgrade the bios to version 1.4.0 or earlier due to downgrade restrictions.  bios version 1.4.3 is the version that has startup problems, version 1.3.9 had no problems in that regard. they should fix the problem in future updatesyes, i am having the same problem too. i am at bios 1.4.3 already for g15 5525.i never had any issue on starting up (by opening the cover) until this latest bios update. please help find a solution, dell. all g15 5525 users should update to the bios 1.6.1 released on december 23, 2022.fixes & enhancements- fixed the issue where the system takes longer to boot on battery mode. this issue occurs on systems with the nvidia rtx 3050 or 3050 ti graphics cards.if still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session.find your service tag. reboot to bios (f2) >> post behavior > fastboot. if it's set on thorough, change it2. you can disconnect main battery and cmos battery to reset firmware yes, this issue irritates me a lot. it takes a lot of time to start. i have updated the bios to version 1.6.1. but it still takes around 54-55 secs for the login page to appear. and sometimes 80-90 secs. and i think this is not acceptable when your system has 16 gb ram and 512 ssd. and nothing works os clean and reset, factory reset nothing. it will just waste your time.\n",

      "content: *apologies if this is a repeat post. got a system error message trying to put this up the first time. oh, the irony.... hey all.looking for some help. this has got me pulling out what little hair i have.even when walking from only 2-3 feet away, people can barely hear me though the built-in mic. as i'm taking an online class full-time over the summer, this is a problem. my troubleshooting so far - confirmed mic turned all the way up in app (zoom and google meets)tested mic in app, confirmed quiet recordingconfirmed mic turned all the way up in the systemtested mic in system, confirmed quite recordingturned off all fancy background sound-canceling features. tested again, same results.tested mic level with both microphone array and same as system selected. no difference.uninstalled the device and reinstalled via check for hardware changesdownloaded latest drivers from dell and did a manual install i am out of ideas and turning to you good folks for help. a quick rant: i'm actually on my second brand new vostro 7590 - first was replaced under warranty the day i got it because the fan wouldn't stop running on high. my laptop before this was a $260 best buy refurb asus with an i3. it lasted five+ years with zero problems. all i did to it was upgrade to an ssd and add another 4gig stick of ram. this dell has been nothing but problems. it boots up slower than the i3 (yes, all but a few essential startup items are disabled) and is much slower to come back to life from sleep. then there was the heating issue resulting in a replacement machine. then i spent an entire day trying to figure out why i was only getting 1.87mbps - turned out smartbyte was the culprit so that got deleted. this replacement unit still runs super hot and thermo throttles playing a f'''ing youtube video. and now this microphone bs. i'm really hoping this is just user error, or else this garbage is probably going to be returned. i too have this problem and have tried some of the solutions you have tried - no luck. the windows settings-> system-> sound-> input-> device properties (microphone array)-> start test with volume set to 100%, and it reports a maximum level of 4% when talking fairly loudly from a distance of 10-12 inches.machine arrived june 11, 2020. i tried to use it on a zoom session on june 16 but had to switch to an old tablet so i could be heard.i wish dell had a \"me-too\" button, not that that would do much good. i'm going to try the service route but i don't hold out much hope.i've had the same problem and tried the same corrective actions.i bought my vostro in feb, and had no problem with the mic - mostly for zoom meetings - up through a zoom graduation party on 6/14.i discovered the problem with low volume on a zoom meeting 6/21, but i didn't troubleshoot.  it was still there for a zoom meeting 6/28 (today).after giving up on troubleshooting, i checked the support assist history and found that the realtek audio drive and dell bios updates among others, were installed 6/15.i will contact dell tech support and take advantage of my high-priced warranty.i am having the same problem as all of you. please let me know if you find any fix. @dons47 a dell tech has been assigned.  i responded to a request for background info.it might be helpful for you to check what windows updates occurred before you discovered the problem.i my case, i saw only the new edge installation. user daniminson confirmed problem was caused by the installation of realtek audio driver a06:\"yes, the problem started when i installed the realtek driver a06. to solve it, i needed to reinstall windows and not install the audio driver, letting windows do it.\"  thanks to the hint from dons47 and daniminson that the problem is with the realtek a06 driver, i went to the vostro driver page (https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/vostro-15-7590-laptop/drivers) and changed the category to audio. clicked the down arrow on the first entry (version 6.0.8940.1 a06) and you'll see a link to older versions. click on the link and you'll see two older versions. download the 6.0.8777.1 a05 version and run it. it'll do two reboots, one to uninstall the old version and another to install the new version. you'll also have to confirm that you want to use an older driver. the microphone now works properly.the problem now will be that whenever supportassist runs, it will probably want to download the latest level. i'll have to watch out for that.i wonder how long it will take dell to put out a fixed driver. i would think dell is seeing a lot of audio problems on machines that use the realtek a06 driver. it would be in their best interest to fix it quickly.thanks, applev, for step-by-step!7/8 update from dell tech support:\"we just got an update from our product engineering team. they informed us that the issue has been escalated further. they might come up with a new driver to tackle this. they have not given us an eta yet.\" meanwhile, my laptop mic works great, but windows won't recognize my headphones! <arrgh>@applev thanks for the mic repair instructions, worked perfectly! unfortunately now our system audio output is extremely low. will post a solution if found.\n",

      "content: hello everyone. i've been reading the vostro 5490 user guide and also the w19/d6000/etc docks documentation to see if i can connect at least two external fhd screens, but, i confess, i was unable to identify if there is compatibility between my new laptop and any dock station model from dell to do this (in addition to the dock also charging the laptop battery, of course, by usb-c dp/pd connector). i was also quite surprised not to find the vostro 5490 in the list of compatible computers in the documentation for the dell docks, but i still believe in miracles. so, could someone help me solve this? thank you guys and stay safe.solved!go to solution.@zielpunkt  the d6000 is a \"universal\" dock, because it will work with any system that has displaylink \"indirect display\" software installed -- although it will only charge systems that actually support that.  so it doesn't have an official compatibility list, because that would even include non-dell and even non-windows systems.  however, since displaylink has drawbacks that can be significant in some use cases, i don't recommend it in your case, since your system supports usb-c displayport alt mode, which means you can use docks that tap into that native gpu output instead, such as the dell wd19.the reason the wd19 doesn't list vostro systems as \"fully supported\" is because that designation is reserved for systems that support some of the specialized features that can be used with that dock, which i'll get to in a moment.  all of them require firmware-level support from the attached system, and at least for now, dell seems to be including that only in latitude, precision, and xps systems, while leaving the inspiron, vostro, and alienware systems out in the cold.  however, if you don't care about those features and just want the standard functionality, you don't have to worry about it.  the specialized features include such as mac address passthrough, pxe boot, and the ability to use the dock's power button to control the system.  if you don't know what the first two are, don't worry about them.  that last one is admittedly a nice perk, and it's irritating that dell hasn't implemented support for using the dock's power button with other systems, but at least for now, that isn't possible -- and it won't be possible from other docks either.  there's no industry standard for an external power button (as of this writing), so that's just something you won't be able to use with that system, no matter what dock you get.but again, if you just want standard dock functionality, such as video output, system charging, usb, ethernet, audio, etc., the wd19 will be able to deliver that even with systems not on its list.  my wife uses a wd19 with a lenovo laptop, for example.  getting standard functionality out of a wd19 just requires a system with a usb-c port that supports usb 3.x, video output, and system charging.  looking at the specs of the vostro 5490, its usb-c port definitely supports usb 3.1 gen 1 and displayport alt mode (video output), but it's not clear whether it supports charging.  the product page mentions support for power delivery, but that's ambiguous because usb pd can supply power in both directions, and not all systems support using that spec in both directions.  if you want to test it out, plug a 45w or higher usb-c power source into your system and see if it charges.  if it doesn't support charging via usb-c, you won't damage anything, but it also means that no usb-c dock will be able to charge your system that way either.  but if it does support usb-c charging, note that the specs of the vostro 5490 indicate that it can come with either a 45w or 65w adapter.  the difference probably depends on whether your system has an nvidia gpu.  check the wattage of the adapter that came with your system.  you'd ideally want a dock that provides at least that amount of power.  the regular wd19 130w can supply up to 90w of power to the attached system (so you don't need the wd19 180w that can supply up to 130w to the system), so you're good there.  the d6000 can only supply 60w, though.  if your vostro has a 65w adapter, the 5w shortfall probably won't make a noticeable difference in terms of battery charging speed or performance, but it might trigger a warning about an undersized power adapter when your system boots -- but that warning can be disabled by pressing a key that will be mentioned in that warning.but regardless of what happens with charging, your system will be able to run dual fhd displays through a \"native gpu\" usb-c dock like the wd19.  but that's as high as you'll be able to go, due to bandwidth limitations on usb-c and the fact that your system's gpu only supports displayport hbr2, not the newer hbr3 standard.  if you want to go with higher-end display setups, such as dual qhd or triple anything, that actually would make a case for the d6000, since one of the perks of its displaylink technology is that since it transmits video as compressed usb data, it can run more and higher resolution displays than would normally be possible.  it can also exceed the maximum display limit of your gpu (which is 3), because the displays aren't technically driven by the gpu.  but again, that has its drawbacks, which i've written about in the post marked in the answer here.i realize that was probably a lot to digest, so here's the bottom line:hopefully this helps!view solution in original postthank you! we have received the required details. we will work towards a resolution via private

into that native gpu output instead, such as the dell wd19.the reason the wd19 doesn't list vostro systems as \"fully supported\" is because that designation is reserved for systems that support some of the specialized features that can be used with that dock, which i'll get to in a moment.  all of them require firmware-level support from the attached system, and at least for now, dell seems to be including that only in latitude, precision, and xps systems, while leaving the inspiron, vostro, and alienware systems out in the cold.  however, if you don't care about those features and just want the standard functionality, you don't have to worry about it.  the specialized features include such as mac address passthrough, pxe boot, and the ability to use the dock's power button to control the system.  if you don't know what the first two are, don't worry about them.  that last one is admittedly a nice perk, and it's irritating that dell hasn't implemented support for using the dock's power button with other systems, but at least for now, that isn't possible -- and it won't be possible from other docks either.  there's no industry standard for an external power button (as of this writing), so that's just something you won't be able to use with that system, no matter what dock you get.but again, if you just want standard dock functionality, such as video output, system charging, usb, ethernet, audio, etc., the wd19 will be able to deliver that even with systems not on its list.  my wife uses a wd19 with a lenovo laptop, for example.  getting standard functionality out of a wd19 just requires a system with a usb-c port that supports usb 3.x, video output, and system charging.  looking at the specs of the vostro 5490, its usb-c port definitely supports usb 3.1 gen 1 and displayport alt mode (video output), but it's not clear whether it supports charging.  the product page mentions support for power delivery, but that's ambiguous because usb pd can supply power in both directions, and not all systems support using that spec in both directions.  if you want to test it out, plug a 45w or higher usb-c power source into your system and see if it charges.  if it doesn't support charging via usb-c, you won't damage anything, but it also means that no usb-c dock will be able to charge your system that way either.  but if it does support usb-c charging, note that the specs of the vostro 5490 indicate that it can come with either a 45w or 65w adapter.  the difference probably depends on whether your system has an nvidia gpu.  check the wattage of the adapter that came with your system.  you'd ideally want a dock that provides at least that amount of power.  the regular wd19 130w can supply up to 90w of power to the attached system (so you don't need the wd19 180w that can supply up to 130w to the system), so you're good there.  the d6000 can only supply 60w, though.  if your vostro has a 65w adapter, the 5w shortfall probably won't make a noticeable difference in terms of battery charging speed or performance, but it might trigger a warning about an undersized power adapter when your system boots -- but that warning can be disabled by pressing a key that will be mentioned in that warning.but regardless of what happens with charging, your system will be able to run dual fhd displays through a \"native gpu\" usb-c dock like the wd19.  but that's as high as you'll be able to go, due to bandwidth limitations on usb-c and the fact that your system's gpu only supports displayport hbr2, not the newer hbr3 standard.  if you want to go with higher-end display setups, such as dual qhd or triple anything, that actually would make a case for the d6000, since one of the perks of its displaylink technology is that since it transmits video as compressed usb data, it can run more and higher resolution displays than would normally be possible.  it can also exceed the maximum display limit of your gpu (which is 3), because the displays aren't technically driven by the gpu.  but again, that has its drawbacks, which i've written about in the post marked in the answer here.i realize that was probably a lot to digest, so here's the bottom line:hopefully this helps!@jphugan, first of all, i believe dell should pay for your posts, which turn into effective lessons about their products and are certainly much (much) more enlightening and didactic than the answers given by dell support employees. in my case, i intend to use 2 fhd displays for office tasks because i know that dock stations don't currently offer acceptable image quality and performance for anything else (rendering, games or videos). for example, i have a desktop workstation where i use applications like altium designer and solidworks and on it i have 3 samsumg u28e590d 4k displays with nvidea quadro k1200 dp graphics card, which gives me results i would never expect from a laptop like my vostro 5490 and any dock. returning to the subject, i understood perfectly your excellent explanation about the video technologies used in a d6000 and w19 and its implications and restrictions in each case. so, the w19 should be my choice, as it adapts correctly to the gpu output via usb-c and easily drives at least 2 common fhd displays. as for the vostro 5490 accepting or not being powered/charged by usb-c/pd, i will try to find a suitable charger for this test, but it will not be easy (i live in brazil, where nothing is very easy or cheap...). even so, i will also try to get a specific and objective answer from dell about this (yes, i know, they are watching us this moment). in conclusion, i believe it is clear to many people that dell does not offer enough documentation for the user to understand for himself whether a simple usb-c connector can be used to power/charge the system. and this is not a problem exclusive to dell and it seems to me that technology companies, in general, do not mind delegating the task of writing manuals to inexperienced people. thank you so much for the free training and your time, @jphugan! i will keep you informed about results.@zielpunkt  thanks for the kind words!  i've worked in various it roles over the years, and i'm a tech hobbyist in general, so contributing to forums like this is sort of my \"pro bono\" work to help do some good in the world. in terms of your post, first you should understand that a dock does not inherently have an adverse effect on image quality.  the d6000 is a special case since it uses displaylink, which uses compression and therefore can introduce compression artifacts and motion judder, as i explained in the thread i linked.  but the wd19 relies on a native gpu output from the usb-c port, which is literally just a displayport interface from the gpu with the pins physically arranged differently to suit a usb-c connector rather than a displayport connector.  so connecting displays through a wd19 or any other dock would be exactly the same as connecting a display to a displayport or hdmi output on a laptop.  (for systems with discrete gpus, there's an additional question of which gpu controls the output, which can have some impact on available technologies, but that's a larger discussion -- which i wrote up in the post marked as the answer in this thread if you're really curious -- but even that doesn't affect image quality.)  but it is absolutely possible to use dock-connected displays for rendering, games, etc.  people do it all the time and have done for years, because again as long as you're tapping into a native gpu output rather than using \"indirect display\" technology like displaylink, the dock is no different from connecting a display directly to the system.that said, your vostro 5490 simply doesn't offer the gpu outputs needed to drive triple 4k displays.  but that's not the fault of any dock.  it's just that the system doesn't offer the needed outputs.in terms of dell's specs not being very detailed, i've raised that very issue with an internal dell support contact, who has been able to get that feedback to the documentation team.  the ambiguity around \"power delivery\" is one of those issues, and the other is the supported displayport revision on usb-c, since dell often just mentions \"displayport\".  the revision matters because it affects how much video bandwidth is available and therefore the types of display setups that can be run through a dock.  and it seems that things may be changing for the better.  for example, the recently launched xps 15 9500 and xps 17 9700 have specs that specifically mention displayport 1.2 or displayport 1.4 rather than just displayport.  (unfortunately the displayport support spec for the xps 15 9500 is incorrect on one of its ports and the spec for the xps 17 9700 is incomplete since it doesn't account for the effect of a special bios mode, but at least dell is trying to move in the right direction here, i suppose.)@jphughan, thanks again for your attention, you can believe you have been doing a great job. it became even more clear to me the issues of reproduction of the video signals that the docks can deal, also due to the video stage architecture/composition of the laptops in general. as i said i would, few minutes ago i had a chat with brazilian's dell support and its \"expert\" also had a lot of difficulty in giving me an assertive answer regarding the usb-c/pd being able to charge/power my vostro 5490. i will not transcribe the conversation here, as it is relatively long, but in the end he said he \"believes\" that i won't have a problem with that and also that if i buy the w19 and it doesn't charge/power my laptop, dell would accept its return. he also said he will recommend that more consistent information on this matter be added to dell's documentation. let's wait to see. so, as i received a copy of that chat by email and this commitment stated in it, i'm going to buy w19 dock station. when receiving and testing, i will report the results. regards.hi @zielpunkt , have you bought the wd19 in the end? does it work with the vostro 5490? does it charge the laptop just fine? i have the same laptop and wondered if buying the wd19 was worth it or not. thanks!    hi @fabulinux, sorry for the big delay in replying, too many things to deal with in a short time. in the end, i didn't buy the wd19 because i reassessed the cost against the risks and concluded that it wasn't essential for me. so unfortunately i can't help you at this point, but keep me posted if you buy it. good luck and happy new year.the specialized features include such as mac address passthrough, pxe boot, and the ability to use the dock's power button to control the system.  if you don't know what the first two are, don't worry about them.  that last one is admittedly a nice perk, and it's irritating that dell hasn't implemented support for using the dock's power button with other systems, but at least for now, that isn't possible -- and it won't be possible from other docks either.  there's no industry standard for an external power button (as of this writing), so that's just something you won't be able to use with that system, no matter what dock you get.just for case if anybody wants to buy this dell usb-c dock. i confirm that combo dell wd 19tbs + dell vostro 5471 (i5, vga intel + radeon 530) can 100% work together, even the poweroff button works. there were some updates for usb-c during last two years, so i maybe it has been resolved with theme. i was worried about it before i buy that dock. so everything is great.  kr\n",

      "content of solution: @Zielpunkt  The D6000 is a \"universal\" dock, because it will work with any system that has DisplayLink \"indirect display\" software installed -- although it will only charge systems that actually support that.  So it doesn't have an official compatibility list, because that would even include non-Dell and even non-Windows systems.  However, since DisplayLink has drawbacks that can be significant in some use cases, I don't recommend it in your case, since your system supports USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode, which means you can use docks that tap into that native GPU output instead, such as the Dell WD19.The reason the WD19 doesn't list Vostro systems as \"fully supported\" is because that designation is reserved for systems that support some of the specialized features that can be used with that dock, which I'll get to in a moment.  All of them require firmware-level support from the attached system, and at least for now, Dell seems to be including that only in Latitude, Precision, and XPS systems, while leaving the Inspiron, Vostro, and Alienware systems out in the cold.  However, if you don't care about those features and just want the standard functionality, you don't have to worry about it.  The specialized features include such as MAC Address Passthrough, PXE Boot, and the ability to use the dock's Power button to control the system.  If you don't know what the first two are, don't worry about them.  That last one is admittedly a nice perk, and it's irritating that Dell hasn't implemented support for using the dock's Power button with other systems, but at least for now, that isn't possible -- and it won't be possible from other docks either.  There's no industry standard for an external Power button (as of this writing), so that's just something you won't be able to use with that system, no matter what dock you get.But again, if you just want standard dock functionality, such as video output, system charging, USB, Ethernet, audio, etc., the WD19 will be able to deliver that even with systems not on its list.  My wife uses a WD19 with a Lenovo laptop, for example.  Getting standard functionality out of a WD19 just requires a system with a USB-C port that supports USB 3.x, video output, and system charging.  Looking at the specs of the Vostro 5490, its USB-C port definitely supports USB 3.1 Gen 1 and DisplayPort Alt Mode (video output), but it's not clear whether it supports charging.  The product page mentions support for Power Delivery, but that's ambiguous because USB PD can supply power in both directions, and not all systems support using that spec in both directions.  If you want to test it out, plug a 45W or higher USB-C power source into your system and see if it charges.  If it doesn't support charging via USB-C, you won't damage anything, but it also means that no USB-C dock will be able to charge your system that way either.  But if it DOES support USB-C charging, note that the specs of the Vostro 5490 indicate that it can come with either a 45W or 65W adapter.  The difference probably depends on whether your system has an NVIDIA GPU.  Check the wattage of the adapter that came with your system.  You'd ideally want a dock that provides at least that amount of power.  The regular WD19 130W can supply up to 90W of power to the attached system (so you don't need the WD19 180W that can supply up to 130W to the system), so you're good there.  The D6000 can only supply 60W, though.  If your Vostro has a 65W adapter, the 5W shortfall probably won't make a noticeable difference in terms of battery charging speed or performance, but it MIGHT trigger a warning about an undersized power adapter when your system boots -- but that warning can be disabled by pressing a key that will be mentioned in that warning.But regardless of what happens with charging, your system will be able to run dual FHD displays through a \"native GPU\" USB-C dock like the WD19.  But that's as high as you'll be able to go, due to bandwidth limitations on USB-C and the fact that your system's GPU only supports DisplayPort HBR2, not the newer HBR3 standard.  If you want to go with higher-end display setups, such as dual QHD or triple anything, that actually WOULD make a case for the D6000, since one of the perks of its DisplayLink technology is that since it transmits video as compressed USB data, it can run more and higher resolution displays than would normally be possible.  It can also exceed the maximum display limit of your GPU (which is 3), because the displays aren't technically driven by the GPU.  But again, that has its drawbacks, which I've written about in the post marked in the answer here.I realize that was probably a lot to digest, so here's the bottom line:\n",

      "If you'd be ok being limited to dual FHD displays max, go with the WD19.  If not, the D6000 would be worth considering if you don't think the drawbacks would apply to you.  Just remember that you might have to disable that warning about undersized power sources (assuming your system supports USB-C charging at all and it's designed for a 65W power source).\n",

      "content: i've purchased 5401 i5 version - the laptop works fine when connected to power. i can control the modes and make in quiet and slow or noisy and fast. but not on battery - as soon as my cable is disconnected laptop ignores the os settings and forces to quet low speed mode. the only way to make it usable again is to plug the cable.latest bios installed, tried resetting to factory and bios defaults etc.same behavior in windows and ubuntu (pre-installed) - so looks like it is bios bug...  thank you! we have received the required details. we will work towards a resolution. in the meantime, you may also receive assistance or suggestions from the community members.#iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".hello dell cares,instead of always giving your canned replies why dont you provide some solutions to your customers instead of the customers helping other customers.your dell support is lousy it does not even exist. vostro 15 359010th generation intel core i7-10510uprocessor (8mb cache, up to 4.9ghz)amd radeon 610 series (2g gddr5 graphic memory)hi there,as per the diagnosis, we've identified that the system hardware is working fine. for the issue to be resolved, as we have limited support for ubuntu operating system, you may check on the open source platformhttps://dell.to/2j2knp3#iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".hardware does not give errors - but it works terrible. when disconnecting the battery it works ok almost until 70-75% of capacity and then dramatically slows down. no overheat or errors - but it becomes unsable, like i do not have 10gen anymore but returned to the era of pentium ii.  even if i reboot , even reboot different os - no matter windows, pre-installed ubuntu or some live-usb - it continues to run slow. until i plug the cable in. or - charge battery almost to 100%. as i do not have any error message - it does not overheat, does not report any issue - seems that it is a feature that dell implemented intentionally. and it is not in os - i boot several os's with the same results. so it is either hardware or bios (my bios is latest) - and for me it makes absolutely unusable as i use laptop most on battery.   i still hope for some fixes in bios but looks like i need new pc.looks like it is not a feature but a bug. finally i set up several runs on ubintu with unigine tropics benchmark loading gpu. the test run was simple - charge 100%, run benchmark, unplug power.then the rhings go weird. up to 75% of battery it runs full speed as set by ubuntu. but on 75% speed drops about 4 times, cpu get 400-500mhz, gpu 150-300 ( even below the minimum 300 set by os). barely moving. and this goes till 45% of battery when - unbelievable - the speed returns back, cpu and gpu come to the normal frequencies and things continue fine. maybe there are some more magical numbers back and forth but after 40% i plugged the power in, charged to 100% and the cycle of 75-45 was repeated again.so hopefully in the next releases of bios this buggy 75-45 region will be fixed hi there,have you tried to flash previous version of the bios and checked if that makes any difference?#iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".hello. we are waiting for your revert. do write to us at your convenience for further assistance, until then we shall archive the case.#iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".i can confirm this is still an issue with the latest bios v1.16.0.i unplugged both the main and cmos batteries for a bit and it seems to be working fine now. no more throttling between 75% and 45% battery.\n",

      "content: i'm very disappointed with the windows hello fingerprint feature which always has problems on my dell vostro 14-5410 laptop. many times my fingerprint reader crashes with a warning saying \"we could not find a fingerprint scanner compatible with windows hello fingerprint\". and now, it's been 3 weeks i can no longer use the fingerprint scanner on my laptop. i have to login using pin/password instead of using fingerprint. this is very frustrating for me because there is no way on the internet to fix this problem. this fingerprint scanner problem always occurs whenever i update windows in windows settings, or update drivers in the dell support assist application. why don't you make the windows hello fingerprint scanner work like on a smartphone (android or old iphone) that never has a problem and is always reliable. always works without crashing \"we couldn't find a fingerprint scanner compatible with your device\".\n",

is it the original cable? if it is, then it cannot be too short. if the touchpad previously worked, then the cable is not too short.did you replace it? check the contacts at the end of the cable. do they look perfect? if they look chewed up or some of the metal strips have shredded or folded back, then you would need a new cable. you could check with parts-people.com to ask them, though they don't have a touchpad in stock for your model. you could ask about just a cable. you could also ask dell, if it's a relatively recent model. i made both suggestions in my first post.view solution in original postit sounds as though your system does not detect the touchpad. the cable should not be loose in the connector. as it's loose, that may be the problem, since the system can't get a consistent signal through the touchpad cable and motherboard connector.on older dell laptops i've seen, many such cables also had a stiff blue pull tab at each end. if the blue pull tab has detached, the cable won't have the necessary thickness to seat tightly in the connector.i recently worked on an 11-year-old inspiron. the blue pull tab fell off a ribbon cable when i opened the connector, perhaps due to the adhesive aging and becoming brittle. i used a drop of superglue to refasten the blue pull tab to the cable, after which the cable held securely in the connector.if you cannot find the blue pull tab, you will need to find a similar material to fasten to stiffen and thicken the cable to make it suitable for reconnection.you could contact parts-people or dell to see if you can buy just the cable.the cable is purple, and the conectors have like a little held black piece that is little loose, but i think the problem its the cable. very similar to this cable, but purple/pinkish'.the connector is hinged and flips open or closed. you must flip up a hinged flap on the connector, then carefully slide the cable out of the connector. to reconnect it, carefully slide the cable into the connector, making sure it's fully inserted. then flip the hinged flap down to lock the cable in place.when closed, the cable must fit snugly. if it's loose, that's a problem. if you think both ends of the cable have the stiff pull tab intact, then perhaps try adding a piece of tape or something to help it fit more tightly in the connector.if the hinged flap on the connector is missing or broken, the cable will never fit securely unless you tape it down or replace the hinge (which you'd need to get from another motherboard, there are youtube videos showing how to do it).until the cable fits snugly in the connector, so that the contacts on both cable and connector form a good connection, it will not function.yeah, the touchpad hinged flap seems a little loose, i will try to put a tape (is there no danger of the tape melting? which tape would be good to use?)the flat cable looks little shorts, that could be the problem... i will try this solution first.can you send me the videos? just to get some knowledge.for videos, it depends upon what you're trying to do. google:replace ribbon cable connector flap - google searchif it's loose even when the flap is fully closed, you may need to add a strip of paper or plastic on top of the cable to make it fit more tightly. if the flap doesn't close properly, that's a different issue.for tape, even regular electrical tape would likely be okay since it's not in a high heat area. that tape is good to 80° c. for higher heat locations you would need special heat resistant tapes.how could the cable be too short?

      "content: hello guys, i hope you are doing well i am a sys admin for a it company and i have a lot of vostro 5502 laptops and they all have same problem.so right on the topic for today. often laptop couldn't detect wired headphones when i plug them in. i have my pc updated like bios, windows build and drivers, realtek driver is latest version, waves maxx audio etc. all up-to date.and problem appears periodically again and again, and every time i have to restart the pc (sometimes with headphones attached), disable/enable audio driver, or repair wavesmaxxaudio (which not working at 90% of the cases) or just reinstall realtek.worst part is that this happens always in my colleague meetings and i cannot just restart the pc on the middle of a meeting. i honestly think the problem is with wavesmaxxaudio because sometimes even when i install it from store it couldn't even start because of codec issues. i know i have the right codecs. even i have installed k-lite mega pack codecs. the app is enabled on start up but sometimes just refuse to work.so is there any permanent solution for this kind of issue cause i couldn't find any proper of different ways to deal with this problem.the most productive way to fight with this which i figured out is to reinstall realtek driver with headphones attached to the pc.but bottom line is this app is problematic and does not working correctly. p.s. vostro 5510 has this same problem very rarely.\n",

      "content: seen a couple of posts regarding this but not see a solution.we're having a consistent issues with the dell vostro 3515, we started using these laptops a coupl eof months ago we have around 40 all experiencing the same issue.these are fresh built win10 deployments, but every single one is having issues where the external screen they've got plugged in drops off.the vega 8 video driver is listed under display adaptors, however it's in disabled state. you have to go into uninstallation of the driver, reinstall and mostly it'll work - for a bit. we have tried installing the driver directly from dells website and directly with amd.it's drawing in complaints from users multiple times a day, almost every day, to the extent it's causing mass issues across the board.we deploy our baseline os image via sccm.we have tried on 21h2 and windows 11 also.we have tried changing the power management settings, reinstalling the driver, updating the bios and all other drivers to the latest versions., resetting the os and manually domain integrating to avoid deploying our pre built image.  any help would be much appreciated.ok so it looks like its sorted, annoyingly it was something so simple. when we downloaded the gpu driver from dells website, it automatically installs adrenaline and we updated it from there again to the latest version. we just downloaded the gpu driver from dells website then didn't update it further through adenaline just closed it and thats been stable for over 24 hours, the longest yet. so it looks good so far.. hi i have the same issue on vostro series we try same action but after some days, it's come backso i forgot to come back an update, shortly after they crashed again. at a loss for ideas now except for returning the devices and getting the intel variant.. \n",

      "content: tl;dr: is usb charging via thunderbolt port officially supported on vostro 7510? does dell sell a usb-c charger?i have used the thunderbolt port many times to charge the laptop (vostro 7510) while traveling in lieu of the ac port. this allows me to travel a bit lighter. i purchased a high-quality, 4-port, 100-watt usb wall charger (and 100-watt usb-c cable) so i could charge my phone, tablet and laptop as necessary. because the vostro uses a 130-watt input, i would sometimes see a \"slow charging\" warning, but this was not a big deal, maybe it would take 2 hours to charge instead of 1 or whatever.on my last trip, however, it all went bad. unfortunately i had to use the computer away from a plug and ran it all down to zero, such that the computer would not turn on at all. i plugged in the usb cord the laptop that night and assumed it was all fine, but the next day i realized it had not charged at all. then when i tried again to use the thunderbolt port to charge i could see that the small led light next to the thunderbolt was not coming on. i plugged in the same cable into my phone and it charged fine. only the vostro was not responding. what does the manual for your laptop say about this? the only thing the vostro 7510 manual says is that the computer contains \"one thunderbolt 4 port with displayport 1.4 and powerdelivery.\"intel's website (https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/upgrade-gaming-accessories-thunderbolt-4.ht...) says (emphasis mine): a thunderbolt™ port can do all three. it delivers high-speed data transfer, outputs a video signal, and can deliver power to compatible devices (including charging a lightweight laptop) simultaneously.therefore i would expect that charging my laptop via the usb-c thunderbolt port would be supported. the fact that it went totally dead and would not respond in any fashion (no charging, no lights, no power) to a 100-watt charger, would appear to be a malfunction.\n",

      "content: hi guys !i am running a configuration based on a vostro 7590 and a docking station wd19tb.the displays i am using are two dell monitors and one nec (connected via display port to vga adapter).all the displays are connected to the docking station:- dell 1 -> through dp - minidp cable (1920 x 1080 resolution)- dell 2 -> through hdmi - hdmi cable (1920 x 1080 resolution)- nec -> through dp - vga adapter (1680 x 1050 resolution)my issue is that i cannot run 4 monitors at a time. is there a hardware limitation for that docking station ?i tried to configure the monitors differently (using the hdmi port that my vostro has).while i was using my toshiba dynadock station i could easily run 4 displays including the build in monitor.now i am on ubuntu 20.04 and in comparison to the toshiba dock station every time i try to enable the fourth display it does not let me to apply the changes.i would be grateful for some advice in my problem, and hope that there is a solution to make my configuration run all 4 displays.cheers !what are the exact specs of your laptop (cpu and gpu)?the issue is most likely caused by the fact that integrated graphics in your cpu probably does not support more than 3 displays.@mk444cpu:  gpus:  the actual graphics card used by my system is the nvidia one which is listed in the about section of ubuntu:the drivers are at version 515: accoring to intel site your cpu supports up to 3 displays only:https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/191045/intel-core-i79750h-processor-12m-cache-u...i don't know about your old dock but a quick search suggests that toshiba dynadock uses displaylink which might be the reason why all 4 displays were functioning.wd19xx docks run display natively using displayport over usb-c, they do not have displaylink.so i assume there is no way to use wd19tb by any other way than a maximum of 3 displays (with different resolution) ?isn't there a way to make the hdmi port in the vostro to be used by the nvidia graphics so it could run an additional display? or make the built in monitor to use that dedicated graphics to display anything ?according to the earlier reply the docking station uses the internal graphics for processing the signal to the docking station through the thunderbolt interface and the maximum of 3 displays that are supported is the limit?so i assume there is no way to use wd19tb by any other way than a maximum of 3 displays (with different resolution) ?isn't there a way to make the hdmi port in the vostro to be used by the nvidia graphics so it could run an additional display? or make the built in monitor to use that dedicated graphics to display anything ?afaik on some systems it's possbile to switch output to dedicated gpu but don't know about yours - you'd need to check it but i doubt it's possbile on that vostro.in short yes but to be precise the docking station doesn't \"use\" integrated graphics - it only receives display signals. so it's not limit of your docking station but limit of your laptop's cpu which just doesn't handle more than 3 displays in total (it doesn't matter what ports you connect them to).i have tried that configuration just to be sure with it by unplugging one display and connecting it to the hdmi in the vostro - the effect is the same and only 3 displays can be enabled at a time.the thing is all the displays are being recognized by both ubuntu 20 and win 11 - that is why i asked is there a way to make the hdmi to be used by the dedicated nvidia graphics. i am guessing that would be the optimal solution to enable the extra monitor.hope that in the future there is going to be a solution to this issue. meanwhile i am going to have to live with those max 3 displays at my ho. plugging in one cable and being ready for work is a big advantage of this docking station.\n",

      "content: when i plugged the d6000 docking station into the usb or thunderbolt 4 port on my new vostro 7620 , the usb keyboard and mouse that are plugged into the docking station sometimes works for about 1 minute and then stops working.i unplugged the mouse and keyboard and then plug them back in, sometimes it works for about a minute, but then i get an error message the the usb device that was just connected is not recognized. the monitor that is plugged into the docking station works fine. to test the usb port on the docking station i plugged in a usb flash drive and it recognized the drive and i can read the files on the flash drive. all drivers are current as per the dell technician who remoted into my laptop and updated all drivers and bios. i got the docking station 3 -4 yrs ago when i was using my old dell inspiron 5521. when i plug the keyboard and mouse directly into the laptop, they work fine.the dell technician said my only alternative was to pay for a dell technician to look at my docking station since its past warranty. any suggestions?also, the docking station with the mouse, keyboard and monitor works fine with my old inspirion. hi, i am having the same problem, the dock works great with my old laptop (i tested with 3 laptos) but i have the same problem in dell vostro 7620. i have updated bios and everything.did you solve the problem? how?similar problem here. 2 year old vostro 7500 replaced by a vostro 7600 4 days ago. dock is a wd19tb. worked without problems on the 7500 but the 7600 causes all these lags. i'll type for 3 seconds and nothing happens then....vrooooop...all the typed words zip onto the screen. mouse scrolls lag. a bunch of other things lag, too. none of this happens when working of the integrated screen and keyboard. windows 11pro 64 on the 7600, windows 10pro 64 on the old 7500.every driver i could find has been updated, except the dock. i don't know how to auto update the dock drivers and the instructions on how to choose the right one and upload them manually scare me. if anyone has some tips in that area, would love to get those and maybe i'll try a driver update on the dock.i spent an hour on a call with dell hardware and they said all the hardware is working fine but they found a corrupted software file. of course, they pointed their finger at that and said i need to call dell software support and pay for it. <substitute character removed. tos73> was the gist of my response to that suggestion.i hope someone finds a common problem. what version of windows are you guys running? i think that's the problem. i've got 26 days left to return the 7600.try restoring bios in default same issue here.  we have tons of latitudes and d3100/d6000 docks.  we moved to the vostro line (7620) and i can confirm this is a problem with the vostro's only.  the rest of the laptops connected to these docks do not exhibit these issues.  the software configuration is the same:  fresh instance of windows 10, all drivers up to date, problems still exist.  i have created (and updated) a support ticket with dell but the responses are fairly typical.  for clarity here, these are the troubleshooting steps i provided to them (when asked):  may i know the exact or more symptoms and troubleshooting performed (if any)? the symptoms are as described in the ticket.  after an undefined period of time (could be 10 min, could be 2 hours) the usb devices attached to the dock stop working.  the monitors attached to the dock, via hdmi, however, continue to function.  the only way to get the usb devices working again is to either 1) physically unplug the dock from the laptop and plug it back in or 2) reboot the pctroubleshooting performed: installed a clean instance of windows 10installed displaylink drivers for dell d3100 dockdisabled power management features for usb root hub and usb host controller (allow computer to turn off this device to save power unchecked)disabled c-states in the biosupgraded bios to 1.6.1 (oct 13th  rev)installed v 10.1.18950.8298, a20 intel chipset softwareinstalled dell update application to ensure all drivers installed were present/good – no updates needing to be installed according to the application i responded to them several days ago but no reply.  i have a feeling dell is going to sweep this one under the rug and hide behind their off shore tech support.  i am still a fool, though, and remain hopeful they may come thru here.  the bottom line:  this is absolutely an issue with vostro hardware/bios configuration and is not a windows 10 / software configuration problem.    by the way, look at all the views on these posts.  dell?  where are you?? this reply probably doesn't help your situation because of the w10/w11 operating system difference, but when i did the massive w11 update about 3 weeks ago, this problem basically went away. bluetooth will still lock up once every few weeks, but i can live with that. i also updated all the bios and every other recommended update, but the w11 overhaul was the one that seemed to make a difference. thank you for coming back here and posting this update.  while some of our software vendors haven't adopted windows 11 as of yet, it's nice to know the upgrade appears to resolve this very frustrating issue.  appreciate it.  i have an update to share.  i submitted a support request with dell and after a bunch of back and forth, they offered to send me out a motherboard replacement.  knowing this would be a waste and not solve the problem, i asked to speak with a manager.  a day later, i was pleasantly surprised and received a phone call from an escalation analyst.  nice guy, wanted me to collect a bunch of logs, etc., but the end result was since we are running windows 10, the issue would need to be reproduced in windows 11 before they could help further.  understandable, dell can't possibly support every piece of software and hardware known to humankind.  this just meant i was left to troubleshoot this on my own.  that said, i am pleased to share this usb device issue is related to the nvidia driver provided by dell's site.  i will summarize below, if you need further details, let me know and i'll provide more instruction: disable the nvidia driver completely (good fix if the card is not needed for the end user as it conserves battery and helps prevent the pc from overheating when in s1 sleep state)  replace the driver provided by dell with one directly from nvidia  i hope this helps someone out there....  \n",

      "content: i have an odd problem with a vostro 3500 laptop. warranty ran out 10 months ago. plugging in a generic 65w or genuine dell 45w adapter yields the message from the dell power manager that \"the power adapter attached to your system is not recognized. attach a supported power adapter with at least 45 watts.\"i'm the it provider for the customer who owns the laptop and they have so many laptops floating around that i can't guarantee the genuine dell power adapter is the one that came with it. it does have the center pin on the plug.when i first got the laptop to diagnose, the battery power was completely gone. in fact, running the dell startup diagnostics said the battery was missing (it's really there and plugged in). plugging in the 2 aforementioned power adapters would allow the laptop to run, but the light next to the power jack would blink 4 or 5 times amber and then 1 time white over and over. bios says that the ac adapter is not installed.i happen to have a genuine dell 135w power adapter and i plugged it in and the laptop started, the light next to the jack was solid white and the bios said it was a 135w power supply. the battery charged to 100% and the laptop ran on battery after unplugging it.i understand that there is a special chip in the new genuine power adapters that communicates with the bios in the new laptops to indicate that the power adapter is of the proper wattage and is a genuine dell. dell support says the power adapter with the laptop was part kxttw. a google search shows that's model number la45nm140 which is the exact part number on the genuine dell 45w adapter that no longer charges (but does power up) the laptop.has anyone else experience this type issue and what do you think the next step is in diagnosing this?i did order a new battery, so i'll see if that's the issue. thanks for your assistance.solved!go to solution.according to dell's specifications, that laptop would need a 45-watt or 65-watt ac adapter.since your 135-watt adapter was recognized by that laptop's bios and charged the battery, i'd say that the user's adapter is the problem. he needs a genuine dell 45-watt or 65-watt (may depend upon the laptop's components) adapter. you could check to see if his current dell adapter has a bent or broken pin in the barrel connector. he may need a new dell adapter.and, i would do this:disconnect the ac adapter.disconnect the battery.press and hold the power button for 30 seconds to discharge any residual electricity.reconnect the ac adapterreboot the laptop.as for battery, you can test it. open an administrator cmd prompt (cmd, run as administrator).paste this command, and then press enter:powercfg /batteryreportthat will show a figure for the designed battery capacity (when new) and the current capacity.if you buy a new battery, ensure that it is a genuine dell battery. view solution in original postaccording to dell's specifications, that laptop would need a 45-watt or 65-watt ac adapter.since your 135-watt adapter was recognized by that laptop's bios and charged the battery, i'd say that the user's adapter is the problem. he needs a genuine dell 45-watt or 65-watt (may depend upon the laptop's components) adapter. you could check to see if his current dell adapter has a bent or broken pin in the barrel connector. he may need a new dell adapter.and, i would do this:disconnect the ac adapter.disconnect the battery.press and hold the power button for 30 seconds to discharge any residual electricity.reconnect the ac adapterreboot the laptop.as for battery, you can test it. open an administrator cmd prompt (cmd, run as administrator).paste this command, and then press enter:powercfg /batteryreportthat will show a figure for the designed battery capacity (when new) and the current capacity.if you buy a new battery, ensure that it is a genuine dell battery. filbert,i've done some more looking, prompted by your response. the genuine dell 45w power adapter does have the pin correctly situated. the upbright (generic) 90w power adapter had a pin, but it appears broken off. i sell these upbright adapters a lot because they work very well, until the pin is broken off. note that the customer had both of these adapters, so the pin was broken there. i pulled a brand new upbright a158 19.5v 4.62a adapter from my shelf and tested it. the bios shows it's a 90w adapter and windows no longer gives any warning messages.so, the result of my diagnostics is that the original genuine dell 45w power adapter is bad in that it no longer reports it's wattage value and therefore is unrecognized by the bios or windows as reliable and does not charge the battery. the original upbright adapter had a missing pin, so it had the same result. there were 2 separate issues with 2 separate adapters that caused the same problem on the laptop.thank you, filbert, for making me look twice. your solution will be gratefully accepted.\n",

      "content: hello,i have a vostro 7500 (just over 1 year old - passed warranty in aug of this year) and a d6000 docking station (bought at the same time).  up until recently i had the docking station connected to my laptop via usb-c which charged my laptop and gave me access to the docking station ports (hdmi, usb etc.).  about 1 month ago, my computer stopped recognizing the my docking station.  i moved to the usb type a plug instead (which is an adapter for usb-c to usb-a on the docking station) and now i'm using the usb port to get access to my docking station features.  however (for obvious reasons) the standard usb port is non-charging so i have to use 2 power supplies (one for docking station and one for laptop).long story short, how do i get my vostro to re-recognize the d6000 docking station via usb-c?  is this a docking station issue or a laptop issue? (i'm inclined towards a laptop issue)ps.  i've upgraded the d6000 firmware (which was only possible through the regular usb port as it wouldn't recognize through usb c) but that made no difference. any suggestions is appreciated. thank you. further to my message above, i've noticed that my vostro has a new bios firmware available that came out last week.  i proceeded to update the bios and while it was updating the bios i noticed a message that said \"main usb pd controller 1\"  -  \"firmware update failed\" i noticed all other bios components updated correctly except this.  i believe that the usb pd controller is responsible for the power delivery on the usb c port.   so the fact that the this failed might indicate an actual issue with the laptop.  if anyone has any other suggestions/opinions please let me know. if the usb port is bad, it's very unfortunate for me that the usb-c on this laptop died 3 months after it's 1 year warranty.thankshello, any updates since you posted, still having usb c issues, i have a vostro 7500 and i think mine is now having the same issue, and agree definitely poor that it could fail just over one year.  warranty or not i would expect support to respond to what the issue might be whether software or hardware.yes.i didn’t update in a while. i think one of the bios firmware updates improved the situation but i came up with a workaround that works for me reliably. here is what i have to do to make sure the docking station works using the usb c connector every single time  i always make sure that the laptop is on before i connect the docking station. if i connect the docking station when the laptop is sleeping or hibernating, the docking station won’t recognize when the computer comes out of hibernation or sleep. if that happens to me, i put the computer back to sleep, disconnect the docking station, wake up the computer, then i connect the docking station again. so far this has worked 100% of the time.  so i tend to believe there is a firmware issue still. at least i can deal with the docking station situation now.hope this helps someone.thanksadrian \n",

      "content: hello,i've had my dell vostro 35500 i5-2430m for 11 years and recently gave it a new ssd, fresh install and upgraded the bios a12.now i didn't realise that i'm able to upgrade the cpu and having looked on other discussions, i'm looking to upgrade to an i7 but a 3rd gen ivy bridge. the cpu i'm looking at is i7-3612qm which has 35w tdp (like my current cpu).would anyone know whether this would be a simple plug and play with the current bios? one of other options is te same gen i7-2620m but reading a discussion somewhere, i wouldn't see much benefit.any advice on this would be most appreciated.the fact that the vostro 3560 existed, and does support ivy bridge (3rd gen) suggests strongly that the 3550 will not.unless you have clear, verifiable evidence someone succeeded in running a 3rd gen core-i cpu on the 3550, proceed with the expectation the upgrade is more likely to fail than succeed. @ejn63 is spot on and his post in this thread would appear to confirm his statement.thanks for the reply. i've already seen that post and couldn't see where it suggest it would rule out completely the chances of this cpu working, other than that only the sandy bridge i7 was available (hence the post).i appreciate that it's a case of trial and error but was hoping someone here may have done this already.thanks for the reply, yes i was hoping someone may have already done this before buying and trying myself. i'll be honest i'm not that clued up with this stuff and thought whether there is a way to 'work out' whether that i7 is likely to work or not. just an example, this vostro i'm using, on paper the ram is supported up to 8gb. but someone (i can't remember which forum) managed to get 16gb of ram working based on the i5 being able to support this amount.so based on similar info/logic i was wondering whether that ivy bridge would be compatible based on motherboard/bios etc.support for more ram than initial specifications state is common, since memory modules that may not have been available when a system is designed and manufactured arrive later.support for a cpu is built into the system board and firmware.  since dell released the successor model (3560) that does support the next gen (ivy bridge) cpus, the odds are overwhelming that the reason you don't see reports of one working in the 3550 is that it will not.there isn't that much difference in performance between the sandy bridge and ivy bridge cpus, so you're likely better off with the former if you really want to upgrade the system you have.    thanks for the reply. yeah from what you and everyone is saying it seems unlikely it will work and they're not cheap enough to give it a go. appreciate everyone's help on this. \n",

      "content: so i just bought the 7590 and it has 3 useless keys, one to start the calculator, one that works as \"ce\" and one +/- that flips the sign in the calculator.dell seems to have followed lenovo and others with the dumb decision to make the \"fn\" behaviour of the f keys be the defaulti would have liked better to have a dedicated home/end key instead of having to press with fn (ok, i can fix that but then to press the f keys i would need the fn)the biggest problem is that the ce key is exactly the same as the delete key. i downloaded a keyboard mapper tool and the two keys are mapped to the same value and the +-/ key is mapped to the f9 key. so i guess i have to pick my poison: fix this and press the fn key to operate the function keys, or use the fn keys to use the home and end keysis there a solution for this, dell? i also need to remap the ce key without remapping the delete key. i am using latitude 5500.dell latitude 5501.have the same problem - the are four useless keys above numpad - \"calc\", \"ce\", \"=-\" and small backspace.it's absolutely senseless to duplicate keys which originals are situated almost at the same  place! i can't understand how it's possible!! there is just one key between \"delete\" and \"ce\" and main \"backspace\" is definitely more accessible than it's clone at the top right position. if dell decide to break traditional user experience it would be wise to give chance to remap keys for those users who use laptop as portable computer but not only as a expensive calculator.same issue here. i really want to disable the pgup and pgdn keys and replace those with the calculator and the ce keys. i can't use a key remapping app because the app things ce is the delete key.... any solution for this? that pgup/pgdn keys near the arrows are really bummer and same with the home and end that need to press the fn. who needs a key for the calculator, ce or +/- for whatever that exists in the first place? this isn't a perfect work around but it helped me to be able to use my function keys without losing a quickly accessible <home> and <end> key.it isn't marked on the keyboard but the following key mapping exist:fn + left arrow = homefn + right arrow = endi found that that was convenient enough to switch my function key row back to function keys, but we'll see how it works long term. painfull problem for me too.i need the home and end keys (as well as f keys) acessible with a single press. as mentioned above, it's impossible to remap unnecessary keys calc, ce, neg.i don't understand how a designer could have set aside the basic editing keys.still no solution?hi, this solution is not working...can you please elaboratesame problem here. using inspiron 5590. it's annoying. i mean who needs a short cut key for the calculator, ce and +/-?this is a worst keyboard layout i've ever seen. dell should provide some solution to this problem.same here. i was floored when i saw this. i need the home and end keys and i need the function keys all accessible without fn. i use those all the time.whoever designed this keyboard clearly didn't know what they were doing. the precision 3560 suffers the exact same problem.the equivalent latitude 5580 had a much better keyboard (1.5cm larger, 34.5 instead of 33):this can all be maintained even with narrower keyboard!please dell bring back the previous keyboard! (or even better with physical home/end like eg lenovo thinkpad e540)\n",

      "content: hello. recently i'm planning to add a 240gb ssd to my dell vostro 3546 laptop. i heard that my laptop don't have a m.2 slot for ssd. after searching in the internet i learned that i can replace my cd/dvd reader/writer module with my previous hdd and attach the new ssd to my hdd slot. is it possible? and will my ssd underperform in that scenario as it will be connected via a sata connector? also which all versions of sata connectors are available in my laptop?kindly help me with my queries soon as i've got only few days to do it.have a nice day.hey saurav,i also want to upgrade my dell vastro 3546. if you had got the solution please tell me too.i thought it is possible with sata 2.5 (7 mm) internal drive but not sure about, if there is different version of sata  you need to replace the existing drive with a 2.5\" sata ssd.  you may need a spacer to fit the ssd, which will almost certainly be slimmer than the hard drive:example:https://www.cdw.com/product/edge-7mm-to-9.5mm-ssd-spacer-adapter-for-2.5-drives/3817225 for ssd, you may use any 7mm (with a spacer/adapter) or 9.5mm sata ssd. an ssd will make your laptop much faster and more responsive, a noticeable difference.i can recommend crucial mx500 sata ssds. tests show them to have almost the performance of much more expensive competitors, yet the mx500 drives are more reasonably priced. they recently reduced the prices, so they are good value. they include the 7mm-to-9.5mm spacer/adapter. here are some on amazon. dell's owners manual for your model shows you how to open the laptop and replace the drive.whenever handling ram and touching internal components, wear a grounded wrist strap, also called anti-static wrist strap, esd wrist strap, or ground bracelet. i know many people do such work without this, but it's a cheap and sensible precaution. rest the laptop on an anti-static mat or at least a reasonable alternative such as corrugated cardboard. will samsung 870 evo 500gb sata 6.35 cm (2.5\") internal solid state drive (ssd) (mz-77e500) work? or crucial mx500 500gb 2.5\" ssdi am thinking to buy one of two? yes, they will work. depending upon how a drive fits in your laptop, you may need a 2.5mm adapter to better fit the 7mm drive in the 9.5mm bay. it's just a plastic frame. on my old dell xps laptop, i didn't need to use an adapter because the drive bracket holds the new drive so securely. you may or may not need one. crucial includes it, i don't know about samsung.\n",

      "content: hi i tried to replace the cpu of my old vostro1500, with a t9300.after replacing i start the pc but the display remain balck. after some test i connect external diplay and i could see that the pc work. the proble is the integrated display.i have one more vostro 1500 that not work, so i tried to switch the gpu card, but not working...i tried ti switch the display, but not working.so the promle is not the gpu or the display....someone have some ideas, why the display not work??there are a couple of possibilities.check with a bright flashlight -- do you see even a dim display on the screen?  if not, the screen needs to be replaced.if you do, that points to either the backlight (or inverter, which powers it), the power circuit to the inverter, or the video card itself.any replacement of the display or mainboard is probably going to cost more than the entire system is worth (figure that to be $50 in working condition), so repair is not going to be an economically viable option. thanks, for your advice.really i did a display test pressing at the same time start button and \"d\" keyboard button and the test was ok.the display went completely red, than green, etc... but at the end went black and nothig else... can't see anymore.i have to connect external display to use the pc.as i wrote i also tried to change the video card but the problem is the same.i know that the best thing is bought i new laptop, but i would like to understandwat is happened!if the display is ok during self-test, including the backlight, the gpu has failed.and yes, they can fail in such a way that an internal screen shows nothing while an external one works;  it's not all that uncommon and this is after all, a 15 year old system that has likely been used more with the internal display than the external monitor. many thanks.i'm not sure that the problem is the video card because, as i wrote, i tried to change with an other video card from another system, but i can't test the video cards in other system so i'm not certainty that they work. actually is very strange that two video card have the same problem at the same moent, but... i don't have other solution!\n",

      "content: good day, for last couple of months, my laptop is experiencing a disconnect-state from the wd19 ethernet port. i first thought it was the computer itself having difficulty so i simply plug the network cable into the laptop's own ethernet port but the sleep-mode routine does not reproduce this issue it only happens when using the wd19 and it's ethernet port. in windows event logs i also have numerous warning entries: \"eventid 1\", \"source rt640x64\", \"\\device\\ndmp3\\realtek pcie gbe family controller is disconnected from network.\" and the timestamps correspond with when the laptop went to sleep-mode.  the frustration is that the only possible way to \"re-connect\", is to power-cycle the wd19 itself because unplugging the ethernet cable, the usb-c cable(connected to the laptop), does not bring the connection back. what is also interesting is that windows seems to think that it is still connected: supplemental:- the wd19's firmware is already up-to-date:- i have already tried toggling this setting as described on this support article but it does not seem to have any effect on the issue =wd19/wd19s series dock ethernet port may intermittently disconnect when flow control is disabled- all computer drivers are up-to-date, using windows updates, using dell support app, using dell update app, and using dell driver checks via support pages. - windows is also up-to-date with the latest official public channel build: \"microsoft windows [version 10.0.19043.985]\".- windows store apps, all updated.- have done full anti-virus scans. (nothing found).- have tried sfc /scannow. (nothing corrupt).- have done dism /online /cleanup-image / scanhealth. (nothing wrong). thank you.    solved!go to solution.ok. dealing with this since october '20 when i got a 5410 and wd19 and i think i finally found the answer.forget about power settings, bios, event log, etc. waste of time.go to device manager, network adapters, realtek usb gbe family controller. you'll notice the driver is developed by realtek, right-click, select uninstall, and check the box that says delete files from disk.give it a few seconds to recompose, then action, scan for hardware changes. the realtek usb gbe family controller will appear again. big difference, however, the driver is from microsoft (right-click, properties).as long as the driver is from microsoft, you will not lose ethernet at the dock after a power save event.how do you keep it that way? well, two pesky pieces of software that came with your 5410 are determined to give realtek another chance. so here's what you need to do:- in dell command | update, go to the cog on the upper right corner, update filter, device category, and uncheck audio and network and bluetooth. click ok. that comes with the understanding that you will have to update drivers manually for these categories of course.but you are not done, and for weeks i kept wondering what else could be covertly updating a driver i explicitly filtered out. well, that is- supportassist. open it and click the cog on the upper right corner, choose settings, automate scans and optimizations, and uncheck scan your system and drivers at. so essentially, do not do any unauthorized updates to my computer. yes, again that means you do some driver updating manually. but again, no automated piece of half-thought software is going to bypass the driver filters you explicitly set to omit.ok, so with that my wd ethernet works and will continue to work after a power save event.view solution in original post* press windows + x* click device manager* open network adapters* find your ethernet connection/adapter in the list* double-click it* click the power management tab* remove checks from the following =reduce link speed during battery operationenergy efficient ethernetreduce link speed during system idle* note, i am using intel ethernet, so you may have other options to disableif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session.find your service taghi chris,no. the laptop's ethernet works as expected. the reason why the event log is showing it disconnecting is because there is no ethernet cable plugged into it. it's instead plugged into the wd19 ethernet port. so in summary: when the computer goes into sleep mode, the wd19's ethernet port does not \"return to life\" which is the issue i'm experiencing, where as if the cable is plugged into the laptop directly, then the the ethernet does continue to work as expected, when waking up. here is another screenshot when the wd19 ethernet \"is down\", so all i then do is power cycle the wd19 to make the ethernet work again:pertaining to your instructions - i understand that you want me to change some settings for the wd19 ethernet:the driver version:under the advanced tab i've applied the following changes, so please correct me if i did wrong:due to these changed, i'll apply it, restart and observe for a day or two and report back again. thank you.the above changes did not have any effect. please advise. hi there, please confirm if the issue remains the same after trying the suggested steps? #iwork4dellfind your service tagif still under warranty, click the \"get help now\" icon on the right to start a live chat session. to send us a private message, click our dell-cares username. our forum profile page will then appear. on the right, click \"send this user a private message\".we have exactly the same issue as described by cyberflake.our setup is:latitude 5410wd19 docking stationi have the same problem; when my xps 9570 wakes up from sleeping being connected to wd 19, ethernet says it is connected but i had to disable and enable the device by myself to have the working connection. we are seeing the same problem with our dell wd19tb docks and the commonality we have found is realtek. that is what is new with the new laptops we ordered. numerous people are having this issue coming from sleep and being connected to the dock. it is unfortunate with their new shiny laptops that this is happening.the network in the dock gets an ip address, can ping itself, ping the gateway, but nothing further than the gateway. if you disconnect and reconnect, can resolve, if you reboot, resolves.we have been testing various things and we found that disabling flow control under the advanced settings appears to fix this for us. we have been unable to reproduce the issue since making that change.@cyberflake i see you haven't tried disabling this yet in your advanced tab list, try that out and let us know if that fixes it for you too.we really hope that this issue can get resolved, we have tried multiple things and this is the only fix we have found. ideally we have updated drivers from dell that resolve this problem or some other avenue. realtek is used by a lot of vendors like usb network dongles and this setting has to be applied to every single network adapter, any new one connected, have to apply this setting to that new network adapter. changed to a different dock? reapply the fix again.we are on the latest dell drivers, latest dock firmware, latest thunderbolt drivers, etc. we also have tried the latest drivers from realtek site directly and doesn't resolve.please advise @dell-cares ok. dealing with this since october '20 when i got a 5410 and wd19 and i think i finally found the answer.forget about power settings, bios, event log, etc. waste of time.go to device manager, network adapters, realtek usb gbe family controller. you'll notice the driver is developed by realtek, right-click, select uninstall, and check the box that says delete files from disk.give it a few seconds to recompose, then action, scan for hardware changes. the realtek usb gbe family controller will appear again. big difference, however, the driver is from microsoft (right-click, properties).as long as the driver is from microsoft, you will not lose ethernet at the dock after a power save event.how do you keep it that way?

the analogy is buying a car and finding out there is no connection between the motor and the wheels! dealing with dell is terrible. the indian call centre is rubbish. they either are incompetent or out right lie about issues. given that the vostro / inspiron 7510 shares the bios with the inspiron 7610, there is a reasonable chance that both systems are structurally identical.if these systems are structurally identical, i can report that on the inspiron 7610 with rtx 3060 the nvidia gpu is (only) wired to the usb-c / thunderbolt output port - and the intel gpu is (only) wired to the hdmi output port.i am unable to make any statements on g-sync, as i am unable to test this.i believe that dell first-level support does not have any malicious intent; they are, most likely, just woefully under-equipped and their ability to provide support is limited to the \"where is the power button\" kind of request.that being said, i am totally unhappy with dell first-level support, as i appear to have no means to escalate my highly technical problem to a level which might actually be enabled to address it (firmware / bios defects)i'm not an expert of laptops, but try disabling the laptop screen and make the monitor as your main screen.\n",

(they might have been created when i restored a backup after resetting windows due to a problem downloading the august windows update.) i suspect that the unspecified partition is a mistake, but i would like to hear from someone at dell whether the two recovery partitions are there by design, hence that they shouldn't be combined.i installed and ran easeus partition master (https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-free.html), which revealed that the unnamed mystery 1.13 gb partition is reserved for winre (windows recovery environment---see https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-recovery-environment-explained/ba...). i'd say it's a design flaw that this information doesn't appear in the windows disk management app.still don't know what the two other recovery partitions are individually for, but that's more of academic than practical interest.terry\n",

sense that it’s a directly business-oriented line, but latitudes are more expensive, and this is the current top-end model of the lineup.@jphughan thanks for the info. it's a situational issue.  this laptop sits on a small table about 4\" above the arm rest of a theater chair, so my left elbow rests on the arm rest and my arm is elevated up to the keyboard.  my arm rests on the laptop corner and i can work for hours like this.  with the shifted touch pads, my wrist rests right on the corner and that gets painful after about 10 minutes.  this setup is about 99% of this laptops function, and i need it to be comfortable.  i tried using a m2800 but wound up giving it to my wife and my g3 i5 vostro is getting a bit long in the tooth.the irritating thing is, dell's website is all but worthless as far as showing the features of their laptops!  only the xps has a clear picture of the keyboard.  the rest don't and the descriptions are just not there. you have to read between the lines to figure out things like keyboard layout.  even the chat people can't figure it out.  i spent hours with chat and looking over the webpage and could not figure it out.  several correct pictures and it would have taken minutes to find what i want. but thanks for the information.  this will help me a lot! @arcamm  happy to help, and i absolutely agree about the difficulty in getting a detailed photo of a given laptop's keyboard layout.  i've sometimes had luck with third party review sites if i can't find what i need from dell.  and i absolutely scrutinize the keyboard layout, because i'm a heavy user of keyboard shortcuts, so i care where keys like pgup/dn and home/end are located, whether there are dedicated keys of fn-mapped keys for those purposes, etc.  and that incidentally reminds me of one of the issues with the new xps 15 9500.  previous xps 15 models had home/end mapped to fn+left/right, but with the new 9500, dell moved those to be mapped as fn+f11 and f12 or something, and they removed the ability to trigger those functions via fn+left/right, even though nothing else was mapped to that combination.  the aggravation there is that pgup and pgdn are still in the arrow key area where they've always been, which means that even though pgup/dn and home/end are often used together to navigate various interfaces, they're now on opposite ends of the keyboard rather than right near each other.  dell made that change on the xps 13 model line a few generations ago, and it has provoked several gripe threads here, some of them quite long, and predictably when they more recently did this on the xps 15 and new xps 17, it's provoking gripes from buyers of those systems.  some have gone as far as returning the system over this, and i can see why.the most frustrating thing of all is that it would be absolutely trivial for dell to provide a firmware update to restore the ability also activate home/end via fn+left/right even if those keys aren't marked as such.  (this incidentally is the exact design lenovo implements on some of their systems....)  i hope that whoever within dell pushed for this design change starting years ago with the xps 13 sees the error of their ways and relents, ideally including a firmware update for existing systems rather than just fixing this for future systems.skip forward to 2022 , just wen t to buy a dell 2 in one and all models now dont have numeric keypads, even the top of the line latitude business  9510 series , none of the latitude , on the vostro models have a numeric keypad included in the keyboard layout , and there is no touch screen model on the vostro, why on earth would dell remove the numeric keypad on a huge range if business computers ?yea for dell for removing the numeric pad (at least as an option)!  i'm tired of sitting off-center of my laptop for those rarely-used keys (i'm a software engineer, not an accountant).\n",

      "content: i bought a new dell vostro 3400 laptop in november 2021 getting to january 2022 i started having issues with the new laptop, at first it started with the screen glitching it happened two more times and on february 8 2022 that was the day i used the pc last, it glitched and went off when i tried turning it back on all i saw was a blank screen and the cooling fan overworking like i could hear the sound which on a normal day makes no noise. the laptop is now in my cupboard collecting dust while i went back to my 11 years old lenovo ideapad y570. it really hurts me whenever i see the laptop. am in nigeria and here they don't respect warranties or guarantee so it's a cross for me to bear so i will love it if you guys really improve on your hardware's and cooling system, because am having a feeling that it a fault from the processor. to clear the air i wasn't using the pc for any intensive work i only had two programs installed on it which was vscode and pycharm which i used for python development.\n",
